This thought of “coming into the world” is frequent in St. John. (Comp. especially <a href="/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>; <a href="/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That I should bear witness unto the truth.</span>—Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a>. He has indeed a kingdom, and He came into the world to be a king; but His rule is that of the majesty of Truth, and His kingdom is to be established by His witness of the eternal truth which He had known with His Father, and which He alone could declare to man. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>.) He came to be a witness—a martyr—to the truth, and to send forth others to be witnesses and martyrs to the same truth, through the Holy Spirit, who should guide them into all truth. Such was His kingdom; such the power by which it was to rule. It was not of this world: it possessed neither land nor treasury, neither senate nor legions, neither consuls nor procurators; but it was to extend its sceptre over all the kingdoms of the earth.<p><span class= "bld">Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</span>—He has spoken of His kingdom. Who are its subjects, and what its power over them? Every one is included who, following the light which God has placed in his soul, comes to “the true Light which lighteth every man;” who, made in the image of God, and with capacities for knowing God, seeks truly to know Him; every one who, in an honest and true heart, is of the truth, and-therefore hears the voice of Him who is the Truth. The thought is familiar to us from the earlier chapters of the Gospel. (Comp. <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>; <a href="/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>; <a href="/john/8-47.htm" title="He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.">John 8:47</a>; <a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:33-40 Art thou the King of the Jews? that King of the Jews who has been so long expected? Messiah the Prince; art thou he? Dost thou call thyself so, and wouldest thou be thought so? Christ answered this question with another; not for evasion, but that Pilate might consider what he did. He never took upon him any earthly power, never were any traitorous principles or practices laid to him. Christ gave an account of the nature of his kingdom. Its nature is not worldly; it is a kingdom within men, set up in their hearts and consciences; its riches spiritual, its power spiritual, and it glory within. Its supports are not worldly; its weapons are spiritual; it needed not, nor used, force to maintain and advance it, nor opposed any kingdom but that of sin and Satan. Its object and design are not worldly. When Christ said, I am the Truth, he said, in effect, I am a King. He conquers by the convincing evidence of truth; he rules by the commanding power of truth. The subjects of this kingdom are those that are of the truth. Pilate put a good question, he said, What is truth? When we search the Scriptures, and attend the ministry of the word, it must be with this inquiry, What is truth? and with this prayer, Lead me in thy truth; into all truth. But many put this question, who have not patience to preserve in their search after truth; or not humility enough to receive it. By this solemn declaration of Christ's innocence, it appears, that though the Lord Jesus was treated as the worst of evil-doers, he never deserved such treatment. But it unfolds the design of his death; that he died as a Sacrifice for our sins. Pilate was willing to please all sides; and was governed more by worldly wisdom than by the rules of justice. Sin is a robber, yet is foolishly chosen by many rather than Christ, who would truly enrich us. Let us endeavour to make our accusers ashamed as Christ did; and let us beware of crucifying Christ afresh.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art thou a king then? - Dost thou admit the charge in any sense, or dost thou lay claim to a kingdom of any kind?<p>Thou sayest ... - This is a form of expression denoting affirmation. It is equivalent to yes.<p>That I am a king - This does not mean simply that Pilate affirmed that he was a king; it does not appear that he had done this; but it means, "Thou affirmest the truth; thou declarest what is correct, for I am a king." I am a king in a certain sense, and do not deny it.<p>To this end ... - Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11-12</a>, etc. Jesus does not here affirm that he was born to reign, or that this was the design of his coming; but it was to bear witness to and to exhibit the truth. By this he showed what was the nature of his kingdom. It was not to assert power; not to collect armies; not to subdue nations in battle. It was simply to present truth to men, and to exercise dominion only by the truth. Hence, the only power put forth in restraining the wicked, in convincing the sinner, in converting the heart, in guiding and leading his people, and in sanctifying them, is that which is produced by applying truth to the mind. Men are not forced or compelled to be Christians. They are made to see that they are stoners, that God is merciful, that they need a Redeemer, and that the Lord Jesus is fitted to their case, and yield themselves then wholly to his reign. This is all the power ever used in the kingdom of Christ, and no men in his church have a right to use any other. Alas! how little have persecutors remembered this! And how often, under the pretence of great regard for the kingdom of Jesus, have bigots attempted by force and flames to make all men think as they do! We see here the importance which Jesus attached to truth. It was his sole business in coming into the world. He had no other end than to establish it. We therefore should value it, and seek for it as for hid treasures, <a href="/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a>.<p>Every one ... - See <a href="/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. Art thou a king then?&#8212;There was no sarcasm or disdain in this question (as Tholuck, Alford, and others, allege), else our Lord's answer would have been different. Putting emphasis upon "thou," his question betrays a mixture of surprise and uneasiness, partly at the possibility of there being, after all, something dangerous under the claim, and partly from a certain awe which our Lord's demeanor probably struck into him.<p>Thou sayest that I am a king&#8212;It is even so.<p>To this end was I&#8212;"have I been."<p>born and for this cause came I&#8212;am I come.<p>into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth&#8212;His birth expresses His manhood; His coming into the world, His existence before assuming humanity: The truth, then, here affirmed, though Pilate would catch little of it, was that His Incarnation was expressly in order to the assumption of Royalty in our nature. Yet, instead of saying, He came to be a King, which is His meaning, He says He came to testify to the truth. Why this? Because, in such circumstances it required a noble courage not to flinch from His royal claims; and our Lord, conscious that He was putting forth that courage, gives a turn to His confession expressive of it. It is to this that Paul alludes, in those remarkable words to Timothy: "I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who, in the presence of Pontius Pilate, witnessed the good confession" (1Ti 6:13). This one act of our Lord's life, His courageous witness-bearing before the governor, was selected as an encouraging example of the fidelity which Timothy ought to display. As the Lord (says Olshausen beautifully) owned Himself the Son of God before the most exalted theocratic council, so He confessed His regal dignity in presence of the representative of the highest political authority on earth.<p>Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice&#8212;Our Lord here not only affirms that His word had in it a self-evidencing, self-recommending power, but gently insinuated the true secret of the growth and grandeur of His kingdom&#8212;as A Kingdom of truth, in its highest sense, into which all souls who have learned to live and count all things but loss for the truth are, by a most heavenly attraction, drawn as into their proper element; THE King of whom Jesus is, fetching them in and ruling them by His captivating power over their hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Art thou a king then?</span> Pilate seems to have spoken this rather in derision and mockery, than out of any desire to catch him in his words. Christ neither owneth himself to be a king, nor yet denieth it, but tells Pilate that he said so; and to this end he was born, and for this cause he came into the world, to bear testimony to the truth: i.e. I cannot deny but that I have a spiritual kingdom, that is truth, and I must attest the truth; it was a part of my errand into the world; and every one who is by Divine grace disposed to believe and love the truth, will hear and obey my doctrine. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Pilate therefore said unto him,....

The end of Christ's being born, which was of a virgin, in a very miraculous manner, and of his coming into the world, which was by the assumption of human nature, among many other things, was to bear testimony to truth in general; to the whole Gospel, the word of truth, and every branch of it, which he brought with him, constantly preached in life, and confirmed by his death; and particularly to this truth, that he was a King, and had a kingdom in a spiritual sense: <p>everyone that is of the truth; that is of God, belongs to the sheep of Christ, knows the truth as it is in Jesus, and is on the side of truth, and stands by it: <p>heareth my voice; the voice of his Gospel; and that not only externally, but internally; so as to approve of it, rejoice at it, and distinguish it; and the voice of his commands, so as cheerfully to obey them from a principle of love to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then?

Pilate understands only so far as to interrupt with <span class="greekheb">Οὐκοῦν</span> … <span class="greekheb">σύ</span>; “So then you are a king?” On <span class="greekheb">οὐκοῦν</span> see Klotz’s <span class="ital">Devarius</span>, p. 173. To which Jesus replies with the explicit statement: <span class="greekheb">Σὺ λέγεις</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>. “Thou sayest.” This, says Schoettgen (<a href="/matthew/26-25.htm" title="Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said to him, You have said.">Matthew 26:25</a>), is “solennis adfirmantium apud Judaeos formula”; so that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> must be rendered with R.V[92] marg. “because” I am a king. Erasmus, Westcott, Plummer, and others render, “Thou sayest that I am a king,” neither definitely accepting nor rejecting the title. But this interpretation seems impossible in the face of the simple <span class="greekheb">σὺ λέγεις</span> of the synoptists, <a href="/matthew/27-2.htm" title="And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.">Matthew 27:2</a>, <a href="/mark/15-2.htm" title="And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews?

Both verbs are perfects and express not merely a past event but one which continues in its effects; Christ has come and remains in the world. The pronoun is very emphatic; in this respect Christ stands alone among men. The verbs point to His previous existence with the Father, although Pilate would not see this. The expression ‘come into the world’ is frequent in S.

Both these expressions, ‘witness’ and ‘truth,’ have been seen to be very frequent in S. John (see especially chaps. 1, 3, 5, 8. <span class="ital">passim</span>).

This is the object of Christ’s sovereignty,—to bear witness to the Truth. It is characteristic of the Gospel that it claims to be ‘the Truth.’ “This title of the Gospel is not found in the Synoptists, Acts, or Apocalypse; but it occurs in the Catholic Epistles (<a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm" title="And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.">2 Peter 2:2</a>) and in S.

Here Pilate flashes out with haughty rebuke. He had satisfied himself that Jesus was no political rival; hut, in wonderment and scorn, he would sound a little deeper the mystery of the kingly claim. It is not a judicial inquiry, but a burst of ironical surprise: <span class="accented">So then</span>, <span class="accented">after all</span>, <span class="accented">thou art a King</span>, <span class="accented">even then?</span> wavering between positive and negative reply. Hengstenberg sees neither irony nor scorn in the <span class="accented">obsess</span>, but a certain amount of disturbed equanimity. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Thou sayest it, that I am a King.</span> This mode of affirmation is not found in classical Greek or the LXX., but occurs in the New Testament, and in the synoptists also it is given as the great answer of Jesus. Some have translated the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as "for" or "because," and added "well" and "rightly" to the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus: <span class="accented">Thou sayest well</span>, <span class="accented">for I am a King</span>. Hengstenberg and Lampe separate this declaration from what follows, which they interpret exclusively of the prophetic office of Jesus: but the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points backwards as well as forwards, and our Lord accepts that which he proceeds to explain as his royal functions. Westcott, however, says that Jesus neither accepts nor rejects the title of King, but simply reiterates Pilate's words, "Thou sayest that I am a King; I will proceed to explain what I mean by my royal mission." Seeing, however, that our Lord had already implicitly avowed his kingly state, it is far better to discern in the reply an acknowledgment of the inference which Pilate had scornfully drawn (see parallel method of answering the question, "Art thou the Son of God?" <a href="/luke/22-70.htm">Luke 22:70</a>, "Ye say that I am;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> compared with <a href="/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>). This is the "good confession" to which St. Paul referred (<a href="/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>). This is the assumption, before the tribunal of the whole world, that he was and would forever remain its true King. <span class="cmt_word">To this end have I been born</span>. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is an important admission of his true humanity, which Keim and others are unwilling to find in the Fourth Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And to this end have I come into the world.</span> These words are not tautological. In the first clause he asserts his birth as a man, in the second he refers to the state of being which preceded his incarnation (cf. here <a href="/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>, note), out of which he came, and to which he is now returning. The being "born" of woman is one fact, the "coming into this world" is another which he makes antithetical to his return to the Father. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, present perfect, being used instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and implies that his "coming is permanent in its effects, and not simply a past historic fact" (Westcott). <span class="cmt_word">In order that I might bear witness unto the truth.</span> This is his supreme claim. There is an absolute reality. God's way of thinking about things is the closest approximation we can make to the concept of "truth <span class="accented">per se</span>." In this is comprehended all the reality of the Divine nature and character; all that the eternal God thinks concerning man and the laws which have been given him, and concerning the failure of man to realize God's idea of what he ought to have been; all the absolute fact, just as it really is, of man's peril and his prospects, the actual relations between body and spirit, between the individual and the community; all man's positive need of redemption; all the deep mystery of Christ's own Person and work. These constitute the mighty realm of things, beings, duties, and prospects, which we call truth. Jesus said he had been born and had come into the world in order to bear witness to truth. From John the Baptist's standpoint, that prophet bore witness concerning the <span class="accented">light</span> (<a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8</a>), and, according to the range of his vision, he too (<a href="/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>) bore "witness to the truth" (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. so far as he knew it) of the Christ. Our Lord now solemnly declares that he himself came to bear witness to THE TRUTH in all its amplitude. Hengstenberg sees in these words simply a reference here to the <span class="accented">prophetic</span> office of Christ; but the next clause shows that our Lord is actually defining by this claim the extent of the <span class="accented">kingdom</span> that is "not from hence" or from this world as its origin. <span class="cmt_word">Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice</span>. To "hear the voice" is to obey as a supreme authority (<a href="/john/10-8.htm">John 10:8, 16, 27</a>), and the phrase shows how widely the thought ranges. Every mind open to the influence of truth, every one who is set against the unrealities of mere opinion or tradition, who derives life and joy from the realm of reality, every one who therefore knows how different he might be, how much he needs, who is "of God," as the Source and Beginning and Ground of all things. Compare here the remarkable parallel to this sentiment, John rift. 47; and also the words of the high-priestly prayer, "All thine are mine, and mine are thine," and "Those whom thou hast given me are thine; thine they were, and thou gavest them me." The same large embrace of human souls is conspicuous here, <span class="accented">Every one that is of the truth</span> heareth the voice of Christ, and will accept his authority as final and supreme. The sublime witness to the truth which he had been bearing, in this manifestation of the Name of the Father, would make the voice of Jesus the imperial and august authority for all who fell how much they needed truth. The Sanhedrists said that "truth is the seal of God," and they played upon the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span> or "truth," by making it equivalent to the first and middle and last of all things, seeing that <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x20;&#x5d0;</span>, are the first, middle, and last of the letters of the alphabet <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Art thou then (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;)<p>The interrogative particle &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, not therefore, occurs only here in the New Testament.

"The one, addressed to the Jews, is framed in the language of prophecy; the other, addressed to a Roman, appeals to the universal testimony of conscience.
