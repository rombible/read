The particulars have been noticed in the remarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needs another to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate.

Interpreters differ as to whether it was a blow with a rod, or with the hand. The kindred verb &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, from &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, a rod, is etymologically related to &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, from &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a rod, and occurs <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, of smiting on the cheek, and <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>, where it is distinguished from &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, to strike with the fist. This latter passage, however, leaves the question open, since, if the meaning to smite with a rod can be defended, there is nothing to prevent its being understood there in that sense. The earlier meaning of the word was, undoubtedly, according to its etymology, to smite with a rod. So Herodotus of Xerxes. "It is certain that he commanded those who scourged (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;.&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) the waters (of the Hellespont) to utter, as they lashed them, these barbarian and wicked words" (vii., 35). And again: "The Corinthian captain, Adeimantus, observed, 'Themistocles, at the games they who start too soon are scourged (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)'" (viii., 59). It passes, in classical Greek, from this meaning to that of a light blow with the hand. The grammarian Phrynichus (A. D. 180) condemns the use of the word in the sense of striking with the hand, or slapping, as not according to good Attic usage, and says that the proper expression for a blow on the cheek with the open hand is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. This shows that the un-Attic phrase had crept into use. In the Septuagint the word is clearly used in the sense of a blow with the hand. See <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a> : "I gave my cheeks to blows (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;.&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;). <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a>, "As a man that smiteth (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) upon his cheeks" (A.V. and Rev., that take off the yoke on their jaws). In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>, we read, "Zedekiah - smote Micaiah on the cheek (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)." The word in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/18-23.htm">John 18:23</a>, &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, literally, flayest, hence, do beat or thrash (compare <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47</a>), seems better to suit the meaning strike with a rod; yet in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>, that verb is used of smiting in the face (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, where Paul is using the figure of a boxer, he says, "So fight I((&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;, of boxing, or fighting with the fists), not as one that beateth (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) the air." These examples practically destroy the force of the argument from &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. It is impossible to settle the point conclusively; but, on the whole, it seems as well to retain the rendering of the A.V. and Rev. </body></html>
