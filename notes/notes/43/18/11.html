Then said Jesus&#8212;"Suffer ye thus far" (Lu 22:51).<p>Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?&#8212;This expresses both the feelings which struggled in the Lord's breast during the Agony in the garden&#8212;aversion to the cup viewed in itself, but, in the light of the Father's will, perfect preparedness to drink it. (See on [1888]Lu 22:39-46). Matthew adds to the address to Peter the following:&#8212;"For all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword" (Mt 26:52)&#8212;that is, 'Those who take the sword must run all the risks of human warfare; but Mine is a warfare whose weapons, as they are not carnal, are attended with no such hazards, but carry certain victory.' "Thinkest thou that I cannot now"&#8212;even after things have proceeded so far&#8212;"pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me"&#8212;rather, "place at My disposal"&#8212;"more than twelve legions of angels"; with allusion, possibly, to the one angel who had, in His agony, "appeared to Him from heaven strengthening Him" (Lu 22:43); and in the precise number, alluding to the twelve who needed the help, Himself and His eleven disciples. (The full complement of a legion of Roman soldiers was six thousand). "But how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be?" (Mt 26:53, 54). He could not suffer, according to the Scripture, if He allowed Himself to be delivered from the predicted death. "And He touched his ear and healed him" (Lu 22:51); for "the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them" (Lu 9:56), and, even while they were destroying His, to save theirs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The other evangelists report this part of the history with many more circumstances; particularly our Saviour’s miraculous healing Malchus again; <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/26-51.htm" title="And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.">Matthew 26:51</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/26-54.htm" title="But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?">Matthew 26:54</a></span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/mark/14-47.htm" title="And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.">Mark 14:47</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/14-49.htm" title="I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.">Mark 14:49</a></span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/22-50.htm" title="And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.">Luke 22:50</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/22-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Suffer you thus far.

By way of rebuke, and to prevent his repeating the blow, and that further mischief might not ensue; for such a bold imprudent action risked the lives of all the disciples, who, in all probability, would have fallen a sacrifice to the fury and resentment of these men, had not Christ interposed in this prudent manner; who, also, Luke says, touched the servant's ear and healed him, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-51.htm">Luke 22:51</a>, which no doubt tended greatly to conciliate their minds, and make them easy: <p>put up thy sword into the sheath: Peter was not a proper person to bear the sword, and use it; it was a very daring attack, and a dangerous one, and was very unnecessary; since Christ could have defended himself, had he thought fit, without Peter's drawing his sword; and besides, for a word speaking, he could have had of his Father more than twelve legions of angels; and it was also contrary to the nature of his kingdom, which was not of this world, nor to be supported and defended in any such manner; and was, moreover, as much as in Peter lay, an hinderance of his sufferings, and of the execution of his Father's will and decree; wherefore he adds, <p>the cup which my Father hath given me: by the cup is meant, the wrath of God, and punishment due to sin, endured by Christ in his sufferings, and is said to be given him by his Father; because he called him to these sufferings, they were appointed and determined by him; yea, he was even ordered, and commanded by his Father, to drink of this cup; justice mixed it up, and put it into his hands; and he took it as coming from his Father, who delighted in seeing him drink it up, as the stately of his people; and a dreadful one it was, a cup of trembling and astonishment, of curse, and not of blessing, of wrath and fury: the allusion seems to be to the master of the family, who appointed, and gave to everyone their cup: <p>shall I not drink it? which expresses his, willingness to do it, his eager desire after it, his delight in it, and displeasure at Peter's attempt to hinder him; he being now perfectly reconciled in his human nature to drink it, though it was so bitter a potion: he found it was impossible, considering the decree of God, his own agreement, and the salvation of his people, that it should be otherwise; and besides, it was his Father's will and pleasure, he considered it as coming from him; and therefore cheerfully accepted it, and was, resolved to drink it up, and that nothing should hinder him. The Persic version reads it, "I will not give it to another to drink"; Peter, by this rash action, seeming as if he would have the cup out of Christ's hands, and have drank it himself; which, as it could not be, nor would Christ suffer it, so if he had, it would have been of no advantage to the salvation of his people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/18.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/18-11.htm" title="Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?">John 18:11</a>.

Something must have restrained the baud and the high priest's own temple-watch from at once arresting Peter, if not the entire group. The characteristic touch, descriptive of our Lord's most Divine compassion, is in itself valuable, but it also accounts for the immunity of Peter. The solemn rebuke of Peter is full of Divine meaning, and is another link with the synoptic narrative of the agony. "Put up," or more literally, <span class="cmt_word">Cast the</span> <span class="cmt_word">sword into its sheath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is the classical word; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> more generally used of repository, receptacle, sepulcher, etc.); or into its hiding-place; bury it away (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in Matthew). Matthew adds a memorable saying, but is silent as to the deep Divine reason of the submission of our Lord to his fate. <span class="cmt_word">The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it</span>? This imagery recalls the Passion, through which we learn from the synoptists that our Lord had passed into a Divine patience and submission to the will of God (<a href="/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). The use of this most remarkable phraseology recalls that which John too had heard from his lips in the sweat of his agony, and of which he and Peter were the principal witnesses. The supplementary character of the Gospel, though by no means sufficient to account for all the omissions and additions of this narrative, yet does explain very much. "Jesus is now of his own accord at the disposal of his enemies; his words have put a stop to all further steps taken for his defense" (Moulton).
