The particulars have been noticed in the remarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needs another to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate. He reasoned with the man that did him the injury, and so may we.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-72.htm">Matthew 26:72-74</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

This is repeated from <a href="/john/18-18.htm">John 18:18</a> to connect the history, and carry on the thread of the account of Peter's denial of Christ, which is interrupted by inserting the examination of Christ before the high priest, which was made at the same time. Peter stood among, and continued with the servants and officers of the high priest, warming himself by a fire they had made, it being a cold night; and this proved of bad consequence to him. The company and conversation of wicked men should be abstained from; no good is got thereby; continuance among such is very dangerous; men are too often more concerned for their bodies than their souls; Satan baits his temptations for the fleshly and sensitive part; and that which is thought to be for good, is the occasion of hurt. <p>They said therefore unto him; the servants and officers, among whom he stood warming himself, having observed what the maid had said to him: <p>art thou not also one of his disciples? suspecting that he was, though he had denied it, and therefore press him to give a direct answer: they might observe his countenance to fall, when the maid put the question to him; there might be something in his dress, and especially in his speech, which increased the suspicion: <p>but he denied it, and said, I am not; a second time. This denial of his being a disciple of Christ, as before, did not arise from a sense of his unworthiness to be one; nor from diffidence and distrust of a right to such a character; but from the fear of men; and being ashamed of Christ, he denies that which was his great mercy, privilege, and glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself.

In startling contrast to this scene, and while Annas had completed his bad-hearted but foiled inquisition, possibly even while our Lord was being transferred from the one court to the other - an event which provided an opportunity for the searching, loving, compassionate glance which broke Peter's heart - the second and third denials of Peter were also being enacted. <span class="cmt_word">Now Simon Peter</span>, who had been challenged by the doorkeeper, <span class="cmt_word">was standing and warming himself</span> (a form of verbal construction of auxiliary verb with participle to which John is addicted, and especially in those portions of his Gospel which represent his personal composition; <a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6, 9, 24, 27</a>; <a href="/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24, 27</a>) - "standing," not "sitting," as Luke describes his position at the <span class="accented">first</span> denial, having, we might suppose, impetuously changed his position. <span class="cmt_word">They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples?</span> This sentence of John really gathers up another moment of Peter's terrible fall, variously and even discrepantly put by the synoptic narrative, and is virtually accordant with them all three. According to Matthew "another maid," according to Mark "the maid" who had first challenged him, returned to the assault. Nothing more likely than that what was said by one woman should be eagerly taken up by another, and therefore that both statements are true. Luke, however, describes the event thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "another man" (perhaps "a different person") saw him and said, "Thou art one of them." John's statement embraces the substance of all three statements, "They said unto him." The general resemblance of the second charge brought against the apostle, as stated by all four evangelists, is remarkable. The different personages by whose lips the charge was urged can best be explained by the occurrence of simultaneous and widely spreading conviction, instead of an unnecessary multiplication of the denials themselves. Matthew and Mark represent Peter as overhearing the conversation of the maids with those who were there (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), showing the obvious occasion for some eager <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to take up their statement as an accusation. The difficulty of place is not so easily resolved, for Matthew and Mark speak of the "gate," <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "porch," outer hall of the court, and John of the fire where Peter first sat in apparent unconcern. We do not know how near the fire was to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, whether it was not indeed between the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, in the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. According to Matthew he was moving towards the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, probably in the stir of the procession from the house of Annas to the court of Caiaphas. The four evangelists agree in the declaration made by Peter. <span class="cmt_word">He denied, and said, I am not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I am not one of the disciples concerning whom Annas asks. "I do not know the Man." </body></html>
