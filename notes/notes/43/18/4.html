It must be supposed, that after Judas had kissed our Saviour, our Saviour himself came forth and asked him whom they looked for; hereby showing that he laid down his life, and no man took it from him: he could easily have delivered himself out of their hands, (though I think they are too charitable to Judas, who think that it was that which made Judas discover him; not that he designed his death), he had once and again before so escaped them; but now his hour was come, he freely offers himself unto his enemies, and asketh whom they looked for. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus therefore knowing all things,....

But this is perfectly compatible with the obvious fact that the eight disciples and the favored three should have shrunk behind our Lord when he calmly emerged from the entrance to the garden, and that their position would be thus sufficiently indicated. It is remarkable that John, who has been accused of personal malice to Judas (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by those who, like Renan, admit, to a certain extent, the Johan-nine authorship), does not refer to the traitor's kiss.
