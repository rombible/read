He had before said, “I pray” (<a href="/john/17-9.htm" title="I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.">John 17:9</a>, and Note on <a href="/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a>), but the thought of the union with the Father, expressed in <a href="/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>, leads to the fuller expression of His confidence that the prayer will be answered.<p>For the words, “with Me where I am,” comp.

That we are to think of the future glory of the divine-human nature of Christ, is shown by the addition of the words, “which Thou hast given Me.” The pre-incarnate glory of the Son was of His divine nature only, and is not, therefore, spoken of as given to Him, nor could it be given to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/17-22.htm" title="And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:">John 17:22</a>).

The prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘I will’ has a strange ring of authority. It is the expression of His love to men, and of His longing for their presence with Him in His glory. Not till they are with Him there, shall He ‘see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have here a glimpse of the blessed state of the dead in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {a} Local presence with Christ. His glorified body is somewhere. The value of this thought is that it gives solidity to our ideas of a future life. There they are. We need not dwell on the metaphysical difficulties about locality for disembodied spirits.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If a spirit can be localised in a body, I suppose it can be localised without a body; but passing by all that, we have the hope held out here of a real local presence with the glorified humanity of our Lord. We speak of the dead as gone from us, and we have that idea far more vividly in our minds than that of their having gone to Him. We speak of the ‘departed,’ but we do not think of them as ‘arrived.’ We look down to the narrow grave, but we forget ‘He is not here, He is risen. Why seek ye the living among the dead?’ Ah! if we could only bring home to our hearts the solid prose of the conviction that where Christ is there His servants are, and that not in the diffused ubiquity of His Divine Omnipresence, it would go far to remove the darkness and vague mist which wrap the future, and to set it as it really is before us, as a solid definite reality. We see the sails glide away out into the west as the sun goes down, and we think of them as tossing on a midnight sea, an unfathomable waste. Try to think of them more truly. As in that old miracle, He comes to them walking on the water in the night watch, and if at first they are terrified, His voice brings back hope to the heart that is beginning to stand still, and immediately they are at the land whither they go. Now, as they sink from our sight, they are in port, sails furled and anchor dropped, and green fields round them, even while we watch the sinking masts, and cannot yet rightly tell whether the fading sail has faded wholly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {b} Communion with Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Our Lord says not only ‘that where I am, they also may be,’ but adds ‘with Me.’ That is not a superfluous addition, but emphasises the thought of a communion which is more intimate and blessed than local presence alone would be.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The communion here is real but imperfect. It is perfected there on our part by the dropping away of flesh and sin, by change of circumstances, by emancipation from cares and toils necessary here, by the development of new powers and surroundings, and on His side by new manifestations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {c} Vision of His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The crown of this utterance of Christ’s will is ‘that they may behold My glory.’ In an earlier part of this prayer our Lord had spoken of the ‘glory which I had with Thee before the world was.’ But probably the glory ‘given’ is not that of essential Divinity, but that of His mediatorial work. To His people ‘with Him where He is,’ are imparted fuller views of Christ as Saviour, deeper notions of His work, clearer perception of His rule in providence and nature. This is the loftiest employment of the spirits who are perfected and lapped in ‘pleasures for evermore’ by their union with the glorified Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Surely this is grander than all metaphorical pictures of heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The incipient fulfilment now going on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The prayer has been in process of fulfilment ever since. The dead in Christ have entered on its answer now.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We need not discuss difficulties about the ‘intermediate state,’ for this at all events is true, that to be ‘absent from the body’ is to be ‘present with the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A Christian death is an answer to this prayer. True, for Christians as for all, the physical necessity is an imperative law. True, the punitive aspect of death is retained for them. But yet the law is wielded by Christ, and while death remains, its whole aspect is changed. So we may think of those who have departed in His faith and fear as gone in answer to this prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How beautiful that is! Slowly, one by one, they are gathered in, as the stars one by one light up. Place after place is filled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Thus through the ages the prayer works on, and our dear ones have gone from us, but they have gone to Him. We weep, but they rejoice. To us their departure is the result of an iron law, of a penal necessity, of some secondary cause; but to them it is seen to be the answer to His mighty prayer. They hear His voice and follow Him when He says, ‘Come up hither.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The final fulfilment still future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The prayer looks forward to a perfect fulfilment. His prayer cannot be vain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {a} Perfect in degree.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {b} Perfect in extent, when all shall be gathered together and the ‘whole family’ shall be ‘in heaven,’ and Christ’s own word receives its crowning realisation, that ‘of all whom the Father hath given Him He has lost nothing.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And these are not some handful picked out by a decree which we can neither fathom nor alter, but Christ is given to us all, and if we choose to take Him, then for us He has ascended; and as we watch Him going up the voice comes to us: ‘I go to prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto Myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Father, I will </span>— He asks as one having a right to be heard; and prays, not as a servant, but as a Son; <span class="ital">that they also whom thou hast given me — </span>Not only my apostles and first disciples, but all my believing, loving, and obedient people; <span class="ital">may be with me where I am </span>— Namely, in that heavenly world to which I am now removing.

He had declared and would further declare the name or character of God, by his doctrine and his Spirit, that, being one with him, the love of the Father to him might abide with them also. Thus, being joined to Him by one Spirit, they might be filled with all the fulness of God, and enjoy a blessedness of which we can form no right idea in our present state.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will - This expression, though it commonly denotes command, is here only expressive of desire.

Not all the world, but a select number; not apostles only, nor as such; nor believers, or as such, for as such they were not given to Christ; nor as considered in the effectual calling; but as the elect of God, and by that eternal act of his grace; when they were given to Christ as his children, as his spouse, as his church, as the sheep of his hand, as his portion, and to be preserved by him; which is known by their calling and conversion: the form in which these words are delivered, is not so much by way of entreaty, as demand; they are a declaration of Christ's will, in which he insists on it as his right, upon the foot of his purchase, and those covenant transactions which passed between him and his Father, on the behalf of those that were given to him: that they <p>be with me where I am; not where he was then, unless it may be meant of him as the omnipresent God, and as such then in heaven; though he rather designs where he should be as man, after his resurrection, and where the souls of saints are after death; and where they will be, soul and body, when raised again; and which is desirable both to Christ, and to his people; this was the joy that was set before him, and what they comfort one another with, that they shall be for ever with him: <p>that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me; not the simple abstract glory of his deity; which, as it was not given to him, is not to be seen by them; but his glory as Mediator: this was seen, though imperfectly by some, in the days of his flesh; and in the glass of the Gospel, a believer now has some views of it, and by faith sees, knows, and is assured that Christ is glorified in heaven; but hereafter the saints in their own persons, and with their own eyes, shall see him as he is, and appear in glory with him; which sight of his glory will be near, and not at a distance, appropriating and assimilating, rejoicing, satisfying, and for ever: <p>for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world; this is mentioned both as a reason why such a glory was given him, because of his Father's early love to him as Mediator; and as an argument why he might expect to be heard and answered, because of the interest he had in his affections, which had been strongly towards him, even from everlasting; and because the persons he asks, or rather demands these things for, shared in the same ancient love. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>.

It is a prayer, too, which rises from the high and unique term <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span> (one which he never puts into the lips of his disciples) to a yet higher one, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, as one who speaks with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> which God had given him over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to those whom God had given him. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> means less than "I will," and more than "I desire," and is destitute of that element of "counsel" or deliberation that is involved in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Very soon after this, when the full force of his human consciousness pressed upon him, he said (<a href="/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>), "Not what (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>) I will, but what thou wiliest." But here he is so conscious of the Father's will concerning others that he cries, <span class="cmt_word">Father, as for them whom</span> - or, as some ancient codices read, <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">which</span> - <span class="cmt_word">thou hast given me</span>, regarded as a mystic unity, as the Bride which he has redeemed, <span class="cmt_word">I will that they also be with me where I am</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> resolves the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span> into the elements of which it is composed. This is the first part of the final petition, and it embraces everything. "<span class="accented">With</span> Christ;" "Forever with the Lord;" in his glory and part of it, in the place which he is going to localize and prepare for them, is heaven. The glory which he had already given to his disciples (Ver. 22) falls far short of this fellowship with him where his undimmed radiance shines, is only a preparation for sharing with him in his ultimate triumph over the world and death, and also for sitting down with him on his throne (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). In this world fellowship with him in his suffering humanity did not finally reveal the transcendent glory (though in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> the apostle says, "We beheld his glory," etc.) of his Person. To realize this he prays, <span class="cmt_word">And that they may also behold the glory which is mine, which thou hast given me</span>. The glory given cannot be the glory of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, according to Meyer, for that is not given, but belongs to him by eternal right; yet Meyer admits that the Father gave the Son to have life in himself; and that even the eternal Sonship itself may be regarded as the eternal bestowment of an infinite love. Seeing that the Lord goes on to give a reason of his <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> founded on an eternal or at least pre-mundane manifestation of a conscious love, surely he is thinking of the exaltation of humanity into the eternal glory, which he distinctly relinquished and veiled in the days of his flesh. That which they had hitherto seen they only partially apprehended, though he had even given it to them (ver. 22), and though they had been drawn out of the world to high places of transfiguration, that they might behold it and learn how it coexisted with and was compatible with a perfect resignation to the will of God in human redemption. Our Lord prays, nay, <span class="accented">wills</span>, that they should hereafter see it in its fullness of grace and beauty, see it when relieved from obstructive hindrances due to the flesh and to the world, see it on the grandest scale, see it as it really <span class="accented">is</span>, see the full capacity and infinite momentum of the glory which he had already bestowed upon them. <span class="cmt_word">For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span> This, say Meyer and Luthardt, is given as a reason of the prayer for his disciples, not as an explanation of the glory which he had with the Father before the world was. It is often said that the exaltation of the Son of man is a reward for his self-humiliation, and the crown of his sacrificial death (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>), but these very passages couple that exaltation with the premundane glory of him who was, to begin with, and before his work of redemption, the "Effulgence of the Father's glory," who was "in the form of God," and regarded the being equal with God as no <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;</span> as a thing to be seized, prized, and held in its integrity. And in <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>, "<span class="accented">He</span> was by reason of his intended passion crowned with glory and honor, in order that he might taste death for every man." So that the glory which he had with the Father before the world was, and therefore before his incarnation, was that very glory of self-devoting and unutterable love into which he would come again with all the trophies of his redemptive work. The new and higher embodiment of his humanity would prove of such a kind that his essential glory would shine through it in undimmed luster. If this be the meaning, we cannot dilute this pregnant saying, one of the most mysterious of all his words, one which leads us up to the highest possible conception of the relations between the Father and the Son. The eternal love of which the Godhead itself is the SOURCE and the OBJECT is that to which we shall be introduced, and which our Lord would have us see and share (cf. <a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1-3</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They - whom (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>The best texts read &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;, that which.
