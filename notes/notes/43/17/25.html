Notes on <a href="/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you.

This thought follows upon the prayer that those whom the Father had given Him may be where He is, and behold the divine glory; and the connection seems to be in the thought that sinful humanity cannot see God and live. The world, indeed, knew not God (comp. <a href="/john/15-21.htm" title="But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.">John 15:21</a>; <a href="/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a>), but the Son knew God, and the disciples had recognised that He had been sent by God, and in their knowledge of Him had passed through a moral’ change, by which they were no longer of the world, but were sons of God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/john/17.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>John<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE HIGH PRIEST’S PRAYER<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a> - <a href="/john/17-26.htm" title="And I have declared to them your name, and will declare it: that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.">John 17:26</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The remainder of this prayer reaches out to all generations of believers to the end. We may incidentally note that it shows that Jesus did not anticipate a speedy end of the history of the world or the Church; and also that it breathes but one desire, that for the Church’s unity, as though He saw what would be its greatest peril. Characteristic, too, of the idealism of this Gospel is it that there is no name for that future community. It is not called ‘church,’ or ‘congregation,’ or the like-it is ‘them also that believe on Me through their word,’ a great spiritual community, held together by common faith in Him whom the Apostles preached. Is not that still the best definition of Christians, and does not such a conception of it correspond better to its true nature than the formal abstraction, ‘the Church’?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We can but touch in the most inadequate fashion the profound words of this section of the prayer which would take volumes to expound fitly. We note that it contains four periods, in each of which something is asked or stated, and then a purpose to be attained by the petition or statement is set forth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> First comes the prayer for unity and what the answer to it will effect {<a href="/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>}. Now in this verse the unity of believers is principally regarded as resulting from the inclusion, if we may so say, of them all in the ineffable union of the Father and the Son. Jesus prays that ‘they may all be one,’ and also ‘that they also may be in us’ {Rev. Ver.}. And their unity is no mere matter of formal external organisation nor of unanimity of creed, or the like, but it is a deep, vital unity. The pattern of it is the unity of the Father and the Son, and the power that brings it about is the abiding of all believers ‘in us.’ The result of such a manifestation in the world of a multitude of men, in all of whom one life evidently moves, fusing their individualities while retaining their personalities, will be the world’s conviction of the divine mission of Jesus. The world was beginning to feel its convictions moving slowly in that direction, when it exclaimed: ‘Behold how these Christians love one another!’ The alienation of Christians has given barbs and feathers to its arrows of scorn. But it is ‘the unity of the Spirit,’ not that of a, great corporation, that Christ’s prayer desires.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The petitions for what would be given to believers passes for a moment into a statement of what Jesus had already given to them. He had begun the unifying gift, and that made a plea for its perfecting. The ‘glory’ which He had given to these poor bewildered Galilaeans was but in a rudimentary stage; but still, wherever there is faith in Him, there is some communication of His life and Spirit, and some of that veiled and yet radiant glory, ‘full of grace and truth,’ which shone through the covering when the Incarnate Word ‘became flesh.’ It is the Christ-given Christ-likeness in each which knits believers into one. It is Christ in us and we in Christ that fuses us into one, and thereby makes each perfect. And such flashing back of the light of Jesus from a million separate crystals, all glowing with one light and made one in the light, would flash on darkest eyes the lustre of the conviction that God sent Christ, and that God’s love enfolded those Christlike souls even as it enfolded Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Again {<a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>} comes a petition with its result. And here there is no mention of the effect of the answer on the world. For the moment the thoughts of isolation in, and a message to, the world fade away. The partially-possessed ‘glory’ seems to have led on Christ’s thoughts to the calm home of perfection waiting for Him who was ‘not of the world’ and was sent into it, and for the humble ones who had taken Him for Lord. ‘I will that’-that is a strange tone for a prayer. What consciousness on Christ’s part does it involve? The disciples are not now called ‘them that should believe on Me,’ but ‘that which Thou hast given Me,’ the individuals melt into the great whole. They are Christ’s, not merely by their faith or man’s preaching, but by the Father’s gift. And the fact of that gift is used as a plea with Him, to ‘perfect that which concerneth’ them, and to complete the unity of believers with Jesus by bringing them to be ‘with Him’ in His triumphant session at the right hand. To ‘behold’ will be the same as to share His glory, not only that which we beheld when He tabernacled among us, but that which He had in the pouring out on Him of God’s love ‘before the foundation of the world.’ Our dim eyes cannot follow the happy souls as they are lost in the blaze, but we know that they walk in light and are like Him, for they ‘see Him as He is.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The last statement {<a href="/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a> - <a href="/john/17-26.htm" title="And I have declared to them your name, and will declare it: that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.">John 17:26</a>} is not petition but vow, and, to our ears, promise. The contrast of the world and believers appears for the last time. What made the world a ‘world’ was its not knowing God; what made believers isolated in, and having an errand to, the world, was that they ‘knew’ {not merely ‘believed,’ but knew by experience} that Jesus had been sent from God to make known His name. All our knowledge of God comes through Him; it is for us to recognise His divine mission, and then He will unveil, more and more, with blessed continuity of increasing knowledge, the Name, and with growing knowledge of it growing measures of God’s love will be in us, and Jesus Himself will ‘dwell in our hearts by faith’ more completely and more blessedly through an eternity of wider knowledge and more fervent love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me....">John 17:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">O righteous Father </span>— Faithful and just, as well as merciful.

He had declared and would further declare the name or character of God, by his doctrine and his Spirit, that, being one with him, the love of the Father to him might abide with them also.

God is righteous in all the divine persons: the Father is righteous, the Son is righteous, and the Holy Spirit is righteous: he is so in his nature; righteousness is a perfection of it; he is so in all his purposes and promises; in all his ways and works of providence and grace; in predestination, redemption, justification, pardon of sin, and eternal glory. Christ makes use of this epithet, as containing a reason why he might justly expect that all his petitions and claims, on behalf of himself and people, would be regarded: <p>the world hath not known thee; the unbelieving Jews, and idolatrous Gentiles, wicked men, one or another, know not God: as not the Father, so neither the Son, nor Spirit; though deity may be known by them, or that there is a God, yet they know not God in Christ, nor as the Father of Christ, or as their Father in him, nor what it is to have communion with him; nor do they know any of the things of God in a spiritual way; which shows the darkness and blindness of men by nature, the necessity of a divine illumination, and the miserable state of men without one: <p>but I have known thee; his nature, perfections and glory, his secret thoughts, purposes and designs, his covenant, promises and blessings, his love, grace and good will to his people, his whole mind and will; as he needs must, since he was one with him, and lay in his bosom; <p>and these have known that thou hast sent me; meaning his disciples and apostles, whom he distinguishes from the world; these knew the Father that sent him, and that he was sent by the Father; they knew the love of the Father in sending of him, the manner in which he was sent, and the end, man's redemption, for which he was sent; and acknowledged all this, and which laid them under an obligation to trust in him, love him, and magnify his grace; and is used by Christ as an argument with the Father to be concerned for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me....">John 17:25-26</a>. Conclusion of the prayer: Appeal to the <span class="ital">justice</span> of God, for, after that which Jesus here states of Himself and of the disciples in opposition to the world, it becomes the righteous Father not to leave ungranted what Jesus has just declared, <a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>, to be His will (<span class="greekheb">θέλω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.). Otherwise the final recompense would fail to come, which the divine <span class="ital">justice</span> (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>) has to give to those who are so raised, as expressed in <a href="/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a>, above the world; the work of divine <span class="ital">holiness</span>, <a href="/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you.

Vulg. <span class="ital">et al.</span>, is to be explained, is not removed by placing, with Grotius and Lachmann, only a comma after <a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>, and allowing <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ κόσμος σε οὐκ ἔγνω</span> to run with what precedes, since this thought does not fit into this logical connection, and the address <span class="greekheb">πάτερ δίκαιε</span>, according to the analogy of <a href="/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.">John 17:11</a>, leads us to recognise the <span class="ital">introductory</span> sentence of a prayer. According to Bengel and Ebrard, <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, <span class="ital">et … et</span>, correspond to one another, which, however, does not allow either of the antithetic character of the conceptions, or of the manifest reference of the second <span class="greekheb">καί</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ δέ</span>. Following Heumann, De Wette, Lücke, Tholuck make <span class="greekheb">καί</span> correspond to the following <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, so that two relations <span class="ital">occurring at the same time</span>, but of <span class="ital">opposite</span>, kinds,[204] would be indicated: “whilst the world knew Thee not, yet I knew Thee.” Not to be justified on grammatical grounds; for <span class="greekheb">τέ</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> (Kühner, II. p. 418; Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. I. p. 92 f.; Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar</span>. p. 741 f.), but never <span class="greekheb">καί</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, is thus employed, and the passages of that kind adduced by Lücke from Plato, <span class="ital">Menex</span>. p. 235 E (where <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἄλλους</span> means <span class="ital">also</span> others), and <span class="ital">Eryx</span>. p. 393 E (where <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐλάχιστα</span> is <span class="ital">only even</span> the least), are not in point; in other passages (as Soph. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. 428) <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is the simply connective <span class="ital">and</span>, without reference to the subsequent <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> in the present passage is rather the <span class="ital">and</span> serving to link on an <span class="ital">antithetic</span> relation (<span class="ital">and notwithstanding</span>), and is of very frequent occurrence, particularly in John, see on <a href="/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>. Had Jesus said: <span class="greekheb">πάτερ</span>, <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος εἶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ κόσμος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., then <span class="greekheb">καί</span> would have been free from any difficulty. Nevertheless, the connection and its expression is the same. Christ is, in the address <span class="greekheb">πάτερ δίκαιε</span>, absorbed in the thought of the <span class="ital">justice</span> of God now invoked by Him, the thought, therefore, of this self-revelation of God, which was so easily to be recognised (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a> ff.), in spite of which the world, in its blinded security, has not known Him (comp. <a href="/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>), and gives expression to this latter thought in painfully excited emotion (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">δυσχεραίνων</span>), immediately connecting it by <span class="greekheb">καί</span> with the address. After <span class="greekheb">πάτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δίκαιε</span> we may suppose a pause, a break in the thought: <span class="ital">Righteous Father</span>—(yea, such Thou art!) <span class="ital">and</span> (and yet) <span class="ital">the world knew Thee not!</span>[205] Luthardt also, with Brückner’s concurrence, takes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> as <span class="ital">and yet</span>, but so that it stands in opposition to the revelation of God through Christ previously (see <a href="/john/17-22.htm" title="And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:">John 17:22</a>) stated.

So rich in promise and elevating with the simply grand “<span class="ital">and I in them</span>,” resounds the word of prayer, and in the whole ministry and experience of the apostles was it fulfilled. As nothing could separate them from the love of God in Christ (<a href="/romans/8-39.htm" title="Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.">Romans 8:39</a>), Christ thus remained in them through the Spirit, and they have conquered far and wide through Him who loved them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[204] Hence also the reading: <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ ὁ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., which is found not merely in Hippolytus, but also in the <span class="ital">Constitt.

But Ewald places <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ κόσμος</span> to <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσω</span>, ver. 26, in a parenthesis, and then takes <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἡ ἀγάπη</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., still as the contents of <span class="greekheb">θέλε</span>, ver. 24. How broken thus becomes the calm, clear flow of the prayer! According to Baeumlein, the parallel clauses would properly be <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγὼ σὲ ἔγνων καὶ οὕτοι ἔγνωσαν</span>; but there is interpolated before the first clause an opposite clause, which properly should have <span class="greekheb">μέν</span>, so that then the main thought follows with <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>. Alike arbitrary, but yet more contorted, is the arrangement of Godet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[206] Comp. <a href="/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>. Bengel aptly remarks: “<span class="ital">ut cor ipsorum theatrum sit et palaestra hujus amoris</span>,” namely, <span class="greekheb">διὰ πνεύματος ἁγίου</span>, Rom. <span class="ital">l.c.</span> According to Hengstenberg (comp. also Weiss, p. 80), Jesus merely intends to say: “that Thou mayest love them with the love with which Thou hast loved me.” But this does not suit the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτοῖς ᾖ</span>, neither in itself nor in the parallel relation to <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτοῖς</span>. An inward efficacious presence must be thereby intended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>NOTE.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">originality</span> of the high-priestly prayer stands upon the same footing with that of the longer discourses of Jesus generally in the Evangelist John. The substance of the contents is original, but the reproduction and vivid remodelling, such as could not come forth from the Johannean individuality, with which the recollection had grown up, otherwise than with quite a Johannean stamp. Along with this, however, in reference to contents and form, considering the peculiarly profound impression which the prayer of this solemn moment must necessarily have made upon the spirit and memory of that very disciple, a superior degree of fidelity of recollection and power of reddition must be assumed. How often may these last solemn words have stirred the soul of John! To this corresponds also the self-consciousness, as childlike as it is simple and clear in its elevation, the victorious rest and peace of this prayer, which is the noblest and purest pearl of devotion in the whole of the N. T. “For so plainly and simply it sounds, so deep, rich, and wide it is, that none can fathom it,” Luther. Spener never ventured to preach upon it, because he felt that its true understanding exceeded the ordinary measure of faith; but he caused it to be read to him three times on the evening before his death, see his <span class="ital">Lebensbeschr</span>. by Canstein, p. 145 ff. The contrary view, that it is a later idealizing fiction of a dogmatic and metaphysical kind (Bretschneider, Strauss, Weisse, Baur, Scholten), is indeed a necessary link in the chain of controversy on the originality of the Johannean history generally, but all the more untenable, the more unattainable, the depth, tenderness, intensity, and loftiness, as is here sustained from beginning to end, must have been for a later inventor. But to deny the inward truth and splendour of the prayer (see especially Weisse, II. p. 294), is a matter evincing a critically corrupt taste and judgment. The <span class="ital">conflict of soul in Gethsemane</span>, so soon after this prayer which speaks of overcoming the world and of peace, is indeed, considering the pure humanity of Jesus (which was not forced into stoical indifference), psychologically too conceivable, not, indeed, as a voluntarily assumed representation of all the horrors of death from the sin of the world (Hengstenberg), but rather from the change of feelings and dispositions in the contemplation of death, and of <span class="ital">such</span> a death, to be made to pass as an historical contradiction to chap. 17 See on Matt., note after <a href="/matthew/26-46.htm" title="Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that does betray me.">Matthew 26:46</a>. John himself relates nothing of the crisis of the conflict of soul; but this is connected with his peculiarity in the selection of the evangelical material in general, and he might be determined in this matter particularly by the account already given of the similar fact, <a href="/john/12-23.htm" title="And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.">John 12:23</a> ff., which <span class="ital">he only</span> adduces, whilst that conflict of soul was already a common property of Scriptural tradition (comp. also <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>), which he as little needed to repeat as the institution of the Lord’s Supper and many other things. That that conflict of soul had not for John the importance and historic reality which it had for the Synoptics, is considering the free selection which he has made out of the rich material of his recollection, a hasty conclusion (in answer to Baur, in the <span class="ital">Theol. Jahrb</span>. 1854, p. 224). The historic reality of the Gospel facts, if nothing essential is otherwise opposed to them, is not affected by the silence of John.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πάτερ δίκαιε</span>, “Righteous Father”. The appeal is now to God’s justice; “ut tua bonitas me miserat servandsn si qua fieri potuisset, omnibus; ita tui, justitia non patietur ob quorundam iacredulitatem frustrari vota credentium”. Erasmus. The Father’s justice is appealed to, that the believing may not share the fate of the unbelieving world <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ κόσμος</span> Elsner translates “quamvis,” and Lampe says all difficulty thus disappears. But Elsner’s examples are irrelevant. Meyer renders “Righteous Father—(yea, such Thou art!) and (and yet) the world knew Thee not.” Simcox suggests that the first <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is correlative not to the immediately following <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, but to the second <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, the effect being something like: “While the world knew Thee not, though I knew Thee, these on their part knew”.… Similarly Westcott; “it serves to coordinate the two main clauses.… The force of it is as if we were to say: Two facts are equally true; it is true that the world knew Thee not; it is true that these knew that Thou didst send me.” May the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> not be intended to connect this clause with the preceding <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">κόσμου</span>, and to mark the contrast between the love that was in God before the foundation of the world and the world’s ignorance of Him, and especially of His love? But “I knew Thee and these knew,” etc. They did not know God directly as Christ did, but they knew they could accept Him as the Revealer of God. And to them who were willing to receive my message, because they knew I was sent by Thee, I made known Thy name and will make it known by my death (Weiss) and by sending the Spirit of truth (Westcott). The end in view in this manifestation by Christ was that the love with which the Father had loved the Son might rest on the disciples. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἡ ἀγάπη ἣν ἠγάπησάς με</span>. The construction is found in <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm" title="But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,">Ephesians 2:4</a>, and is frequent in the classics; <span class="greekheb">ἡ κρίσις ἣν ἐκρίθη</span>, Lysias; <span class="greekheb">τῇ νίκῃ ἣν ἐνίκησε</span>, Arrian.—See Kypke. <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτοῖς</span>. This is the end and crown of all. That He should desire this intimate communion with men, and should seek above all else to live in and through His disciples, is surprising proof of His love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25, 26</span>.

The world knew not God; Christ knew Him; the disciples knew that Christ was sent by Him. ‘Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath not known</span>] Better, <span class="bld">knew</span> <span class="ital">not</span>.

Vers. 1, 5, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> simply; Ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>; Ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> without any characterization). The righteousness of God is a more exalted perfection than his holiness, one that might seem more at variance with the exercise of his paternal compassion; yet this righteousness is conspicuously displayed in the redemptive love which Christ had thus manifested, and the beloved disciple (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>) declares that God is faithful and "righteous" in forgiving the repentant sinner. The blending of the idea of righteousness with Fatherhood is the sublime revelation made by the Lord Jesus, and he gathers the two ideas together into an indissoluble unity. Justice and mercy are seen by the whole work of the Son of God to have been the outflow and effulgence of the one all-comprehending and infinite love. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> that here follows has created some difficulty, though some manuscripts emit it (D and Vulgate), probably in consequence of its inappropriateness; but it is received on strong ancient authority. Meyer and Hengstenberg take it thus: <span class="accented">Righteous Father</span> (<span class="accented">yea</span>, <span class="accented">such thou art</span>), <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">yet</span>) <span class="accented">the world knew thee not</span>. But would our Lord have hesitated, as it were, to express this truth, without justifying it against the unbelief of the world? Moulton tries to explain the simple adversative force of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by "both the world learned not to know thee, but I learned to know thee." Godet has expressed the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> more effectively by  translating, <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">world</span>, <span class="accented">it is true</span>, <span class="accented">knew thee not</span>, <span class="accented">but I knew thee</span>. The Revised Version has, with the Authorized Version, simply omitted the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>. It is one of the most solemn of the Lord's condemnations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Apostle Paul said (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>), "The world through its wisdom knew not God;" and in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-23</a> he shows that this ignorance was willful and practical and without excuse. The history of the struggling of the world after God has shown how dense the human darkness is. There have been signs that men groped after the idea of a Father who should be blind to their faults and indifferent to their follies, and utter a righteous Lord who has exalted righteousness and hated iniquity; but it was left for Christ to blend these apparently discordant beams into the radiance of a perfect glory. How many illustrations do the sad and shameless perversions of human intelligence supply! <span class="cmt_word">But I knew thee</span>, because of the eternity of that ineffable love wherewith thou hast loved me, and because of the depth of that righteous love which thou hast manifested to the world in sending me upon my mission. <span class="cmt_word">And these knew</span> - came to know by personal intuition - <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me</span> (cf. <a href="/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>, and Vers. 8, 23) on the mission of redeeming the world. They have learned that I have come with all thy authority and in all thy power; that I have come out from thee; that I entered into the world; that I have glorified thee among men; that my thoughts are thy thoughts, and my "words" (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) are thy (Logos) "Word;" that my works of love are the works of the Father; and that my promises are the manifestation of thy Name to the men whom thou hast given me. </body></html>
