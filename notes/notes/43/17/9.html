and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from you, and they have believed that you did send me.">John 17:8</a>). “I who am about to leave the world;” “they who will remain in the world” (<a href="/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.">John 17:11</a>). The tense is the strict present, referring to the prayer which He is at this moment uttering, and not to His general practice, which the Authorised version may be taken to express. Against any limitation of the prayer of our Lord, see <a href="/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>, and His own prayer for His enemies, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>). Comp. also His command to His disciples to pray for “them which despitefully used them” (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>). The present prayer was like that which pious Rabbis were accustomed to offer for their pupils. (Comp. Schöttgen’s Note here.) It is from its very nature applicable only to disciples. He is leaving them, and commends them to His Father’s care.<p><span class= "bld">But for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</span>—This is the special claim on which He commends them to the Father. They were the Father’s before they were given to the Son. By that gift they have become the Father’s more fully (<a href="/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>).

These only he prays for here, as appears from <a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>, where he says, he had kept all the persons he was praying for in the faith and practice of true religion, except the son of perdition; and from <a href="/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>, where he says, he had commissioned them to go forth into the world for the same purpose that the Father had sent him; and from <a href="/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a>, where he expressly distinguishes them from all other believers whatever. <span class="ital">I pray not for the world </span>— Not in these petitions, which are adapted to the state of believers only. But this no more proves that our Lord did not pray for the <span class="ital">world, </span>both before and afterward, than his praying for the apostles only in these verses proves that he did not pray for <span class="ital">them also who should believe in him through their word, </span><a href="/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a>. <span class="ital">But for them which thou hast given me, </span>&c. — See on verse; <span class="ital">for they are thine </span>— The reason thus assigned for making them the subject of his prayers at this time is remarkable. It is as if he had said, “I employ the last moments of my life in praying particularly for my apostles, because their are more especially thy servants, destined for that work which is the great object of thy attention, the instruction and salvation of the world.” <span class="ital">All mine are thine </span>— All my servants are thy servants; that is, whosoever assists me in my work, serves thee in thy great designs of love and mercy to men. <span class="ital">And thine are mine </span>— Thy servants are my servants; every one who really serves thee must join issue with me, and assist me in my work. <span class="ital">And I am glorified in them </span>— By the zeal, faithfulness, and success of my servants in converting the world, I am greatly honoured. This, however, is not our Lord’s only meaning in this clause; the original words being <span class="greekheb">τα εμα παντα σα εστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">και τα σα εμα</span>, not, <span class="ital">all my servants are thy servants, </span>&c., but, <span class="ital">all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine; </span>expressions too grand for any mere creature to use; as implying, that all things whatsoever, inclusive of the divine nature, perfections, and operations, are the common property of the Father and the Son. And this is the original ground of that peculiar property which both the Father and the Son have, in the persons who were given to Christ as Mediator, according to what is said in the close of the verse of his being glorified by them; namely, by their believing in him, and so acknowledging his glory.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:6-10. Christ prays for those that are his. Thou gavest them me, as sheep to the shepherd, to be kept; as a patient to the physician, to be cured; as children to a tutor, to be taught: thus he will deliver up his charge. It is a great satisfaction to us, in our reliance upon Christ, that he, all he is and has, and all he said and did, all he is doing and will do, are of God. Christ offered this prayer for his people alone as believers; not for the world at large. Yet no one who desires to come to the Father, and is conscious that he is unworthy to come in his own name, need be discouraged by the Saviour's declaration, for he is both able and willing to save to the uttermost, all that come unto God by him. Earnest convictions and desires, are hopeful tokens of a work already wrought in a man; they begin to evidence that he has been chosen unto salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. They are thine; wilt thou not provide for thine own? Wilt thou not secure them? Observe the foundation on which this plea is grounded, All mine are thine, and thine are mine. This speaks the Father and Son to be one. All mine are thine. The Son owns none for his, that are not devoted to the service of the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I pray for them - In view of their dangers and trials, he sought the protection and blessing of God on them. His prayer was always answered.<p>Not for the world - The term world here, as elsewhere, refers to wicked, rebellious, vicious men. The meaning of this expression here seems to be this: Jesus is praying for his disciples. As a reason why God should bless them, he says that they were not of the world; that they had been taken out of the world; that they belonged unto God. The petition was not offered for wicked, perverse, rebellious men, but for those who were the friends of God and were disposed to receive his favors. This passage, then, settles nothing about the question whether Christ prayed for sinners. He then prayed for his disciples, who were not those who hated him and disregarded his favors. He afterward extended the prayer for all who should become Christians, <a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20</a>. When on the cross he prayed for his crucifiers and murderers, <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>.<p>For they are thine - This is urged as a reason why God should protect and guide them. His honor was concerned in keeping them; and we may always "fill our mouths with" such "arguments" when we come before God, and plead that his honor will be advanced by keeping us from evil, and granting us all needful grace.<p>I am glorified in them - I am honored by their preaching and lives. The sense of this passage is, "Those who are my disciples are thine. That which promotes my honor will also promote thine. I pray, therefore, that they may have needful grace to honor my gospel, and to proclaim it among men." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-14.

But to teach us to distinguish in our prayer, our Saviour here distinguishes, and prays for some things for his chosen ones, which he doth not pray for on the behalf of others: these he describes to be such as his Father (whose they were) had given him, either by an eternal donation, or by working faith in them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I pray for them,.... This is to be understood of Christ, not as God; for as such he is the object of prayer; nor need he pray to any other; nor is there any superior to him under that consideration to pray unto; but as man and Mediator: nor is his praying any argument against his deity; nor proof of inferiority to his Father with respect to his divine nature; since it is not in that, but in his human, nature, that he prayed; though this may be ascribed to his whole person as Godman; hence he had the greatest qualifications and abilities for this work, and his prayers were always heard: praying, as attributed to Christ, must be restrained to his state of humiliation; prayer is never spoken of Christ but whilst he was here on earth; his intercession in heaven is never expressed by prayer; and the saints when they come thither, will have done praying, Christ whilst on earth, was an excellent pattern of prayer; of private and solitary prayer; of social prayer; for and with his disciples; of frequent and fervent prayer; of submission to the will of God in prayer; and of praying even for enemies: the persons he is here said to pray for are his apostles; which shows their danger and their wants, his care over them, and concern for them, and his love unto them: <p>I pray not for the world; the inhabitants of it, the carnal unbelieving part of the world, which lie in sin, and will be condemned; as he died not for them, so he prayed not for them; for whom he is the propitiation, he is an advocate; and for whom he died, he makes intercession; and for no other in a spiritual saving way: <p>but for them which thou hast given me; out of the world, as distinct from them, to be saved with an everlasting salvation by him; and to be preserved safe to his kingdom and glory; for these he prays, for the conversion of them, the application of pardon to them, their final perseverance and eternal glory: <p>for they are thine; not merely by creation, and as the care of his providence, but by eternal election, and special grace in calling; which is a reason why Christ prayed for them, and an argument why the Father should, and would regard his prayers. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/17-9.htm" title="I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.">John 17:9</a>. <span class="ital">I</span> pray <span class="ital">for them!</span> Both in <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> and in <span class="greekheb">περὶ αὐτῶν</span> there lies a <span class="ital">motive</span> element in reference to God.

Prayer for the unbelieving has been enjoined by Jesus Himself (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>), and was, moreover, offered by Himself upon the cross (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.

We must remember that this is perfectly consistent with the fact that, in the day of the spiritual manifestation to the disciples, when both the Father and Son came to them, the disciples would ask the Father for the gifts which his love to them was waiting to supply; and he, Christ himself, would hear them if they asked in his Name; and that then there would be no need that he should pray the Father for them. That time had not yet come, though it was coming. Both statements are also perfectly consistent with his "intercession" for us. <span class="cmt_word">Not concerning</span> - or, <span class="accented">not for - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the world am I praying</span>. Surely this is not an assertion that he would never pray, or that he had not already prayed, for the world. Nay, his entire ministry is the expression of the Father's love to the whole world (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). He came as Jehovah's Lamb to take away its sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), he bade his disciples (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>) pray for their enemies, and he cried at the last for a blessing on his murderers. He "came to seek and save the lost," to "<span class="accented">call</span> sinners to repentance," "<span class="accented">not</span> to condemn, but to save the world." Moreover, in this prayer (Ver. 21) he <span class="accented">does</span> pray for those who should ultimately, though they do not now, believe on him through the word of the disciples; therefore it is inconceivable that he should here dogmatically limit the range of his gracious desire. Calvin here observes, "We are commanded to pray for all (l Timothy 2:1)," and quotes <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a> that Christ prayed for his murderers. "<span class="accented">We</span> ought to pray that this man and that man and every man may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we cannot distinguish the elect from the reprobate." Calvin implies that Christ is here within the sanctuary, and places before his eyes the secret judgments of the Father. Lampe goes much further. Luther <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">In</span> the same sense in which he prays for the disciples, he does not pray for the world." But the best explanation is that the high-priestly intercession at this supreme moment is concerned with those who were already given to him, and who have come to believe in his Divine Person and commission. He expressly and divinely commends to the Father <span class="cmt_word">those whom thou hast given</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span> - the burden of the thought is contained in the motive he suggests for this commendation, viz. - <span class="cmt_word">because they are thine</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though thou hast given them to me, though they have "come to <span class="accented">me</span>," through thy drawing, they are more than ever "thine." This most fervent yielding to the attraction of Jesus, and utter moral surrender to his control, do not alienate the heart from the Father, but make it more than ever his. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I pray (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;)<p>More strictly, I make request.
