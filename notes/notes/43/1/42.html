Whatever communion there is between our souls and Christ, it is he who begins the discourse. He asked, What seek ye? The question Jesus put to them, we should all put to ourselves when we begin to follow Him, What do we design and desire? In following Christ, do we seek the favour of God and eternal life? He invites them to come without delay. Now is the accepted time, 2Co 6:2. It is good for us to be where Christ is, wherever it be. We ought to labour for the spiritual welfare of those related to us, and seek to bring them to Him. Those who come to Christ, must come with a fixed resolution to be firm and constant to him, like a stone, solid and stedfast; and it is by his grace that they are so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cephas - This is a Syriac word, meaning the same as the Greek word Peter, a stone.

The stone, or rock, is a symbol of firmness and steadiness of character - a trait in Peter's character after the ascension of Jesus that was very remarkable. before the death of Jesus he was rash, headlong, variable; and it is one proof of the omniscience of Jesus that he saw that Peter "would" possess a character that would be expressed appropriately by the word "stone" or "rock." The word "Jonas" is a Hebrew word, whose original signification is a "dove." It may be that Jesus had respect to that when he gave Simon the name Peter.

Cephas is a Syriac word, Peter a Greek word: Christ gave him the name. Both Cephas and Peter are by interpretation, a stone. Beza thinks that our Saviour did not here give him that name, but foretell that he should be so called. Casaubon thinks that the name was here given to him, and with it a new spirit; that whereas before he was (according to his father’s name Jonas, which signifies a dove) fearful and timorous, from this time forward he was as a rock, steady, firm, and full of courage and constancy: but it is a greater question how this text is to be reconciled with <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers....">Matthew 4:18-20</a></span>, where Andrew and Peter are both said to be espied by Christ, <span class="ital">walking by the sea of Galilee; </span> and <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/5-10.htm" title="And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.

Doubtless the calls were different. This in John seems rather to be a prophecy than a call. Those texts, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers....">Matthew 4:18-20</a></span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/5-10.htm" title="And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.

That is, Andrew brought his brother Simon to Jesus; he persuaded him to go along with him, and showed him where he was; which discovered great zeal for Christ, being desirous of, gaining souls unto him; and great affection to his brother, being heartily concerned that he might know Christ, as well as he; nor did he choose that he should take up with the bare account that he gave of him, but would have him go to him himself, that he might be personally acquainted with him, and instructed by him: and this also shows the readiness and willingness of Simon, to see and hear Christ himself, and not sit down contented with the bare relation his brother gave: no doubt he found his heart stirred up within him, and the desires of his soul going after Christ; and therefore he at once rose up and went with Andrew to him; and thus one person may be the means of bringing another to Christ: and it may be observed, that Peter was not the first of the apostles that was called by Christ, or first knew him; Andrew was before him, and the means of bringing him into an acquaintance with him; had it been the reverse, the Papists would have improved it in favour of Peter, as the prince of the apostles: this clause is omitted in the Persic version, <p>And when Jesus beheld him; as he was coming, or come to him: he had beheld him before in the glass of his Father's purposes and decrees; he had viewed him in his blood, and said unto him, live; and he now looked upon him with a look of love, of complacency, and delight: <p>he said, thou art Simon, the son of Jona; thy name is Simon, and thy father's name is Jona: he knew both their names, though he might have never seen their faces, nor heard of them: this he said to give Simon a testimony of his omniscience; and which, no doubt, must strike him at once. Simon, or Simeon, was a common name among the Jews, being the name of one of the twelve patriarchs;  see Gill on <a href="/matthew/10-2.htm">Matthew 10:2</a>; and so likewise was Jona, being the name of a prophet of theirs; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; and inasmuch as the prophet Jonah was of Gathhepher in Zebulun, which was in Galilee;  see Gill on <a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>; this might be a common name among the Galilaeans; so that there seems no reason why it should be thought to be the same with John, as the Ethiopic version reads it, and by way of interrogation, "art thou not Simon the son of John?" <p>Thou shall be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a stone; or Peter as it should rather be rendered; and as it is in the Vulgate Latin, and Ethiopic versions; and as "Cepha", or "Cephas", in the Syriac and Chaldee languages signifies a stone, or rock (k), so does "Peter" in Greek: hence, the Syriac version here gives no interpretation of the word. Christ not only calls Simon by his present name, at first sight of him, but tells him what his future name should be; and which imports, not only that he should be a lively stone in the spiritual building, the church, but should have a considerable hand in that work, and abide firm and steadfast to Christ, and his interest, notwithstanding his fall; and continue constant and immoveable until death, as he did.

The result of their conversation with Jesus is summed up in these words. They were now convinced that He was the Christ. In Jewish lips “we have found the Messiah” was the most comprehensive of all Eurekas.

Seeing that Simon was found so soon - most probably on the evening of the memorable day - we gather that Simon also must have been among the hearers of John. He too must have left his fishing to listen to the Baptist. The entire group must have been drawn away from their ordinary avocations by the trumpet call of the preacher in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus looked</span> - intently, with penetrating glance - <span class="cmt_word">upon him, and said, Thou art Simon, the Son of</span> <span class="cmt_word">John</span>  - that is the name by which thou hast been introduced to me; a time is coming for thee to receive a new name - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called</span> <span class="cmt_word">Cephas</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which is interpreted, Peter</span>). It is perfectly gratuitous of Baur and Hilgenfeld to imagine this to be a fictitious adaptation of the great scene recorded in <a href="/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16</a>. The solemn assertions made there proceed upon the assumption of the previous conference of the <span class="accented">name</span> "Peter." There the Lord said, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock," etc. On this earlier occasion Jesus said, "Thou art Simon, thou shalt be called <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>." The assumption of the Tubingen critics, that a desire to lower Peter from his primacy is conspicuous in this passage, cannot be sustained. Though Andrew and John precede Peter in their earliest relations with Jesus, yet Peter is undoubtedly the most conspicuous character, to whom the Lord from the first gives an honourable cognomen (cf. also <a href="/john/6-67.htm">John 6:67-69</a> and John 21:15, etc.). (Compare here, for historic changes of name, <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>.) Weiss ('Life of Christ,' Eng. trans., 1:370) says admirably, "There is no ground for assuming that this is an anticipation of <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>. Simon was not to bear this name until he was deserving of it. Jesus never called him anything but Simon (<a href="/mark/14-37.htm">Mark 14:37</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-25.htm">Matthew 17:25</a>; <a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). Paul calls him by the names Peter and Cephas.... The evangelist is right when he beholds in this scene a more than human acumen.  ... The history shows he was not deceived in Peter." This narrative cannot be a Johannine setting forth of the first call of the four disciples as given in the synoptists. If it be, it is a fictitious modification. Place, occasion, and immediate result are all profoundly different. The one narrative cannot be twisted into the other. Are the anti-harmonists correct in saying that they are irreconcilable? Certainly not. There is no indication that before John was cast into prison, before Jesus commenced his public ministry in Galilee, he had called disciples away from their ordinary duties to be his apostles. Some of these four may have returned, as Jesus himself did, to his family and domestic surroundings (<a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>). John may have accompanied Jesus to Jerusalem and through Samaria. But there is much to make it probable that Simon, Andrew, and at least, were, during the whole of that period, on the lake pondering the future.
