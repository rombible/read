He is coming, when the look directed towards others rests also upon him. It finds the character which it tests earnest and honest. What gave rise to the form in which this is expressed is not stated. There is clearly some unexpressed link with the history of Jacob. The word for “guile” is the same word as the LXX. word for “subtlety” in <a href="/genesis/27-35.htm" title="And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.">Genesis 27:35</a>. The thought then is, “Behold one who is true to the name of Israel, and in whom there is nothing of the Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-36.htm" title="And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?">Genesis 27:36</a>). There is something in the words which comes as a revelation to Nathanael. Were they a proof that the Presence before whom he stood read to the very depths of his own thought? Under the shade of a tree, where Jews were accustomed to retire for meditation and prayer, had the Old Testament history of Jacob been present to his mind? Was he too “left alone,” and did he “prevail with God?” And does he now hear the inmost thought expressed in words, carrying certainty to his soul, and giving him too the victory of seeing God “face to face with life preserved?” (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm" title="And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.">Genesis 32:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/1-47.htm" title="Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!...">John 1:47-51</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus saw Nathanael coming — </span>“Nathanael, being a man of a candid disposition, resolved to go and converse with Jesus, that he might judge with the more certainty concerning his pretensions. He was coming therefore with Philip on this errand, when Jesus, who knew his thoughts, honoured him with the amiable character of a <span class="ital">true Israelite, in whom there was no guile </span>— A plain, upright, honest man, one free from hypocrisy, and open to conviction; one who not only derived his pedigree from Abraham, but who inherited his virtues.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Nathanael saith, Whence knowest thou me </span>— I am a perfect stranger to thee; how then canst thou know my character? <span class="ital">Jesus answered </span>— I am not so entire a stranger to thy character as thou art ready to suppose; nor do I take it from uncertain report. <span class="ital">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast </span>alone <span class="ital">under the fig- tree, I saw thee </span>— As if he had said, I was present in spirit to observe what passed in that secret retirement. I know how well thou deservest the testimony which I have now borne to thine integrity. <span class="ital">Nathanael </span>was so struck with this express reference to what he was certain none could know but God and his own conscience, that all his prejudices were at once removed; and he immediately replied, <span class="ital">Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, </span>&c. — So he acknowledges more than he had heard from Philip: he makes a confession both of the person and office of Christ. Happy they that are thus ready to believe, swift to receive the truth and grace of God! Just thus the woman of Samaria argued, (<a href="/john/4-29.htm" title="Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?">John 4:29</a>,) <span class="ital">Come see a man who told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? </span>— Which plainly intimates, that they supposed the Messiah would be endowed with the most perfect knowledge, and have the gift of prophecy in the highest degree. <span class="ital">Because I said, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou </span>— Dost thou believe me to be the Messiah, because of the supernatural knowledge of thy character and secret actions which I have now discovered? <span class="ital">Thou shalt see greater things than these </span>— Greater instances of my power and knowledge, consequently more remarkable proofs of my mission. <span class="ital">Verily, verily, I say unto you </span>— “There is no doubt that these words are to be taken for a solemn affirmation, in which it was observable that John has constantly repeated the <span class="greekheb">αμην</span>, <span class="ital">verily, </span>while it is only mentioned once by the other evangelists; and this we may suppose him to have done, either to excite the greater attention, or in a more emphatical and stronger manner to assert the truth, not only of the thing affirmed, but of the person who affirms it. For as <span class="ital">amen </span>in the Hebrew signifies <span class="ital">truth, </span>(<a href="/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>,) so Christ, as being the true and faithful witness, is called <span class="ital">the Amen, </span><a href="/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>. This repeated asserveration, therefore, may be considered as an intimation to us, not only that the saying, unto which it is prefixed is true, but that we must regard it as proceeding from the true and faithful witness.” — Doddridge. <span class="ital">Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending, </span>&c. — Ye shall see the whole frame of nature subject to my commands, and such a surprising train of miracles wrought by me, in the whole course of my succeeding ministry, with such remarkable interpositions of Providence in my behalf, as will not only leave you no room to doubt of my mission from God, but will make it appear as if heaven was opened, and all the angels of God were continually, (as they appeared in a vision to Jacob, <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm" title="And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.">Genesis 28:12</a>,) ascending and descending to wait upon <span class="ital">the Son of man, </span>and to receive and execute his orders. Or, if we understand the prediction more literally, we may, with Dr. Hammond, refer it to Christ’s ascension, when the heaven was opened to receive him, and the angels came down from thence to wait on him, and ascended after him. The appearance of an angel in his agony might also be referred to, and of those who waited on him at his resurrection, and so he may be considered as referring his disciples to the greatest of his miracles, his resurrection from the dead, by which the truth of his mission was put beyond all doubt. And even his second and glorious coming may be included, or, as some think, may be principally intended; as if he had said, “All who believe on me now, in my state of humiliation, shall hereafter see me come in my glory, and all the angels of God with me.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:43-51 See the nature of true Christianity, it is following Jesus; devoting ourselves to him, and treading in his steps. Observe the objection Nathanael made. All who desire to profit by the word of God, must beware of prejudices against places, or denominations of men. They should examine for themselves, and they will sometimes find good where they looked for none. Many people are kept from the ways of religion by the unreasonable prejudices they conceive. The best way to remove false notions of religion, is to make trial of it. In Nathanael there was no guile. His profession was not hypocritical. He was not a dissembler, nor dishonest; he was a sound character, a really upright, godly man. Christ knows what men are indeed. Does He know us? Let us desire to know him. Let us seek and pray to be Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile; truly Christians, approved of Christ himself. Some things weak, imperfect, and sinful, are found in all, but hypocrisy belongs not to a believer's character. Jesus witnessed what passed when Nathanael was under the fig-tree. Probably he was then in fervent prayer, seeking direction as to the Hope and Consolation of Israel, where no human eye observed him. This showed him that our Lord knew the secrets of his heart. Through Christ we commune with, and benefit by the holy angels; and things in heaven and things on earth are reconciled and united together.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An Israelite indeed - One who is really an Israelite - not by birth only, but one worthy of the name.

Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.">John 8:52</a>, “out of Galilee ariseth no prophet”. Westcott, representing several modern interpreters, explains: “Can any blessing, much less such a blessing as the promised Messiah, arise out of a poor village like Nazareth, of which not even the name can be found in the O.T.?” But probably Nathanael was influenced by the circumstance that he himself was of Cana (<a href="/john/21-2.htm" title="There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.">John 21:2</a>), only a few miles from Nazareth, and with the jealousy which usually exists between neighbouring villages (inter accolas odium) found it hard to believe that Nazareth could produce the Messiah (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm" title="For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2</a>, “a root out of a dry ground”). From this remark of Nathanael’s light is reflected on the obscurity and unobtrusiveness of the youth of Jesus. Though living a few miles off, Nathanael never heard of Him. To his incredulity Philip wisely replies, <span class="greekheb">ἔρχου καὶ ἴδε</span>; as Bengel says, “optimum remedium contra opiniones praeconceptas”. And Nathanael shows himself to be willing to have his preconceptions overcome. He goes with Philip.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">47</span>. <span class="ital">saw Nathanael coming</span>] This contradicts the theory that Christ overheard Nathanael’s question.

He read the thought and character of Simon and Philip, of Nathanael, and of his mother; and here he makes use of his Divine prerogative and, as on a multitude of other occasions, penetrated the surface to the inner motive and heart. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, an Israelite indeed;</span> one who fulfils the true idea of Israel, a prince with God, a conqueror of God by prayer, and conqueror of man by submission, penitence, and restitution; one who has renounced the spirit of supplanter and taken that of penitent. "Confident in self-despair," he has relinquished his own strength, and lays hold of the strength of God, and is at peace. <span class="cmt_word">In whom is no guile;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no self-deception, and no disposition to deceive others. The (<a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>) description of the blessedness of "the man whose transgressions are forgiven,...  and in whose spirit [LXX., 'mouth'] there is no guile (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," is the finest key to the significance of this passage. Christ does not say that this man is <span class="accented">sinless</span>, but guileless - free and full in his confession, knowing himself, and sheltering himself under no devices or seeming shows. The publican (it has been well said) was without guile when he cried, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" The Pharisee was steeped in self-deception and guile when he said, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men." Sincerity, openness of eye, simplicity of speech, no wish to appear other than what he is before God and man, affirms his guilelessness. Alas! the so called Israelite has widely departed from the fundamental idea of such a character, though not more so than Christians have become unlike the ideal disciples of Jesus. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>An Israelite indeed (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x399;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>Literally, truly an Israelite. An Israelite not merely in descent, but in character, according to the ideal laid down in God's law. The word Israelite itself was an honorable designation. See on men of Israel, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>, and compare remarks on Jews, <a href="/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>.<p>Guile (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Properly, a bait for fish, and related at the root to &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, to catch with a bait, or beguile. See on beguiling, <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>. The true Israelite would be the true child of Israel after he had ceased to be the Supplanter. It is an interesting fact that in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>, Jacob is called a plain man, i.e., as some explain the Hebrew, a perfect or upright man, and others, a man of quiet and simple habits, and that the Septuagint renders this adjective by &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, unfeigned, without disguise, simple, guileless. The Greek here reads literally, in whom guile is not. </body></html>
