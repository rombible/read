Nothing more fully shows the darkness of men's minds, than that when the Light had appeared, there needed a witness to call attention to it. Christ was the true Light; that great Light which deserves to be called so. By his Spirit and grace he enlightens all that are enlightened to salvation; and those that are not enlightened by him, perish in darkness. Christ was in the world when he took our nature upon him, and dwelt among us. The Son of the Highest was here in this lower world. He was in the world, but not of it. He came to save a lost world, because it was a world of his own making. Yet the world knew him not. When he comes as a Judge, the world shall know him. Many say that they are Christ's own, yet do not receive him, because they will not part with their sins, nor have him to reign over them. All the children of God are born again. This new birth is through the word of God as the means, 1Pe 1:23, and by the Spirit of God as the Author. By his Divine presence Christ always was in the world. But now that the fulness of time was come, he was, after another manner, God manifested in the flesh. But observe the beams of his Divine glory, which darted through this veil of flesh. Men discover their weaknesses to those most familiar with them, but it was not so with Christ; those most intimate with him saw most of his glory. Although he was in the form of a servant, as to outward circumstances, yet, in respect of graces, his form was like the Son of God His Divine glory appeared in the holiness of his doctrine, and in his miracles. He was full of grace, fully acceptable to his Father, therefore qualified to plead for us; and full of truth, fully aware of the things he was to reveal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He was in the world - This refers, probably, not to his pre-existence, but to the fact that he became incarnate; that he dwelt among human beings.<p>And the world was made by him - This is a repetition of what is said in <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>. Not only "men," but all material things, were made by him. These facts are mentioned here to make what is said immediately after more striking, to wit, that men did not receive him. The proofs which he furnished that they ought to receive him were:<p>1. Those given while he was "in the world" - the miracles that he performed and his instructions; and,<p>2.

In this sense it may be used here. The world did not love or approve him, but rejected him and put him to death.

He was in the world, &c.&#8212;The language here is nearly as wonderful as the thought. Observe its compact simplicity, its sonorousness&#8212;"the world" resounding in each of its three members&#8212;and the enigmatic form in which it is couched, startling the reader and setting his ingenuity a-working to solve the stupendous enigma of Christ ignored in His own world. "The world," in the first two clauses, plainly means the created world, into which He came, says Joh 1:9; "in it He was," says this verse. By His Incarnation, He became an inhabitant of it, and bound up with it. Yet it "was made by Him" (Joh 1:3-5). Here, then, it is merely alluded to, in contrast partly with His being in it, but still more with the reception He met with from it. "The world that knew Him not" (1Jo 3:1) is of course the intelligent world of mankind. (See on [1756]Joh 1:11,12). Taking the first two clauses as one statement, we try to apprehend it by thinking of the infant Christ conceived in the womb and born in the arms of His own creature, and of the Man Christ Jesus breathing His own air, treading His own ground, supported by substances to which He Himself gave being, and the Creator of the very men whom He came to save. But the most vivid commentary on this entire verse will be got by tracing (in His matchless history) Him of whom it speaks walking amidst all the elements of nature, the diseases of men and death itself, the secrets of the human heart, and "the rulers of the darkness of this world" in all their number, subtlety, and malignity, not only with absolute ease, as their conscious Lord, but, as we might say, with full consciousness on their part of the presence of their Maker, whose will to one and all of them was law. And this is He of whom it is added, "the world knew Him not!"<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He was in the world; </span> he was in the place called <span class="ital">the world, </span> and amongst the men of the world; for so the term <span class="ital">world</span> is often taken, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a> <a href="/2_peter/3-6.htm" title="Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:">2 Peter 3:6</a></span>.

This is to be understood, not of his incarnation; for the word was denotes past existence in the world, even all the time past from the creation of the world; and the world intends the world in general, as opposed to Judea, and the people of the Jews in the next verse; besides, the incarnation of the word is spoken of in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> as a new and distinct thing from this: but of his being in the world, when first made, and since, by his essence, by which he fills the whole world; and by his power, upholding and preserving it; and by his providence, ordering and managing all the affairs of it, and influencing and governing all things in it: he was in it as the light and life of it, giving natural life and light to creatures in it, and filling it, and them, with various blessings of goodness; and he was in the promise and type before, as well as after the Jews were distinguished from other nations, as his peculiar people; and he was frequently visible in the world, in an human form, before his incarnation, as in Eden's garden to our first parents, to Abraham, Jacob, Manoah, and his wife, and others, <p>And the world was made by him: so Philo the Jew often ascribes the making of the world to the Logos, or word, as before observed on <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a> and this regards the whole universe, and all created beings in it, and therefore cannot design the new creation: besides, if all men in the world were anew created by Christ, they would know him; for a considerable branch of the new creation lies in knowledge; whereas, in the very next clause, it is asserted, that the world knew him not; and they would also love him, and obey him, which the generality of the world do not; they would appear to be in him, and so not be condemned by him, as multitudes will. To understand this of the old creation, best suits the context, and proves the deity of Christ, and his pre-existence, as the word, and Son of God, to his incarnation, <p>And the world knew him not; that is, the inhabitants of the world knew him not as their Creator: nor did they acknowledge the mercies they received from him; nor did they worship, serve, and obey him, or love and fear him; nor did they, the greater part of them, know him as the Messiah, Mediator, Saviour, and Redeemer. There was, at first, a general knowledge of Christ throughout the world among all the sons of Adam, after the first promise of him, and which, for a while, continued; but this, in process of time, being neglected and slighted, it was forgot, and utterly lost, as to the greater part of mankind; for the Gentiles, for many hundreds of years, as they knew not the true God, so they were without Christ, without any notion of the Messiah; and this their ignorance, as it was first their sin, became their punishment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{q}</span> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</span><p>(q) The person of the Word was made manifest even at that time when the world was made.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a>.

Three times in this verse <span class="ital">world</span> is repeated; three times it is said of the human race, as in the previous verse, but not to the exclusion of the other creatures, at least in the first place.—<span class="greekheb">δἰ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο</span>, <span class="ital">was made by Him</span>) <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, masculine, as presently after <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>. It is referred to the sense,[16] though <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Φῶς</span></span></span> is neuter. Artemonius, p. 439, 450, etc., maintains that there is meant here the dissolution of all things, which was now about to have taken place, at the time when Christ suffered, had it not been turned aside [removed] by His own sacrifice, and for that purpose he quotes the passage, <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>, “Now once in the end of the world hath He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.” But in that passage <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΣΥΝΤΈΛΕΙΑ ΤῶΝ ΑἸΏΝΩΝ</span></span></span> does not mean the putting off of the end of the world on [subject to] a condition, but categorically denotes the last times of the world, as opposed to the many ages that have elapsed since the foundation of the world. If such an interpretation [as Artemonius’] holds good, Israel too might be said to be <span class="ital">made by Moses</span>; inasmuch as he averted its dissolution. With the same purpose in view, Artemonius, p. 455, urges the order of time in the clauses of this verse, but without reason. There is rather in it a gradation, wherein the world is urged to the acknowledgment of the Light by that [first] reason <span class="ital">He was in the world</span>, but more so by this [second reason] <span class="ital">and the world was made by Him</span>; or in other words, <span class="ital">began to be</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>) <span class="ital">and</span> yet.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος</span>, <span class="ital">the world</span>) <span class="ital">The name world in the sacred writings implies</span> THE IMPIOUS SILLINESS [futilitatem, emptiness] OF THE HUMAN RACE.

They explain or divide the solemn theme of the previous announcement into two related proofs of the fact that the Light which illumines every man shineth in darkness, and that the darkness apprehendeth it not. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Of him who was evermore coming into the world, it is said, <span class="cmt_word">In the world he was, and the world was made</span> (came into being) <span class="cmt_word">through him, and the world recognized him not</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a term specially used by St. John to denote the ordered whole of the universe, viewed <span class="accented">apart</span> from God (see Introduction). Sometimes this is emphasized by the pronoun, "<span class="accented">This</span> world," when it is contrasted with the higher and heavenly "order" to which the Lord's personality belonged, both before and after this manifestation in the flesh. From being thus the scene of ordered existence apart from God, it rapidly moves into the organized resistance to the will of God, and therefore it often denotes humanity taken as a whole apart from God and grace. It may be the object of the Divine love and compassion (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>), while the redemption and deliverance of the world from sin is the great end of the ministry and work of Jesus (ver. 29); but throughout this gospel "the world" is the synonym of the adverse power and order of humanity, until it is illumined, regenerated, by the Spirit of God. The world here signifies humanity and its dwelling place, considered apart from the changes wrought in any part of it by grace. The three assertions concerning the world drop the imagery of light and life, and by their emphatic concatenation, without the assistance of a Greek particle, tell the tragic story of human departure from God. Thus only can the mystery of the previous verses be explained. At the very forefront of the argument of the Gospel is put a statement which concedes the strange perplexity of the rejection of the incarnate Logos. Not only does the entire narrative illustrate the awful fact, strange and inconceivable as such an idea appears when baldly stated, but the author generalizes the antipathy between the Logos and the world into a more comprehensive, damning, and yet undeniable, proposition. From the beginning, though the world came into being through the Logos, though he was in the world, in every atom of matter, in every vibration of force, in every energy of life, yet the world, notwithstanding all its power of recognizing the fact, yet the world, as concentrated in an antagonistic humanity, <span class="accented">did not</span> come to know him fully (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>). This is the lesson we learn from all the melancholy and tragic perversions of his glorious perfections which every heathenism and every cultus, and even every philosophy, has perpetrated. St. Paul says precisely the same thing: "The world by wisdom knew not God" (see also  <a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-22</a>, which might be taken as an inspired commentary on the whole passage). And the awful statement is still, with reference to the majority of men, true, that "the world knoweth not God, neither the Father, nor the Word, nor the Holy Ghost." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He was in the world<p>Not merely at His advent, but before His incarnation no less than after it.

Though He was in the world and was its Creator, yet the world did not recognize him. This is the relation of ideas in these three clauses, but John expresses this relation after the Hebrew manner, by simply putting the three side by side, and connecting them by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, and. This construction is characteristic of John. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a>, where the point of the passage is, that though Jesus was teaching publicly, where He might easily have been seized, yet no man attempted his seizure. This is expressed by two parallel clauses with the simple copulative. "These words spake Jesus," etc., "and no man laid hands on Him."<p>Him (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>The preceding him (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;) is, in itself, ambiguous as to gender. So far as its form is concerned, it might be neuter, in which case it would refer to the light, "the Word regarded as a luminous principle," as it, in <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>. But &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; is masculine, Him, so that the Word now appears as a person. This determines the gender of the preceding &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;.<p>On the enlightened and unenlightened nature, compare the allegory in Plato's "Republic," at the beginning of Book 7, where he pictures men confined from childhood in an underground den, chained so that they can only see before them, and with no light save from a fire behind them. They mistake shadows for substance, and echoes for voices. When they are liberated and compelled to look at the light, either of the fire or of the sun, their unaccustomed eyes are pained, and they imagine that the shadows which they formerly saw are truer than the real objects which are now shown them. Finally, they will be able to see the sun, and will recognize him as the giver of the seasons and years, and the guardian of all that is in the visible world. "When the eye of the soul is turned round, the whole soul must be turned round from the world of becoming into that of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or, in other words, of the good."<p>Notice also the appropriateness of the two verbs joined with the neuter and the masculine pronouns. In <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, with it, the Word, as a principle of light, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, apprehended. Here, with Him, the Word, as a person, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;, recognized. </body></html>
