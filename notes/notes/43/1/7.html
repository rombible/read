It was specially to “bear witness of the Light.” The purpose of testimony is conviction “that all men through him might believe,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> through John, through his witness. Compare with this purpose of the Baptist’s work the purpose of the Apostle’s writing, as he himself expresses it in the closing words of John 20; and also the condition and work of the Apostleship, as laid down by St. Peter at the first meeting after the Resurrection (<a href="/context/acts/1-21.htm" title="Why of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,">Acts 1:21-22</a>). The word “witness,” with its cognate forms, is one of the key-notes of the Johannine writings recurring alike in the Gospel the Epistles, and the Apocalypse. This is partly concealed from the general reader by the various renderings “record,” “testimony,” “witness,” for the one Greek root; but he may see by consulting any English concordance under these words, how frequently the thought was in the Apostle’s mind. See especially <a href="/revelation/1-2.htm" title="Who bore record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.">Revelation 1:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-9.htm" title="I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.">Revelation 1:9</a>, Notes.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 John the Baptist came to bear witness concerning Jesus. Nothing more fully shows the darkness of men's minds, than that when the Light had appeared, there needed a witness to call attention to it. Christ was the true Light; that great Light which deserves to be called so. By his Spirit and grace he enlightens all that are enlightened to salvation; and those that are not enlightened by him, perish in darkness. Christ was in the world when he took our nature upon him, and dwelt among us. The Son of the Highest was here in this lower world. He was in the world, but not of it. He came to save a lost world, because it was a world of his own making. Yet the world knew him not. When he comes as a Judge, the world shall know him. Many say that they are Christ's own, yet do not receive him, because they will not part with their sins, nor have him to reign over them. All the children of God are born again. This new birth is through the word of God as the means, 1Pe 1:23, and by the Spirit of God as the Author. By his Divine presence Christ always was in the world. But now that the fulness of time was come, he was, after another manner, God manifested in the flesh. But observe the beams of his Divine glory, which darted through this veil of flesh. Men discover their weaknesses to those most familiar with them, but it was not so with Christ; those most intimate with him saw most of his glory. Although he was in the form of a servant, as to outward circumstances, yet, in respect of graces, his form was like the Son of God His Divine glory appeared in the holiness of his doctrine, and in his miracles. He was full of grace, fully acceptable to his Father, therefore qualified to plead for us; and full of truth, fully aware of the things he was to reveal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For a witness - To give testimony.

He designed to prepare them for it; to announce that the Messiah was about to come, to direct the minds of men to him, and thus to prepare them to believe on him when he came. Thus, he baptized them, saying "That they should believe on him who should come after him" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/19-4.htm">Acts 19:4</a>, and thus he produced a very general expectation that the Messiah was about to come. The testimony of John was especially valuable on the following accounts:<p>1. It was made when he had no personal acquaintance with Jesus of Nazareth, and of course there could have been no collusion or agreement to deceive them, <a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>.<p>2. It was sufficiently long before he came to excite general attention, and to fix the mind on it.<p>3. It was that of a man acknowledged by all to be a prophet of God - "for all men held John to be a prophet," <a href="/matthew/21-26.htm">Matthew 21:26</a>.<p>4. It was "for the express purpose" of declaring beforehand that he was about to appear.<p>5. It was "disinterested."<p>He was himself extremely popular. Many were disposed to receive him as the Messiah. It was evidently in his "power" to form a large party, and to be regarded extensively as the Christ. This was the highest honor to which a Jew could aspire; and it shows the value of John's testimony, that he was willing to lay all his honors at the feet of Jesus, and to acknowledge that he was unworthy to perform for him the office of the humblest servant, <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>.<p>Through him - Through John, or by means of his testimony.<p>Was not that Light - Was not "the Messiah."

As John came that all might believe, so it is no less true of the ministry of Jesus himself.

The end of his being sent, and the design of his coming were, <p>to bear witness of the light: by which is meant, not the light of nature, or reason; nor the light of the Gospel: but Christ himself, the author of light, natural, spiritual, and eternal. This was one of the names of the Messiah with the Jews; of whom they say (u), , "light is his name"; as it is said in <a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a> and the light dwelleth with him; on which they have (w) elsewhere this gloss, this is the King Messiah; and so they interpret <a href="/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a> of him (x). Philo the Jew often speaks of the Logos, or word, as light, and calls him the intelligible light; the universal light, the most perfect light; represents him as full of divine light; and says, he is called the sun (y). Now John came to bear a testimony to him, as he did; of which an account is given in this chapter, very largely, and elsewhere; as that he testified of his existence before his incarnation; of his being with the Father, and in his bosom: of his deity and divine sonship; of his being the Messiah; of the fulness of grace that was in him; of his incarnation and satisfaction; of his descent from heaven; and of his relation to his church, as in <a href="/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a> the end of which witness was, <p>that all men through him might believe; that is, that the Jews, to whom he preached, might, through his testimony, believe that Jesus was the light, and true Messiah; for these words are to be taken in a limited sense, and not to be extended, to every individual of mankind; since millions were dead before John began his testimony, and multitudes then in being, and since, whom it never reached: nor can it design more than the Jews, to whom alone he bore witness of Christ; and the faith which he taught, and required by his testimony, was an assent unto him as the Messiah; though the preaching of the Gospel is a means of true spiritual faith in Christ; and doubtless it was so to many, as preached by John: it points out the object of faith, and encourages souls to believe in Christ; and hence, Gospel ministers are instruments by whom ethers believe; and faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and then is it, considerable end of the Gospel ministry answered, <p>(u) Echa Rabbati, fol. 50. 2.((w) Bereshit Rabba, fol. 1. 3.

John was not to do a great work of his own but to point to another. All his experience, zeal, and influence were to be spent in testifying to the true Light.

That which the Baptist did, Malachi, Isaiah, Elijah, Hosea, Moses, had done in their day. He came, and by penetrating insight and burning word, by flashes of moral revelation and intense earnestness, "bare witness concerning the Light" which was ever shining into the darkness. His aim and theirs was to prevent the forces of darkness from suppressing or absorbing the light. He came to sting the apathy and disturb the self-complacency of the darkness. He came to interpret the fact of the Light which was shining but not apprehended; and so did all the prophetic ministry of which he was the latest and most illustrious exponent. He came to assert the meaning for man of all God's perfections; to call conscience from its death sleep; to draw distinctions of tremendous significance between moral and ceremonial obedience; to exalt obedience above sacrifice, and works meet for repentance above Abrahamic privilege; to warn by lurid threatenings of a fiery wrath and a terrible curse which would fall on the disobedient, though consecrated, people. In this he was but the last of a goodly fellowship of prophets who bore witness to the Light of life which had its being in the Eternal Logos of God. He came, as they all had come, with a view of producing results far greater than, as a matter of fact, they have actually achieved. He came to bear such testimony <span class="cmt_word">that all through him</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the force of his appeal or by the fierce glow thus cast upon the perils and follies of the hour, <span class="cmt_word">might believe</span> - might realize the full significance of the Light which they had hitherto refused to accept. The greatness of this expectation corresponds with the hope which the ministry of Jesus failed also to realize (<a href="/matthew/11-9.htm">Matthew 11:9-14</a>). The splendid ministry of this "burning and shining lamp" might, it would seem, have brought all Israel to  acknowledge Christ as the Light of the world; but "the darkness apprehended it not." The entire prophetic dispensation, the testimony which the priestly services and sacrifices bore to the evil of sin and to the awfulness of righteousness, as well as the condemnation of the follies and pleasures of the world, involved in John the Baptist's ascetic profession, might have roused all Israel to believe in the Light. He gathered together all the forces of the Mosaic, prophetic, Levitical, Essenic ministries to bear on the people. Everything that Law could do was done to reveal the Light; but "all" did not believe, for "the darkness apprehended it not." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The same (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-2.htm">John 1:2</a>, and the pronoun &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, he, in <a href="/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8</a>.<p>For a witness (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Revised version of the New Testament, more correctly, for witness: a witness would be, &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; as <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.

It is one of John's characteristic words, occurring nearly fifty times in various forms in his Gospel, and thirty or forty times in the Epistles and Revelation. The emphatic development of the idea of witness is peculiar to this Gospel. "It evidently belongs to a time when men had begun to reason about the faith, and to analyze the grounds on which it rested" (Westcott). He develops the idea under the following forms: The witness of the Father (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm">John 5:31</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm">John 5:34</a>, <a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>); the witness of Christ himself (<a href="/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>; <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>); the witness of works (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>, <a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25</a>; <a href="/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>; <a href="/john/15-24.htm">John 15:24</a>); the witness of Scripture (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a>, <a href="/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>; <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>); the witness of the forerunner (<a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>, <a href="/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>); the witness of the disciples (<a href="/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>; <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; <a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14</a>); the witness of the Spirit (<a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, <a href="/john/16-14.htm">John 16:14</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>).
