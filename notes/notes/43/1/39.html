Whatever communion there is between our souls and Christ, it is he who begins the discourse. He asked, What seek ye? The question Jesus put to them, we should all put to ourselves when we begin to follow Him, What do we design and desire? In following Christ, do we seek the favour of God and eternal life? He invites them to come without delay. Now is the accepted time, 2Co 6:2. It is good for us to be where Christ is, wherever it be. We ought to labour for the spiritual welfare of those related to us, and seek to bring them to Him.

He gave them an invitation, to go along with him directly, and see with their own eyes, where he dwelt, and there and then converse with him, and at any other time; to which they had a hearty welcome: <p>they came and saw where he dwelt; they accepted of the invitation, and went along with him immediately, and saw, and took notice of the place where he had lodgings, that they might know it, and find it another time; which Dr. Lightfoot conjectures was at Capernaum, which is very probable; since that was his own city, where he paid tribute, where he frequently resorted, and was on the banks of Jordan, near the lake of Gennesaret; and these disciples were Galilaeans: <p>and abode with him that day; the remaining part of the day, which they spent in delightful conversation with him; by which they knew that he was the Messiah; at least they were better instructed in this matter, and more confirmed in it. The Arabic version renders it, "they remained with him that his own day"; and Dr. Lightfoot thinks the next day is meant, and that it was the sabbath day, which they kept with him in private devotion and conference: <p>for it was about the tenth hour; which, according to the Roman way of reckoning, must be ten o'clock in the morning; so that there was a considerable part of the day before them; but according to the Jewish way of reckoning, who reckon twelve hours to a day, it must be four o'clock in the afternoon, when there were but two hours to night: and this being; about the time when the lamb of the daily sacrifice of the evening was offered up, very seasonably did John point unto them, at this time, Christ the Lamb of God, the antitype of that sacrifice; for the daily evening sacrifice was slain at eight and a half, and was offered at nine and a half (f), or between the ninth and tenth hours of the day.

John reckons the hours of the day according to the modern method, from midnight to midnight, and not according to the <span class="ital">Jewish</span> method, from sunset to sunset, as everywhere else in N.T. and in Josephus. It is antecedently improbable that S. John should in this point vary from the rest of N.T. writers; and we ought to require strong evidence before accepting this theory, which has been adopted mainly in order to escape from the difficulty of <a href="/john/19-14.htm" title="And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he said to the Jews, Behold your King!">John 19:14</a>, where see notes. Setting aside <a href="/john/19-14.htm" title="And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he said to the Jews, Behold your King!">John 19:14</a> as the cause of the question, we have four passages in which S. John mentions the hour of the day, this, <a href="/john/4-6.htm" title="Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6</a>; <a href="/john/4-52.htm" title="Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.">John 4:52</a> and <a href="/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.">John 11:9</a>. None of them are decisive: but in no single case is the balance of probability strongly in favour of the modern method. See notes in each place. Here either 10 a.m. or 4 p.m. would suit the context: and while the antecedent probability that S. John reckons time like the rest of the Evangelists will incline us to 4 p.m., the fact that a good deal still remains to be done on this day makes 10 a.m. rather more suitable. Origen knows nothing of S. John’s using the modern method of reckoning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/1-39.htm" title="He said to them, Come and see.

On that hypothesis the "tenth hour" would be ten a.m., and the two disciples would have remained with our Lord throughout the day. This is not necessarily involved by our present context, and we are not sure that a like supposition will free us from all difficulty in <a href="/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>. Meyer says that "the <span class="accented">Jewish</span> reckoning is involved necessarily in <a href="/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a>; and in <a href="/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6, 52</a> it is not excluded." The ordinary New Testament measurement would make the hour four p.m., and on that understanding several hours might still be open for the sacred fellowship. The personal witness shows himself by this delicate hint of exact time, this special note of remembrance concerning the most critical epoch of his life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>See (&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>But the correct reading is &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;, ye shall see.<p>They came<p>The best texts add &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;, therefore. So Rev. This connecting particle is found in John's Gospel as often as in the other three combined, and most commonly in narrative, marking the transition from one thing to another, and serving to connect the several parts of the narrative. See <a href="/john/1-22.htm">John 1:22</a>; <a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>; <a href="/john/3-25.htm">John 3:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-30.htm">John 4:30</a>, etc. Much more frequently thus than in the discourses, where it would be used to mark a sequence of thought. Still such instances occur, as <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>, <a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>; <a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5</a>; <a href="/john/4-11.htm">John 4:11</a>.<p>He dwelt (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>The present tense. Literally, they saw where he dwelleth. For a similar construction see <a href="/john/2-9.htm">John 2:9</a>; <a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-18.htm">Acts 10:18</a>, etc.<p>Tenth hour<p>The question is whether this is to be reckoned according to the Jewish or the Roman method of computation. The Jewish method, employed by the other Evangelists, begins the day at sunrise; so that, according to this, the tenth hour would be four o'clock in the afternoon. The Roman method, like our own, reckons from midnight; according to which the tenth hour would be ten o'clock in the morning. The weight of the argument seems, on the whole, to be in favor of the Jewish method, which is undoubtedly assumed by John in <a href="/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9</a>. The Greeks of Asia Minor, for whom John wrote, had the Jewish method, received from the Babylonians. Godet cites an incident from the "Sacred Discourses" of Aelius Aristides, a Greek sophist of the second century, and a contemporary of Polycarp. God having commanded him to take a bath, he chose the sixth hour as the most favorable to health. It being winter, and the bath a cold one, the hour was midday; for he said to his friend who kept him waiting, "Seest thou the shadow is already turning?" Even Canon Westcott, who advocates the Roman method, admits that "this mode of reckoning was unusual in ancient times," and that "the Romans and Greeks, no less than the Jews, reckoned their hours from sunrise," though the Romans reckoned their civil days from midnight, and the tenth hour is named as a late hour, when soldiers took their repast or were allowed to rest. Thus Livy, in his account of the Roman attack on Sutrium says, "About the tenth hour the consul ordered his men a repast, and gave directions that they should be ready in arms at whatever time of the day or night he should give the signal.... After refreshing themselves, they consigned themselves to rest" (9, 37).<p>Aristophanes says, "When the shadow on the dial is ten feet long, then go to dinner" ("Ecclesiazusae," 648), and Horace, "You will dine with me today. Come after the ninth hour" ("Epistle," Bk. 1., vii., 69). It is objected that the time from four o'clock to the close of the day would not have been described as that day; but beyond the marking of the specific hour of accompanying Jesus as the first hour of his Christian life, John would not have been unlikely to use a looser and more popular form of speech in indicating the length of the stay with Jesus, meaning simply that they remained with him during the remainder of the day, and, no doubt, prolonged their conversation into the night. </body></html>
