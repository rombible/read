He came in the spirit and power of Elias, but he was not the person of Elias. John was not that Prophet whom Moses said the Lord would raise up to them of their brethren, like unto him. He was not such a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans. He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them to hearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession of repentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to be conferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, though they knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanest service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art thou Elias? - This is the Greek way of writing Elijah. The Jews expected that Elijah would appear before the Messiah came. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>. They supposed that it would be the real Elijah returned from heaven. In this sense John denied that he was Elijah; but he did not deny that he was the Elias or Elijah which the prophet intended <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>, for he immediately proceeds to state <a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> that he was sent, as it was predicted that Elijah would be, to prepare the way of the Lord; so that, while he corrected their false notions about Elijah, he so clearly stated to them his true character that they might understand that he was really the one predicted as Elijah.<p>That prophet - It is possible that the Jews supposed that not only "Elijah" would reappear before the coming of the Messiah, but also "Jeremiah." See the notes at <a href="/matthew/16-14.htm">Matthew 16:14</a>.

And there were various talks and discourses of the people about him, which they were not willing to take up and run away with; but they desired to have it from himself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said they unto him, who art thou?....
