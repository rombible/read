See the note on <a href="/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14</a>. The Baptist made this declaration, lest the surrounding multitude should have imagined that Jesus assumed, and that he gave him, the title of Messiah, by private concert between themselves. But how surprising is this that John here asserts, considering how nearly they were related, and how remarkable the conception and birth of them both had been. But through the peculiar providence of God, it was ordered that our Saviour should live from his infancy to his baptism at Nazareth, while John lived all that time the life of a hermit, in the deserts of Judea, ninety or more miles from Nazareth. Hereby that acquaintance was prevented which might have made John’s testimony of Christ suspected. <span class="ital">And John bare record, saying, I saw</span> <span class="ital">the Spirit </span>— From the time that the Baptist had the Messiah discovered to him by supernatural revelation, and the appearance of the sign which God had told him of, he openly pointed him out to the Jews, declaring, at the same time, the ground on which he proceeded in this matter, namely, the descent of the Spirit, which was the sign mentioned by God himself.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:29-36 John saw Jesus coming to him, and pointed him out as the Lamb of God. The paschal lamb, in the shedding and sprinkling of its blood, the roasting and eating of its flesh, and all the other circumstances of the ordinance, represented the salvation of sinners by faith in Christ. And the lambs sacrificed every morning and evening, can only refer to Christ slain as a sacrifice to redeem us to God by his blood. John came as a preacher of repentance, yet he told his followers that they were to look for the pardon of their sins to Jesus only, and to his death. It agrees with God's glory to pardon all who depend on the atoning sacrifice of Christ. He takes away the sin of the world; purchases pardon for all that repent and believe the gospel. This encourages our faith; if Christ takes away the sin of the world, then why not my sin? He bore sin for us, and so bears it from us. God could have taken away sin, by taking away the sinner, as he took away the sin of the old world; but here is a way of doing away sin, yet sparing the sinner, by making his Son sin, that is, a sin-offering, for us. See Jesus taking away sin, and let that cause hatred of sin, and resolutions against it. Let us not hold that fast, which the Lamb of God came to take away. To confirm his testimony concerning Christ, John declares the appearance at his baptism, in which God himself bore witness to him. He saw and bare record that he is the Son of God. This is the end and object of John's testimony, that Jesus was the promised Messiah. John took every opportunity that offered to lead people to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The next day - The day after the Jews made inquiry whether he was the Christ.<p>Behold the Lamb of God - A "lamb," among the Jews, was killed and eaten at the Passover to commemorate their deliverance from Egypt, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-11</a>.

A lamb, among the Jews, was also an emblem of patience, meekness, gentleness. On "all" these accounts, rather than on any one of them alone, Jesus was called "the Lamb." He was innocent <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23-25</a>; he was a sacrifice for sin the substance represented by the daily offering of the lamb, and slain at the usual time of the evening sacrifice <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44-46</a>; and he was what was represented by the Passover, turning away the anger of God, and saving sinners by his blood from vengeance and eternal death, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<p>Of God - Appointed by God, approved by God, and most dear to him; the sacrifice which he chose, and which he approves to save people from death.<p>Which taketh away - This denotes his "bearing" the sins of the world, or the sufferings which made an atonement for sin.

He takes away sin by "bearing" in his own body the sufferings which God appointed to show his sense of the evil of sin, thus magnifying the law, and rendering it consistent for him to pardon.

In the Levitical victims both ideas met, as they do in Christ, the people's guilt being viewed as transferred to them, avenged in their death, and so borne away by them (Le 4:15; 16:15, 21, 22; and compare Isa 53:6-12; 2Co 5:21).<p>the sin&#8212;The singular number being used to mark the collective burden and all-embracing efficacy.<p>of the world&#8212;not of Israel only, for whom the typical victims were exclusively offered.

The words mean: “Subsequent to me in point of time comes a man who has gained a place in advance of me, because He was eternally prior to me”.—<span class="greekheb">ὀπίσω μου ἔρχεται</span> refers rather to space than to time, “after me,” but with the notion of immediacy, close behind, following upon. As certainly, <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθέν μου γέγονεν</span> refers to position or dignity; He has come to be in front of me, or ahead of me. So used sometimes in classic writers; as <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ δικαίου</span>, preferred before justice.

It is difficult to escape the impression that something more is meant than <span class="greekheb">πρότερος</span> would have conveyed, some more absolute priority. As <span class="greekheb">οἱ πρῶτοι στρατοῦ</span> are the chief men or leaders, it might be supposed that John meant to say that Christ was his supreme, in virtue of whom he himself lived and worked.

If the shorter reading of vers. 26, 27 be correct, then the occasion on which this great utterance was first made is not described. If it be not expunged from vers. 26, 27, we may imagine that John is now referring to what he said on the previous day to the Sanhedrim. If internal reasons may help to decide a reading, I should be inclined, with Godet as against Meyer, to say that this is the obvious reference.

Also man as endowed with courage, intelligence, strength, and other noble attributes (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>).<p>&#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is generic, without distinction of sex, a human being (<a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>), though often used in connections which indicate or imply sex, as <a href="/matthew/19-10.htm">Matthew 19:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35</a>. Used of mankind (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>), or of the people (<a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-18.htm">Matthew 6:18</a>; <a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>). Of man as distinguished from animals or plants (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>), and from God, Christ as divine and angels (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>; <a href="/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15</a>).

The more honorable and noble sense thus attaches to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1; rather than to &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Thus Herodotus says that when the Medes charged the Greeks, they fell in vast numbers, so that it was manifest to Xerxes that he had many men combatants (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) but few warriors (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) vii., 210. So Homer: "O friends, be men (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), and take on a stout heart" ("Iliad," v., 529). &#x391;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1; is therefore used here of Jesus by the Baptist with a sense of dignity. Compare &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>, where the word implies no disparagement, but is simply indefinite. In John &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1; has mostly the sense of husband (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-16.htm">John 4:16-18</a>). See <a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10</a>. </body></html>
