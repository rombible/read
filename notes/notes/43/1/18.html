The verse is connected, by a likeness of Greek words too striking to be accidental, with the question of Jesus the son of Sirach asked some three centuries before, “Who hath seen Him that he might tell us?” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/43-31.htm" title="There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works.">Ecclesiasticus 43:31</a>). The answer to every such question, dimly thought or clearly asked, is that no man hath ever so known God as to be His interpreter; that the human conception of God as “terrible” and “great” and “marvellous” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/43-29.htm" title="When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; for even yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough.">Ecclesiasticus 43:29</a>) is not that of His essential character; that the true conception is that of the loving Father in whose bosom is the only Son, and that this Son is the only true Word uttering to man the will and character and being of God.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">No man hath seen God at any time — </span>Nor, indeed, can see him as he is, an incorporeal, and, therefore, an invisible Being: but <span class="ital">the only- begotten Son, </span>&c. — John, having spoken of the incarnation, now calls Christ by this name, and no more terms him <span class="ital">the Word, </span>in all his book; <span class="ital">who is in the bosom of the Father </span>— And ever favoured with the most endearing and intimate converse with him. The expression denotes the highest unity, and the most perfect knowledge. <span class="ital">He hath declared him — </span>Hath revealed him in a much clearer and fuller manner than he was made known before, and that by such discoveries of his nature, attributes, and will, as have the most powerful tendency to render us holy and happy. The following particulars are evidently implied in this passage: 1st, That, as the nature of God is spiritual, he is invisible to our bodily eyes. He is a Being whose essence no man hath seen or can see, (<a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Timothy 1:17</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1 Timothy 6:16</a>,) though Moses and others frequently heard his voice, and saw the bright cloud and external glory, that was a symbol of his presence. 2d, That the revelation, which God made of himself under the Old Testament dispensation, was very inferior to that which he has made by Christ; and what was seen and known of him before Christ’s incarnation was little, in comparison with what may now be seen and known; life and immortality being now brought to light in a far higher degree than they were then. And, 3d, That neither Moses, nor any of the Old Testament prophets, were so well qualified to make God and his will known to mankind, as our Lord Jesus Christ was. They never saw, nor perfectly knew the Divine Being, and his eternal counsels, and therefore could not make a full discovery thereof to men. The only person who ever enjoyed this privilege was the only-begotten Son of God, <span class="ital">the Word, </span>which was in the beginning with him, or, as it is here expressed, was, and <span class="ital">is, in the bosom of the Father: </span>that is, always was, and is the object of his tenderest, yea, of his infinite affection, complacency, and delight, and the intimate partner of his counsels. And this circumstance recommends Christ’s holy religion to us unspeakably before any others; that it was founded by one that had seen God, or that had clear and perfect knowledge of him, and of his mind and will, which no other person ever had, or could have.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 As to the order of time and entrance on his work, Christ came after John, but in every other way he was before him. The expression clearly shows that Jesus had existence before he appeared on earth as man. All fulness dwells in him, from which alone fallen sinners have, and shall receive, by faith, all that renders them wise, strong, holy, useful, and happy. Our receivings by Christ are all summed up in this one word, grace; we have received even grace, a gift so great, so rich, so invaluable; the good will of God towards us, and the good work of God in us. The law of God is holy, just, and good; and we should make the proper use of it. But we cannot derive from it pardon, righteousness, or strength. It teaches us to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, but it cannot supply the place of that doctrine. As no mercy comes from God to sinners but through Jesus Christ, no man can come to the Father but by him; no man can know God, except as he is made known in the only begotten and beloved Son.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No man hath seen God at any time - This declaration is probably made to show the superiority of the revelation of Jesus above that of any previous dispensation. It is said, therefore, that Jesus "had an intimate knowledge of God," which neither Moses nor any of the ancient prophets had possessed. God is invisible: no human eyes have seen him; but Christ had a knowledge of God which might be expressed to our apprehension by saying that he saw him. He knew him intimately and completely, and was therefore fitted to make a fuller manifestation of him. See <a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>; <a href="/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>; <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>. This passage is not meant to deny that men had witnessed "manifestations" of God, as when he appeared to Moses and the prophets (compare <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-13</a>); but it is meant that no one has seen the essence of God, or has "fully known God." The prophets delivered what they "heard" God speak; Jesus what he knew of God as his equal, and as understanding fully nature.<p>The only-begotten Son - See the notes at <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. This verse shows John's sense of the meaning of that phrase, as denoting an intimate and full knowledge of God.<p>In the bosom of the Father - This expression is taken from the custom among the Orientals of reclining at their meals. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a>. It denotes intimacy, friendship, affection. Here it means that Jesus had a knowledge of God such as one friend has of another - knowledge of his character, designs, and nature which no other one possesses, and which renders him, therefore, qualified above all others to make him known.<p>Hath declared him - Hath fully revealed him or made him known. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>. This verse proves that Jesus had a knowledge of God above that which any of the ancient prophets had, and that the fullest revelations of his character are to be expected in the gospel. By his Word and Spirit he can enlighten and guide us, and lead us to the true knowledge of God; and there is no true and full knowledge of God which is not obtained through his Son.

That is, God the Father, whose voice was never heard, nor his shape seen by angels or men; for though Jacob, Moses, the elders of Israel, Manoah, and his wife, are said to see God, and Job expected to see him with his bodily eyes, and the saints will see him as he is, in which will lie their great happiness; yet all seems to be understood of the second person, who frequently appeared to the Old Testament saints, in an human form, and will be seen by the saints in heaven, in his real human nature; or of God in and by him: for the essence of God is invisible, and not to be seen with the eyes of the body; nor indeed with the eyes of the understanding, so as to comprehend it; nor immediately, but through, and by certain means: God is seen in the works of creation and providence, in the promises, and in his ordinances; but above all, in Christ the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person: this may chiefly intend here, man's not knowing any thing of God in a spiritual and saving way, but in and by Christ; since it follows, <p>the only begotten Son; the word that was with God in the beginning. The Jerusalem Targum on <a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a> says almost the same of the word of the Lord, as here, where it introduces him saying, <p>"the word of the Lord God said, lo, the man whom I created, the only one in my world, even as I am,  "the only one", (or, as the word is sometimes rendered, "the only begotten",) in the highest heavens. <p>And to the same purpose the Targum of Jonathan, and also Jarchi, on the same place. The Syriac version here renders it, "the only begotten, God which is in the bosom of the Father"; clearly showing, that he is the only begotten, as he is God: the phrase, <p>which is in the bosom of the Father, denotes unity of nature, and essence, in the Father and Son; their distinct personality; strong love, and affection between them; the Son's acquaintance with his Father's secrets; his being at that time, as the Son of God, in the bosom of his Father, when here on earth, as the son of man; and which qualified him to make the declaration of him: <p>he hath declared him. The Persic and Ethiopic versions further add, "to us"; he has clearly and fully declared his nature, perfections, purposes, promises, counsels, covenant, word, and works; his thoughts and schemes of grace; his love and favour to the sons of men; his mind and will concerning the salvation of his people: he has made, and delivered a fuller revelation of these things, than ever was yet; and to which no other revelation in the present state of things will be added. Somewhat like this the Jews (n) say of the Messiah, <p>"there is none that can declare the name of his Father, and that knows him; but this is hid from the eyes of the multitude, until he comes,  "and he shall declare him". <p>He is come, and has declared him: so Philo speaks of the "Logos", or word, as the interpreter of the mind of God, and a teacher of men (o), <p>(n) R.

Thus also must we explain the statement of direction towards, <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν κόλπ</span>., which would be otherwise without any explanation (<a href="/mark/2-1.htm" title="And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.">Mark 2:1</a>; <a href="/mark/13-16.htm" title="And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.">Mark 13:16</a>; <a href="/luke/11-7.htm" title="And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you.">Luke 11:7</a>); so that we recognise in <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> as the prominent element the idea of <span class="ital">having arrived at</span> (Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex.

T. p. 333]), not the notion of <span class="ital">leaning upon</span> (Godet, after Winer, Lücke, Tholuck, Maier, Gess, and most others), nor of <span class="ital">moving towards</span>, which is warranted neither by the simple <span class="greekheb">ὦν</span> (in favour of which such analogies as <span class="ital">in aurem dormire</span> are inappropriate) nor by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, instead of which <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> (Hom. <span class="ital">Il</span>. vi. 467) or <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> with the accusative ought rather to bo expected.[109] This forced interpretation of <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> would never have been attempted, had not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὮΝ</span></span></span> been construed as a <span class="ital">timeless</span> Present, expressing an <span class="ital">inherent</span> relation, and in this sense applied (Lücke, Tholuck, De Wette, Lange, Brückner, Hengstenberg, Philippi, and most expositors) also to the earthly condition of the Son; comp. Beyschlag, pp. 100, 150. So far as the <span class="ital">thing</span> itself is concerned, the <span class="greekheb">εἶναι εἰς τὸν κόλπ</span>. does not differ from the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἾΝΑΙ ΠΡῸς ΤῸΝ ΘΕΌΝ</span></span></span> of <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; only it expresses the fullest fellowship with God, not before the incarnation, but after the exaltation, and at the same time exhibits the relation of <span class="ital">love</span> under a sensuous form (<span class="greekheb">κόλπον</span>); not derived, however, from the custom (<a href="/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>) of reclining at table (thus usually, but not appropriately in respect of fellowship with <span class="ital">God</span>), but rather from the analogy of a father’s embrace (<a href="/luke/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;">Luke 16:22</a>). In its <span class="ital">pragmatic</span> bearing, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὦν</span> is the historical <span class="ital">seal</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξηγήσατο</span>; but we must not explain it, with Hilgenfeld, from the Gnostic idea of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἘΚΕῖΝΟς</span></span></span>] strongly emphatic, and pointing heavenwards.[110]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐξηγήσατο</span>] namely, the substance of His intuition of God; comp. <a href="/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a>.

It does not occur elsewhere in John, and hence a <span class="ital">special</span> reference in its <span class="ital">selection</span> here is all the more to be presumed, the more strikingly appropriate it is to the context (against Lücke, Maier, Godet). Comp.

Tholuck and Hengstenberg, that a relation of the <span class="greekheb">μονογενής</span> is portrayed which was neither interrupted nor modified by the incarnation. The communion of the Incarnate One with God remained, He in God, and God in Him, but not in the same manner metaphysically as before His incarnation and after His exaltation. He while on earth was still <span class="ital">in heaven</span> (<a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>), yet not <span class="ital">de facto</span>, but <span class="ital">de jure</span>, because heaven was His home, His ancestral seat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[109] Philippi’s objections (<span class="ital">Glaubens</span>. IV. 1, p. 409 f.) to my rendering are quite baseless. For an explanation of the <span class="greekheb">ὦν εἰς τὸν κόλπ</span>. which occurs to every unprejudiced expositor as coming directly from the words themselves cannot be “arbitrary.” And it is not <span class="ital">contrary to the connection</span>, as both Godet and Beyschlag hold, because what the words, as usually interpreted, say, is already contained in the <span class="greekheb">ὁ μονογενής υἱός</span>, whereupon <span class="greekheb">ὁὦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>. sets forth the exaltation of the Only-begotten—just as in <span class="greekheb">ὁ μονογ</span>· <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span> were given the <span class="ital">ground</span> and <span class="ital">source</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξηγήσατο</span>—as the infallible <span class="ital">confirmation</span> hereof. This also against Gess, p. 124. My interpretation is quite as compatible with <span class="ital">earnest dealing in regard to the deity of Christ</span> (Hengstenberg) as the usual one, while both are open to abuse. Besides, we have nothing at all to do here with the <span class="ital">earnestness</span> referred to, but simply with the <span class="ital">correctness</span> or <span class="ital">incorrectness</span> of the interpretation. Further, I have not through fear of spiritualism (as Beyschlag imagines) deviated from the usual meaning, which would quite agree with <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[110] As with Homer (see Nitzsch, p. 37, note 1), so in the N. T. John pre-eminently requires not merely to be <span class="ital">read</span>, but to be spoken. His work is the epic among the Gospels.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Note</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Prologue, which we must not with Reuss restrict to <a href="/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....">John 1:1-5</a>, is not “<span class="ital">A History of the Logos</span>,” describing Him down to <a href="/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a> as He was <span class="ital">before</span> His incarnation, and from <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> ff. as <span class="ital">incarnate</span> (Olshausen). Against this it is decisive that <a href="/context/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John....">John 1:6-13</a> already refer to the period of His <span class="ital">human</span> existence, and that, in particular, the sonship of believers, <a href="/context/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:...">John 1:12-13</a>, cannot be understood in any other than a specifically <span class="ital">Christian</span> sense. For this reason, too, we must not adopt the division of Ewald: (1) The pre-mundane history of the Logos, <a href="/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....">John 1:1-3</a>; (2) The history of His first purely spiritual working up to the time of His incarnation, <a href="/context/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men....">John 1:4-13</a>; (3) The history of His human manifestation and ministry, <a href="/context/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth....">John 1:14-18</a>. John is intent rather on securing, in grand and condensed outline, a profound <span class="ital">comprehensive view of the nature and work</span> of the Logos; which latter, the work, was in respect of the world <span class="ital">creative</span>, in respect of mankind <span class="ital">illuminative</span> (the <span class="ital">Light</span>). As this working of the Logos <span class="ital">was</span> historical, the <span class="ital">description</span> must necessarily also bear an historical character; not in such a way, however, that a formal history was to be given, first of the <span class="greekheb">λόγος ἄσαρκος</span> (which could not have been given), and then of the <span class="greekheb">λόγος ἔνσαρκος</span> (which forms the substance of the <span class="ital">Gospel itself</span>), but in such a way that the whole forms a <span class="ital">historical picture</span>, in which we see, in the world which came into existence by the creative power of the Logos, His <span class="ital">light</span> shining before, after, and by means of His incarnation. This at the same time tells against Hilgenfeld, p. 60 ff., according to whom, in the Prologue, “the Gnosis of the absolute religion, from its immediate foundation to its highest perfection, runs through the series of its historical interventions.” According to Köstlin, p. 102 ff., there is a brief triple description of all Christianity from the beginning onwards to the present; and this, too, (1) from the standing-point of God and His relation to the world, <a href="/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....">John 1:1-8</a>; then (2) from the relations of the Logos to mankind; <a href="/context/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world....">John 1:9-13</a>; and lastly, (3) in the individual, <a href="/context/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth....">John 1:14-18</a>, by which the end returns to the beginning, <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. But a triple beginning (which Kaeuffer too assumes in the <span class="ital">Sächs. Stud</span>. 1844, p. 103 ff.) is neither formally hinted at nor really made: for, in <a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span> is not the subject <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>, and this <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> must, agreeably to the context, refer to the time of the Baptist, while Köstlin’s construction and explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμενον</span> is quite untenable; and because in the last part, from <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> onwards, the antithesis between receiving and not receiving, so essential in the first two parts, does not at all recur again. The simple explanation, in harmony with the text, is as follows: The Prologue consists of three parts,—namely, (1) John gives a description (<span class="ital">a</span>) of the primeval <span class="ital">existence</span> of the Logos, <a href="/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....">John 1:1-2</a>, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) of His <span class="ital">creative</span> work, <a href="/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a> (with the addition of the first part of <a href="/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a>, which is the transition to what follows). Next, (2) he represents Him in whom was life as the <span class="ital">Light of mankind</span>, <a href="/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a> ff., and this indeed (<span class="ital">a</span>) as He once had been, when still without the antithesis of darkness, <a href="/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a>, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) as He was in this antithesis, <a href="/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>. This shining in the darkness is continuous (hence <span class="greekheb">φαίνει</span>, <a href="/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">θεὸν οὐδεὶς ἑώρακεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐξηγήσατο</span>. This statement, “God no one has ever seen,” is probably suggested by the words <span class="greekheb">διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ</span>. The reality and the grace of God we have seen through Jesus Christ, but why not directly? Because God, the Divine essence, the Godhead, no one has ever seen. No man has had immediate knowledge of God: if we have knowledge of God it is through Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A further description is given of the Only Begotten intended to disclose His qualification for revealing the Father in the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν εἰς τὸν κόλπον τοῦ πατρός</span>. Meyer supposes that John is now expressing himself from his own present standing point, and is conceiving of Christ as in His state of exaltation, as having returned to the bosom of the Father. But in this case the description would not be relevant. John adds this designation to ground the revealing work which Christ accomplished while on earth (<span class="greekheb">ἐξηγήσατο</span>, aorist, referring to that work), to prove His qualification for it. It must therefore include His condition previous to incarnation. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὤν</span> is therefore a timeless present and <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is used, as in <a href="/mark/13-16.htm" title="And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.">Mark 13:16</a>, <a href="/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>, etc., for <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν κόλπον</span>, whether taken from friends reclining at a feast or from a father’s embrace, denotes perfect intimacy. Thus qualified, <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος ἐξηγήσατο</span> “He” emphatic, He thus equipped, “has interpreted” what? See <a href="/john/8-32.htm" title="And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.">John 8:32</a>; or simply, as implied in the preceding negative clause, “God”. The Scholiast on Soph., <span class="ital">Ajax</span>, 320, says, <span class="greekheb">ἐξήγησις ἐπὶ θείων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἑρμηνεία ἐπὶ τῶν τυχόντων</span>, Wetstein.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. The Evangelist solemnly sums up the purpose of the Incarnation of the Logos—to be a visible revelation of the invisible God. It was in this way that ‘the truth came through Jesus Christ,’ for the truth cannot be fully known, while God is not fully revealed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">No man</span>] Not even Moses. Until we see ‘face to face’ (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>) our knowledge is only partial. Symbolical visions, such as <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-23.htm" title="And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.">Exodus 33:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm" title="And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.

Most MSS. and versions have ‘the only-begotten Son’ or ‘only-begotten Son.’ But the three oldest and best MSS. and two others of great value have ‘only-begotten <span class="ital">God</span>.’ The test of the value of a MS., or group of MSS., on any disputed point, is the extent to which it admits false readings on other points not disputed. Judged by this test the group of MSS. which read ‘only-begotten God’ is very strong; while the far larger group of MSS. which have ‘Son’ for ‘God’ is comparatively weak, for the same group of MSS. might be quoted in defence of a multitude of readings which no one would think of adopting. Again, the revised Syriac, which is among the minority of versions that support ‘God,’ is here of special weight, because it agrees with MSS. from which it usually differs. We conclude, therefore, that the very unusual expression ‘only-begotten God’ is the true reading, which has been changed to the usual ‘only-begotten Son,’ a change which in an old Greek MS. would involve the alteration of only a single letter. Both readings can be traced up to the second century, which again is evidence that the Gospel was written in the first century. Such differences take time to spread themselves widely. See on <span class="ital"><a href="/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a></span> and <a href="/john/9-35.htm" title="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?">John 9:35</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the bosom</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">into</span> <span class="ital">the bosom</span>, which may mean that the return to glory after the Ascension is meant.

Abraham, Israel, Moses, Manoah, David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, saw visions, local manifestations, anticipations of the Incarnation; but the apostle here takes the Lord's own word for it (<a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>), and he elsewhere repeats it (<a href="/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>). These were but forerunners of the ultimate manifestation of the Logos. "The Glory of the Lord," "the Angel of the Lord," "the Word of the Lord," were not so revealed to patriarchs that they saw God as God. They saw him in the form of light, or of spiritual agency, or of human ministries; but in the deepest sense we must still wait for the purity of heart which will reveal to our weakened faculties the beatific vision. <span class="cmt_word">The only begotten Son</span> - or, (God <span class="accented">only begotten</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">who is in</span> (or, <span class="accented">on</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the bosom of the Father, he interpreted</span> (him); became the satisfying Exposition, the Declarer, drawing forth from the depths of God all that it is  possible that we shall see, know, or realize. This lofty assertion is augmented by the sublime intensification of the earlier phrase, "with God (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)," by (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), "in or on the bosom of the Father;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in most intimate and loving fellowship with the Father as the only begotten. The relations of fatherhood and sonship within the substance of the Godhead give new life, warmth, realization, to the vaster, colder, more metaphysical, metaphenomenal relations of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. here <a href="/proverbs/8-30.htm">Proverbs 8:30</a>). Bengel here says, "In lumbis esse dicuntur qui nascentur homines, in sinu sunt qui nati sunt. In sinu Patris erat Filius, quia nunquam non-natus." In view of the contention of Meyer that the language here refers to no age long, eternal indwelling of the Logos with, or of the Son (God only begotten) on the bosom of, the Father, but to the exaltation of the Christ after his ascension, we can only refer to the present tense (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>), which from the standpoint of the prologue does not transfer itself to the historical standpoint of the writer at the end of the first century. Lange thinks that the whole of this wonderful utterance is attributed by the evangelist to the Baptist; but the standing of the Baptist, lofty as it is in John's Gospel, after the Baptist came into brief fellowship with the One who was before him, certainly falls short of this insight into his eternal Being. John the beloved disciple could thus speak of the revelation and interpretation of God which was made in the life, words, and death of the Only Begotten, from whose fulness he had received "grace for grace;" but in this verse he is speaking of the timeless condition, the eternal fellowship, of the Only Begotten with the Father, as justifying the fulness of the revelation made in his incarnation. The prologue forms a key to the entire Gospel. It may have been written after the record of the central principles involved in the life work of Jesus had been completed. Every statement in it may be seen to be derived from the recorded words or acts of the Lord, the revelation of the Father in time, the unveiling of the eternal heart of him who made all things, and by one competent to speak of both eternities. The writer of the prologue speaks of himself as one of a group or society who had had ocular evidence of the perfection and glory of the manifestation. This fellowship of men had found themselves children of God, and in the possession of a life, a light, and a hope which were derived entirely from <span class="accented">Jesus Christ</span>, who is undoubtedly in a unique sense declared (though not formally defined) to be "the Word made flesh." In the subsequent narrative we find a graduated series of instructions on the powers of Christ and the opposition of the world to his self-manifestation. Thus (ch. 1.) the testimony of the Baptist (made after his contact with Christ) to the Person and work of the Lord attributes to him, on prophetic authority, most stupendous functions - those of baptizing with the Holy Spirit, and taking away the sin of the world. He does himself reveal the way to the Father. He is hailed as the "Christ," the "King of Israel," and as the link between heaven and earth, between the invisible and visible, the Divine and the human (<a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>). In ch. 2, with all its other suggestiveness, Christ displays his creative power, and (cf. ch. 6.) his relation to the world of things, as well as his organic relation to the old covenant. In ch. 2 his "body" is the "temple" of God, where his Father dwelt, thus justifying the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 14. The pre-existence of Christ as a self-conscious personality in the very substance of Deity is asserted by himself in <a href="/john/6-62.htm">John 6:62</a>; <a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>. The fact that he is the Source of all <span class="accented">life</span> (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>), is involved in the teaching of the Gospel from end to end. Eternal life is ministered through him, to believers (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, etc., John 3:36). He claims to have life in himself (<a href="/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>). He is the "Bread of life" for starving humanity (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35, 48</a>). The words that he speaks are spirit and <span class="accented">life</span> (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). In <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a> the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> links the idea of life and light as they are shown to cohere in the prologue. In <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a> he declares himself to be "the Truth and the Life," thus sustaining the great generalization. By raising Lazarus he is portrayed  as the Restorer of forfeited life, as well as the original Giver of life to men (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). The ninth chapter records the symbolic event by which he proved himself to be the Sun of the spiritual universe, "the Light of the world" (cf. <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a> with John 8:12; cf. <a href="/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36, 46</a>). The whole history of the conflict with the people whom he came to save, with "his own," with the world power, and the death doom, is the material which is generalized in the solemn statements of <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-10</a>. The prologue says nothing in express words of Christ's supernatural conception, of his death, or of his resurrection and eternal glory; yet these objective facts are woven through, and involved in, the entire context, for the incarnation of the Eternal Word is the historic basis of the apostle's experience of such a life as that which he proceeds to sketch. The absolute antagonism of the darkness to the light, and the rejection of the light and life by the world, never had such exposition as that which the repudiation and crucifixion of the Son of God gave to them; while the eternal nature of the central life and being of him who, when incarnate, was thus resisted by unbelief renders the resurrection and ultimate and eternal glory a necessity of thought even to these who have not yet seen, but yet have believed. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>No man hath seen God at any time (&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>God is first in the Greek order, as emphatic: "God hath no man ever seen." As to the substance of the statement, compare <a href="/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>. Manifestations of God to Old Testament saints were only partial and approximate (<a href="/exodus/33-23.htm">Exodus 33:23</a>). The seeing intended here is seeing of the divine essence rather than of the divine person, which also is indicated by the absence of the article from &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;, God. In this sense even Christ was not seen as God. The verb &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;, to see, denotes a physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment accompanying it, and points to the result rather than to the act of vision. In <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14</a>, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is used, denoting calm and deliberate contemplation (see on <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/john/12-45.htm">John 12:45</a>, we have &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to behold (see on <a href="/mark/5-15.htm">Mark 5:15</a>; see on <a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>). Both &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; and &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; imply deliberate contemplation, but the former is gazing with a view to satisfy the eye, while the latter is beholding more critically, with an inward spiritual or mental interest in the thing beheld, and with a view to acquire knowledge about it. "&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; would be used of a general officially reviewing or inspecting an army; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of a lay spectator looking at the parade" (Thayer).<p>The only begotten son (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Several of the principal manuscripts and a great mass of ancient evidence support the reading &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, "God only begotten."<p>Another and minor difference in reading relates to the article, which is omitted from &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; by most of the authorities which favor &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;. Whether we read the only begotten Son, or God only begotten, the sense of the passage is not affected. The latter reading merely combines in one phrase the two attributes of the word already indicated - God (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>), only begotten (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>); the sense being one who was both God and only begotten.<p>Who is in the bosom (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The expression &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c9;&#787;&#768;&#x3bd;, who is, or the one being, is explained in two ways: 1. As a timeless present, expressing the inherent and eternal relation of the Son to the Father. 2. As interpreted by the preposition. &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;, in, literally, into, and expressing the fact of Christ's return to the Father's glory after His incarnation: "The Son who has entered into the Father's bosom and is there." In the former case it is an absolute description of the nature of the Son: in the latter, the emphasis is on the historic fact of the ascension, though with a reference to his eternal abiding with the Father from thenceforth.<p>While the fact of Christ's return to the Father's glory may have been present to the writer's mind, and have helped to determine the form of the statement, to emphasize that fact in this connection would seem less consistent with the course of thought in the Prologue than the other interpretation: since John is declaring in this sentence the competency of the incarnate Son to manifest God to mankind. The ascension of Christ is indeed bound up with that truth, but is not, in the light of the previous course of thought, its primary factor. That is rather the eternal oneness of the Word with God; which, though passing through the phase of incarnation, nevertheless remains unbroken (<a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>). Thus Godet, aptly: "The quality attributed to Jesus, of being the perfect revealer of the divine Being, is founded on His intimate and perfect relation to God Himself."<p>The phrase, in the bosom of the Father, depicts this eternal relation as essentially a relation of love; the figure being used of the relation of husband and wife (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>); of a father to an infant child (<a href="/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>), and of the affectionate protection and rest afforded to Lazarus in Paradise (<a href="/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23</a>). The force of the preposition &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;, into, according to the first interpretation of who is, is akin to that of "with God" (see on <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>); denoting an ever active relation, an eternal going forth and returning to the Father's bosom by the Son in His eternal work of love. He ever goes forth from that element of grace and love and returns to it. That element is His life. He is there "because He plunges into it by His unceasing action" (Godet).<p>He (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Strongly emphatic, and pointing to the eternal Son. This pronoun is used by John more frequently than by any other writer. It occurs seventy-two times, and not only as denoting the more distant subject, but as denoting and laying special stress on the person or thing immediately at hand, or possessing pre-eminently the quality which is immediately in question. Thus Jesus applies it to Himself as the person for whom the healed blind man is inquiring: "It is He (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) that talketh with thee" (<a href="/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a>). So here, "the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father - He hath declared Him."<p>Hath declared (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>Or, rendering the aorist strictly, He declared. From &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;, forth, and &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to lead the way. Originally, to lead or govern. Hence, like the Latin praeire verbis, to go before with words, to prescribe or dictate a form of words. To draw out in narrative, to recount or rehearse (see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, and on <a href="/luke/24-35.htm">Luke 24:35</a>). To relate in full; to interpret, or translate. Therefore &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, exegesis, is interpretation or explanation. The word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2; was used by the Greeks of an expounder of oracles, dreams, omens, or sacred rites. Thus Croesus, finding the suburbs of Sardis alive with serpents, sent to the soothsayers (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;) of Telmessus (Herodotus, i. 78). The word thus comes to mean a spiritual director. Plato calls Apollo the tutelary director (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;) of religion ("Republic," 427), and says, "Let the priests be interpreters for life" ("Laws," 759). In the Septuagint the word is used of the magicians of Pharaoh's court (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>, <a href="/genesis/41-24.htm">Genesis 41:24</a>), and the kindred verb of teaching or interpreting concerning leprosy (<a href="/leviticus/14-57.htm">Leviticus 14:57</a>). John's meaning is that the Word revealed or manifested and interpreted the Father to men. The word occurs only here in John's writings. Wyc. renders, He hath told out. These words conclude the Prologue.<p>The Historical Narrative now begins, and falls into two general divisions:<p>continued...</body></html>
