The paschal lamb, in the shedding and sprinkling of its blood, the roasting and eating of its flesh, and all the other circumstances of the ordinance, represented the salvation of sinners by faith in Christ. And the lambs sacrificed every morning and evening, can only refer to Christ slain as a sacrifice to redeem us to God by his blood. John came as a preacher of repentance, yet he told his followers that they were to look for the pardon of their sins to Jesus only, and to his death. It agrees with God's glory to pardon all who depend on the atoning sacrifice of Christ. He takes away the sin of the world; purchases pardon for all that repent and believe the gospel. This encourages our faith; if Christ takes away the sin of the world, then why not my sin? He bore sin for us, and so bears it from us. God could have taken away sin, by taking away the sinner, as he took away the sin of the old world; but here is a way of doing away sin, yet sparing the sinner, by making his Son sin, that is, a sin-offering, for us. See Jesus taking away sin, and let that cause hatred of sin, and resolutions against it. Let us not hold that fast, which the Lamb of God came to take away. To confirm his testimony concerning Christ, John declares the appearance at his baptism, in which God himself bore witness to him. He saw and bare record that he is the Son of God. This is the end and object of John's testimony, that Jesus was the promised Messiah. John took every opportunity that offered to lead people to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bare record - Gave testimony.<p>I saw the Spirit ... - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31-34. knew him not&#8212;Living mostly apart, the one at Nazareth, the other in the Judean desert&#8212;to prevent all appearance of collusion, John only knew that at a definite time after his own call, his Master would show Himself. As He drew near for baptism one day, the last of all the crowd, the spirit of the Baptist heaving under a divine presentiment that the moment had at length arrived, and an air of unwonted serenity and dignity, not without traits, probably, of the family features, appearing in this Stranger, the Spirit said to him as to Samuel of his youthful type, "Arise, anoint Him, for this is He!"

This was, indeed, a necessary condition before he could make the <span class="greekheb">φανέρωσις</span> to the people. This explanation he now gives in the following testimony (not first spoken upon another occasion, Ewald) concerning the divine <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span>, <span class="ital">which he beheld</span>. And the evangelist considers this testimony so weighty, that he does not simply continue the words of the Baptist, but solemnly and emphatically introduces the testimony as such: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐμαρτύρησεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., words which are not therefore parenthetical (Bengel, Lücke, and most), but from an impressive part of the record: “And a testimony did John bear, when he said.” The following <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> simply <span class="ital">recitative</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τεθέαμαι</span>] <span class="ital">I have seen;</span> Perfect, like <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακα</span> in <a href="/john/1-34.htm" title="And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.">John 1:34</a>, which see.

This is in answer to Baur, p. 104 ff., according to whom there is no room here for the supposition that Jesus was baptized by John,—an assertion all the more groundless, because if we insert the baptism of Jesus before <a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a>, there is no place in the plan of this Gospel for the narration of a fact which is assumed as universally known.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">sight itself</span> here spoken of was no mere production of the imagination, but a <span class="ital">real sight;</span> it indicates an actual <span class="ital">event</span> divinely brought about, which was traditionally worked up by the Synoptics into a visible occurrence more or less objective (most unhesitatingly by Luke), but which can be the subject of <span class="ital">testimony</span> only by virtue of a <span class="greekheb">θεωρία νοητική</span> (Origen).

In what sense did the Baptist “see” the Spirit descending? Origen distinctly declared that these words <span class="greekheb">οἰκονομὶας τρόπῳ γέγραπται οὐχ ἱστορικὴν διήγησιν ἔχοντα ἀλλὰ θεωρίαν νοητήν</span>, ii. 239. The <span class="greekheb">ὡς περιστερὰν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ</span> does not necessarily involve that an actual dove was visible. It was not the dove which was to be the sign; but, as the Baptist affirms in <a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>, the descent and abiding of the Spirit. John was scarcely the type of man who would be determined in an important course of action by the appearance of a bird. What he saw was the Spirit descending. This he can best have seen in the demeanour of Jesus, in His lowliness and sympathy and holiness, all of which came to their perfect bloom at and in His baptism. It was the possession of this spirit by Jesus that convinced John that He could baptise with the Holy Spirit. That this conviction came to him at the baptism of Christ with a clearness and firmness which authenticated it as divine is guaranteed by the words of this verse. It was as plain to him that Jesus was possessed by the Spirit as if he had seen the Spirit in a visible shape alighting upon Him. To a mind absorbed in this one idea it may have actually seemed as if he saw it with his bodily eyes. Ambrose, <span class="ital">De Sacram.</span>, i., 5, “Spiritus autem sanctus non in veritate columbae, sed in specie columbae descendit de coelo”. The dove was in the East a sacred bird, and the brooding dove was symbolic of the quickening warmth of nature. In Jewish writings the Spirit hovering over the primeval waters is expressly compared to a dove: “Spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas, sicut columba, quae fertur super pullos suos nec tangit illos”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also Noah’s dove as symbol of the new creation. (See Suicer, <span class="ital">s.v.</span>, <span class="greekheb">περιστερά</span>, and Strauss, i., 362.) Such a symbol of the Spirit would scarcely have been imagined by the Baptist, who was all for stern and violent methods.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">bare record</span>] Better, <span class="ital">bare</span> <span class="bld">witness</span>; comp. <span class="ital"><a href="/context/john/1-7.htm" title="The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe....">John 1:7-8</a>; <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a>; <a href="/john/1-34.htm" title="And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.">John 1:34</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I saw</span>] Better, <span class="ital">I</span> <span class="bld">have beheld</span>, or <span class="ital">contemplated</span> (<a href="/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time.

A real appearance is the natural meaning here and is insisted on by S. Luke (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm" title="And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove on him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.">Luke 3:22</a>). And if we admit the ‘bodily shape’ at all, there can be no sound reason for rejecting the dove. The marvel is that the Holy Spirit should be visible in any way (comp. ‘the tongues of fire,’ <a href="/acts/2-3.htm" title="And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them.">Acts 2:3</a>), not that He should assume the form of a dove in particular. Of course this visible descent of the Spirit made no change in the nature of Christ. It served two purposes, (1) to make the Messiah known to the Baptist, and through him to the world; (2) to mark the official commencement of the ministry of the Messiah, like the anointing of a king. The whole incident is very parallel to the Transfiguration. In both Christ is miraculously glorified previous to setting out to suffer; in both a voice from heaven bears witness to Him; at both ‘the goodly fellowship of the Prophets’ is nobly represented.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.">John 1:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐμαρτύρησεν</span>, <span class="ital">bare record</span>) as concerning a fact seen by himself and not by the people. The words which follow [comp. <a href="/john/1-34.htm" title="And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.">John 1:34</a>] were part of his record [testimony]: the words which are spoken, <a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>, etc. [comp. <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>], were part of his demonstration [the clear proof of Jesus’ Messiahship, which John demonstrated] from the record. The Evangelist interposes this in the midst of the connected words of the Baptist, as a sort of parenthesis; <span class="greekheb">ἐμαρτύρησεν</span>—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">John bare record, saying</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τεθέαμαι</span>) <span class="ital">I beheld</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξούρανοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">from heaven</span>) Construe this with <span class="greekheb">καταβαῖνον</span>, <span class="ital">descending.

There can be no reasonable doubt that the evangelist makes reference to the synoptic tradition of the baptism of Jesus by John, although it may suit some uncompromising opponents of the Fourth Gospel to say that the baptism is here omitted. The act of the rite is not <span class="accented">totidem verbis</span> described; but the chief accompaniment and real meaning of the baptism is specially portrayed. All the well known cycles of criticism make their special assault on the narratives at this point. Rationalism finds in a thunderstorm and the casual flight of a pigeon what John magnified into a supernatural portent; Straussianism sees the  growth of a legend from prepared sources of Hebrew tradition, and endeavours to aggravate into irreconcilable discrepancy the various accounts; Baur and Hilgenfeld accentuate the objectively supernatural portent, so as the more easily to put it into the region of ignorant superstition; others find the hint or sign of Gnostic handling; and Keim suggests that it is the poetic colouring which a later age unconsciously attributed to the Baptist and the Christ. Let it be noticed: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the present Gospel does not augment, but diminishes, the miraculous element as compared with the synoptic narrative. The 'Gospel of the Hebrews ' added further embellishments still. Our Gospel compels us to believe that the <span class="accented">mind of the Baptist</span> was the chief region of the miracle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The author of this Gospel might, if he had chosen, have selected his own experience on the Mount of Transfiguration in vindication of a Divine attestation of the Sonship; but he preferred to fall back upon the testimony of his revered master. Peter, James, and <span class="accented">John</span> were <span class="accented">unprepared</span> for what they saw and heard on that occasion; and Peter knew not what he said, so great was the awful wonder that fell upon him then. Here, however, is recorded a vision for which the mind of the great forerunner <span class="accented">was</span> prepared. He expected to see the Spirit of God in some manner blend his energy with that of the individual who would prove to be the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> John does not discriminate the methods of the two communications, and from this narrative all that could be inferred positively is that the mind of John, by objective or subjective process, of which we know nothing, received the communication and the sacred impression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The synoptic narrative, <span class="accented">prima facie</span>, differs from this representation. At all events <a href="/luke/3-21.htm">Luke 3:21, 22</a> speaks of "opened heavens," "the Holy Spirit in bodily form as a dove," and a voice addressed to the Lord, "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased." This account is taken by Strauss as the key to the other three, and he urges that they must all be interpreted in harmony with it. But from the time of Origen, the exegesis of <span class="accented">Matthew's</span> account no less emphatically states (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> if with De Wette, Bleck, Baur, and Keim, we take <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3c9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> as the subject of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) that John <span class="accented">saw</span> the Holy Spirit descending like a dove and coming upon (Christ) him, and that the voice was addressed to John, "This is my beloved Son," etc. In Mark's account the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> are susceptible of the same interpretation. It should be observed that Luke's narrative clearly implies that our Lord's baptism took place at some unspecified opportunity, and simply gives the summing up of the impression produced upon the mind of John. It is more reasonable to interpret Luke in harmony with the main conception of Matthew and John than to press the latter into forced harmony with the former. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The great difficulty is the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. But surely the prophetic mind was accustomed to dwell in the midst of similar visual shapes of spiritual things. There was <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> enough in the cherubim, olive trees, horses, armies, vials, and cities of the Apocalypse, and there were "voices" heard by Ezekiel, Hosea, Elijah, and by John himself which could be, were, and even must be, described in terms of physical facts, which no interpreters have ever felt compelled to transfer into the region of phenomena. There are still intensely vivid intuitions of spiritual fact which transcend all sensible or logical proof. If John saw and heard these things so far as his own consciousness was concerned, there is enough to account for every peculiarity of the narrative. He saw the Shechinah glory hovering over the Lord Jesus, officially consecrating a human personality. The dove<span class="accented">like</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>) form and motion taken by the heavenly light reminded him of the brooding of the Spirit of God upon the primaeval waters. He looked into the face of the Holy One of God - majesty and meekness, Divine glory, human gentleness, a sanctity as of the holy place, a freedom as of the birds of heaven, force like that of the steeds of the rising sun, inward peace like the calm of a brooding dove, transfigured the Lord. This dovelike splendour abode upon him, <span class="accented">passed into him</span>; and the voice (the invincible conviction, the resistless consciousness that often can find no other expression than "Thus saith the Lord") was heard, "This is my beloved Son," etc. We cannot say what John saw; we know what he said; and it covered the consciousness of the most stupendous reality yet enacted on the earth. That which John had been taught to predict as approaching was now seen to have actually come about, he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost has commenced his wondrous mission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The whole question as to the relation of the Holy Spirit and the Logos - the relation between the statement of ver. 13 and vers. 31-33 - demands special consideration. A few words here may suffice. Baur, Eichhorn, and others have urged that either the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are identical, and that that which John means (vers. 1-14) by the <span class="accented">Logos</span> he afterwards resolves into the <span class="accented">pneuma</span>, or that this scene and these words are incompatible with the prologue. It is true that Philo and Justin ('Apol.,' 1:33) do use the two terms as practically identical. But John has recorded our Lord's own words as to the antithesis of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> (ch. 3.), declaring in his prologue that the Logos is the Source of all the life  and light of men, and that the Logos came into the world and became flesh. Now, if John did not abide firmly in this thought, he would have represented incarnate God as undergoing the process of regeneration at his baptism, than which nothing would be more abhorrent to his entire theory of the Christ. The relations of the Logos and the Pneuma to each other and to the Father, metaphysically considered, are profoundly intricate, but the relations of Father, Word, and Holy Spirit to the Person of the Lord Jesus have been several times asserted by the apostles, and cannot be interchanged (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 5; Lucke, 'Comm. uber d. Evang. Joh.,' vol. 1. pp. 433-443) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Bare record (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, bear witness, as Rev.
