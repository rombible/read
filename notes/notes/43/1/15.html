Note on <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>. The writer thinks of the testimony as ever present, ever forceful. Twice on successive days had he heard them from the lips of the Baptist; three times within a few verses does he himself record them. (Comp. <a href="/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>; <a href="/john/1-30.htm" title="This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:30</a>.) They are among the words stamped on the heart in the crisis of life, and as fresh in the aged Apostle as they had been in the youthful inquirer. He remembers how he heard them, and from whom they came. That wondrous spiritual power in their midst which all men felt, whose witness men would have accepted had he declared that he was himself the Christ, uttered his witness then, and it holds good now. It is quoted here as closely bound up with the personal reminiscence of <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>, and with the thought of <a href="/context/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.">John 1:6-7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">John bare witness of him, saying, This is he, </span>&c. — “This might probably happen at the time when Jesus made his first appearance among those that came to be baptized by John; when, at his offering to receive his baptism, though John before had been a stranger to him, and knew him not by any personal acquaintance with him, yet, by some powerful impression on his mind, he presently <span class="ital">discerned </span>that <span class="ital">this was He </span>whom he before had taught the people to expect, and of whose person he had given them so high a character. For it was plainly from his knowledge of him, that John at first would have declined baptizing him as an honour of which he looked upon himself to be unworthy. Nor is it to be doubted, that when first he knew the person, of whose appearance he had raised such expectations by his preaching, he would immediately be ready to acquaint his hearers, that this was he who was intended by him; which they themselves might have been ready to conclude from the uncommon veneration and respect with which the Baptist treated him, who had been always used to treat men with the greatest plainness.” <span class="ital">He that cometh after me is preferred before me </span>— Namely, by God. “Erasmus supposes, that John here refers to the honours which he knew had been paid to Jesus in his infancy, by the angel who announced his birth to the shepherds; by the shepherds themselves; by the eastern sages; by Simeon and Anna; honours which could not be paralleled by any thing which had happened to him. But the words seem to have a more extensive meaning, comprehending the superior dignity of Christ’s nature, office, commission, and exaltation, as Mediator. See <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>, the passage here referred to. <span class="ital">For he was before me </span>— It is fit that Jesus should be raised above me, because he is a person superior in nature to me. For though he was born after me, he existed before me.” “This must undoubtedly refer to the state of glory in which Christ existed before his incarnation, of which the Baptist speaks so plainly, <a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>.” See Doddridge and Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 As to the order of time and entrance on his work, Christ came after John, but in every other way he was before him. The expression clearly shows that Jesus had existence before he appeared on earth as man. All fulness dwells in him, from which alone fallen sinners have, and shall receive, by faith, all that renders them wise, strong, holy, useful, and happy. Our receivings by Christ are all summed up in this one word, grace; we have received even grace, a gift so great, so rich, so invaluable; the good will of God towards us, and the good work of God in us. The law of God is holy, just, and good; and we should make the proper use of it. But we cannot derive from it pardon, righteousness, or strength. It teaches us to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, but it cannot supply the place of that doctrine. As no mercy comes from God to sinners but through Jesus Christ, no man can come to the Father but by him; no man can know God, except as he is made known in the only begotten and beloved Son.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>John bare witness of him - The evangelist now returns to the testimony of John the Baptist. He had stated that the Word became incarnate, and he now appeals to the testimony of John to show that, thus incarnate, he was the Messiah.<p>He that cometh after me - He of whom I am the forerunner, or whose way I am come to prepare. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>.<p>Is preferred before me - Is superior to me. Most critics have supposed that the words translated "is preferred" relate to "time," and not to "dignity;" meaning that though he came after him publicly, being six months younger than John, as well as entering on his work after John, yet that he had existed long before him. Most, however, have understood it more correctly, as our translators seem to have done, as meaning, He was worthy of more honor than Iam.<p>He was before me - This can refer to nothing but his pre-existence, and can be explained only on the supposition that he existed before John, or, as the evangelist had before shown, from the beginning. He came "after" John in his public ministry and in his human nature, but in his divine nature he had existed long before John had a being - from eternity. We may learn here that it is one mark of the true spirit of a minister of Christ to desire and feel that Christ is always to be preferred to ourselves. We should keep ourselves out of view. The great object is to hold up the Saviour; and however much ministers may be honored or blessed, yet they should lay all at the feet of Jesus, and direct all men to him as the undivided object of affection and honor. It is the business of every Christian, as well as of every Christian minister, to be a witness for Christ, and to endeavor to convince the world that he is worthy of confidence and love. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Joh 1:15.

Origen long ago rightly understood both clauses as relating to time, though the second is not therefore to be rendered “He was before me” (Luther and many, also Brückner, Baeumlein), since <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> is not the word;[103] nor yet: “He <span class="ital">came into being</span> before me,” which would not be referable “to the O.

It is decisive against both, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΠΡῶΤΌς ΜΟΥ ἮΝ</span></span></span> would be tautological,—an argument which is not to be set aside by any fanciful rendering of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟς</span></span></span> (see below).

III. 1, p. 675, “my successor is my predecessor,” where, however, his assumption of a reference to <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a> is without any hint to that effect in the words. According to Luthardt (comp Hofmann, <span class="ital">Weissag. u. Erf</span>. II. 256), what is meant to be said is: “He who at first walked behind me, as if he were my <span class="ital">disciple</span>, has taken precedence of me, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> He has become my <span class="ital">master</span>.” But the enigma of the sentence lies just in this, that <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὀπίσω μου ἐρχόμ</span>. expresses something still <span class="ital">future</span>, as this also answers to the formal <span class="greekheb">ἔρχεσθαι</span> used of the Messiah’s advent.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke, describe what John the Baptist said before the baptism of Jesus: but the Evangelist John records what John the Baptist said after the baptism of Jesus, in such a way, however, that at the same time he refers himself to what had been said previously. In <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a> the expression is, <span class="greekheb">ὃν εἶπὸν</span>, <span class="ital">whom I spake of</span>, not <span class="greekheb">περὶ οὗ εἶπον</span>, <span class="ital">respecting whom I said</span>: wherefore there is no need to suppose that the <span class="ital">whole</span> subsequent discourse is here referred to, as if uttered by John before the baptism of the Lord.

In the later verses this testimony is put in its proper place. Its repetition deepens the impression which the narrative gives of the vivid reality, and of the fact that the evangelist was trusting to a strongly impressed recollection, and is not romanticizing, as the Tubingen critics suppose. The sharp paradoxical form is thoroughly characteristic of the man who called on scribes and Pharisees to "repent," and spoke of God raising up seed to Abraham from the stones of the ground. From the synoptists we learn that John declared that the Coming One was "mightier" than himself, would deal with the Holy Ghost and with fire as he was able to do with water. He knew not the kind of manifestation which was coming on apace. But an enormous change passed over John the Baptist when he came into contact with our Lord, and at his baptism he sank abashed before the revelations which flashed on his soul. The enigmatical form of the Baptist's utterances was the beginning of the evangelist's faith in the personal pre-existence of the Logos who had become flesh in Christ. The testimony of the Baptist is here brought in, as the last great word of the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament, apart from the historic setting in which it afterwards occurs, as if, moreover, it was an abiding word which was yet sounding in the ears of men. The greatest of the sons of woman, and "more than a prophet," he who gathered up in his immense personality all the functions of prophet, priest, Nazarite, and master and teacher of men, the Elijah of the new revelation - John, the very ideal of Divine and supernatural voice in this world of ours, John, the veritable historic man, moreover, to whose disastrous martyrdom some of the Jews (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18, 5, 2) referred the terrible judgments that befell their nation - <span class="cmt_word">John</span> <span class="cmt_word">beareth witness</span>. That was his function, and his testimony still stands, his "voice" is still heard wherever his great career is known or properly appreciated - in Palestine, in Alexandria, in Ephesus or Corinth. And <span class="cmt_word">he crieth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); or, <span class="accented">hath cried</span>; and the cry is still heard among men: <span class="cmt_word">This was he of whom I spake</span>; implying that John uttered words of strange enigmatical significance before he saw Jesus coming to his baptism, and that, as the evangelist subsequently shows, on two memorable occasions, the prophet recalled them and reaffirmed their truthfulness. Before I saw him, I said it: <span class="cmt_word">He that is coming after me hath become</span> - hath been in mighty activity - <span class="cmt_word">before me</span>. He came forth in many ways from the Father, and was the central reality of the old covenant; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, he hath come in the voice of the Lord, in the Shechinah glory, in the Angel of the <span class="accented">presence</span>, chronologically "before me." The English Version has followed the traditionary interpretation from Chrysostom to Lucke, De Wette, Alford, McLellan, and has seen in this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> a reference to the higher rank or dignity of the Logos <span class="accented">incarnate</span>, and translated the second clause "is preferred before me," or "hath been made before me," etc. But such a statement would not have conveyed any thought of great importance. A herald is naturally exceeded and superseded by the dignity and rank of him for whom he prepares the way. Moreover, the two adverbs of place are used in metaphorical sense as adverbs of time (derived from the relative position of individuals in a line or procession), and it is scarcely probable that the second should be used in another sense altogether, which would have disturbed the antithesis between them. On the other hand, Hengstenberg, Meyer, Lange, Godet, etc., recognize the perception of the Baptist, and his utterance of belief in the pre-existence of the Christ, and that from such passages as <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> he knew that he who was coming into the world, and about to baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire, to take the fan in his hand, etc., had been in reality <span class="accented">before him.</span> The difficulty of this interpretation is said to be that the proof which follows - <span class="cmt_word">because</span>, or <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>he was before me</span> - would be tautologous in the extreme; the reason given for the Lord having become before him being simply the asseveration of the fact. But the two very remarkable expressions, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;</span>, are not identical. The first may easily refer to the historic precedence of the activity of the Coming One in all the operations of the Logos; the second may refer to the absolute and eternal precedence of the Logos in itself. If so, the whole significance of the previous fourteen verses is gathered up, and shown to have been flashed upon the consciousness of John the Baptist, and uttered with such intensity that the evangelist caught the idea, and saw in it the key to the whole mystery. It would seem, however, that the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> did not form  part of the original utterance of John. After the baptism, the whole truth had broken upon the Baptist, and he clenched or saw an explanation of the mystery. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> is parallel to <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-5</a>, so this verse is parallel to <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6-8</a>, but with an advance of thought. <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6-8</a> set forth the Baptist's witness to the Word as the general light of men. This verse gives the Baptist's witness to the personal Word become flesh.<p>Bare witness (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>Present tense. Rev., correctly, beareth witness. The present tense describes the witness of the Baptist as abiding. The fact of the Word's becoming flesh is permanently by his testimony.<p>Cried (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a>; see on <a href="/mark/9-24.htm">Mark 9:24</a>; see on <a href="/luke/18-39.htm">Luke 18:39</a>. The verb denotes an inarticulate utterance as distinguished from words. When used is connection with articulate speech, it is joined with &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; or &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, to say, as <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/7-28.htm">Luke 7:28</a>, cried, saying. Compare <a href="/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>; <a href="/luke/12-44.htm">Luke 12:44</a>. The crying corresponds with the Baptist's description of himself as a voice (&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;, sound or tone), <a href="/mark/1-3.htm">Mark 1:3</a>; <a href="/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4</a>; <a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a>. The verb is in the perfect tense, but with the usual classical sense of the present.<p>Was He (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The imperfect tense, pointing back to a testimony historically past.<p>After me (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Literally, behind me: in His human manifestation.<p>Is preferred before me (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Literally, "is become," so Rev., "or is here (compare <a href="/john/6-25.htm">John 6:25</a>) before me." Before is used of time, not of dignity or rank. The expression is enigmatical in form: "my successor is my predecessor." The idea of the superior dignity of Christ is not a necessary inference from His coming after John, as, on that interpretation, the words would imply. On the contrary, the herald who precedes is inferior in dignity to the Prince whom he announces.<p>For (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Or because. The reason for the preceding statement: the key to the enigma.<p>He was before me (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>continued...</body></html>
