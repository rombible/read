In support of this the etymology of Bethabara (= “ford-house”) is compared with a possible meaning of Bethany (= “ship-house”), and the two are regarded as popular names of some well-known ford, one of which gradually ceased to be known as the name of this place, because it became appropriated as a name of the Bethany made prominent in the closing scenes of our Lord’s life. On the other hand, it is believed that this argument from etymology is at least precarious; that ignorance of the place after three hundred years—and these years of war and unsettlement—is not unnatural; that the tradition in favour of Bethabara, which was then a favourite place for baptism, is one likely to have grown with this fact; and that we are not justified in adopting the critical decision of Origen, who rejected the almost unanimous evidence of MSS. in favour of this tradition at second hand. We are, moreover, ignorant of the site of Bethabara, and the identification with either Beth-barah (<a href="/judges/7-24.htm" title="And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.">Judges 7:24</a>), or Beth-nimrah (<a href="/numbers/32-36.htm" title="And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.">Numbers 32:36</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm" title="And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.">Joshua 13:27</a>), which in some readings of the LXX. had taken the forms <span class= "ital">Bethabra</span> and <span class= "ital">Betharaba,</span> gives a position much too far to the south, for the writer is clearly speaking of a place within easy approach of Galilee (<a href="/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a> and <a href="/john/2-1.htm" title="And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:">John 2:1</a>), and he is careful to note the succession of days and even hours. It is not inconsistent with this that the narrative in <a href="/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a> and <a href="/mark/1-5.htm" title="And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.">Mark 1:5</a> seems to require a place of easy access from Jerusalem, for the positions are not necessarily the same, and the account there is of a general impression, while here we have the minute details of an eye-witness. Himself a disciple of John, he remembers the place where he was then dwelling and baptising, and he knows that this Bethany is “beyond Jordan,” just as he knows that the other is “the town of Mary and her sister Martha” (<a href="/john/11-1.htm" title="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.">John 11:1</a>), and that it “was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off (<a href="/john/11-18.htm" title="Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:">John 11:18</a>). Dr. Caspari believes that a “Bethany” answering the demands of the context is to be found in the village <span class= "ital">Tellanîje</span> or <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> which is in the Iolan to the north of the Sea of Galilee (comp. <a href="/john/10-40.htm" title="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.">John 10:40</a>). It is near a ford of the Jordan, with several brooks intervening. The identity of name depends upon the frequent substitution by the Arabs of “Tell” (= “hill”) for “Beth” (=“house”), so that the present word represents Beth-anîje, or Bethany. Dr. Caspari’s statement is now accessible to the English reader. Few, perhaps, will fully accept the author’s opinion, “With regard to the accuracy of our conclusion respecting the site, there can, therefore, be no doubt” (<span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd.,</span> p. 93), but it is based upon a reading of which there can be no doubt, and is, at least, a probable interpretation.<p>We have in these verses also a note of time. John now knows the Messiah, though others do not. This inquiry of the legates from Jerusalem was, therefore,, after the baptism of our Lord (<a href="/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>; <a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>), and if so, after the Temptation also.

He came in the spirit and power of Elias, but he was not the person of Elias. John was not that Prophet whom Moses said the Lord would raise up to them of their brethren, like unto him. He was not such a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans. He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them to hearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession of repentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to be conferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, though they knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanest service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In Bethabara - Almost all the ancient manuscripts and versions, instead of "Bethabara" here, have "Bethany," and this is doubtless the true reading. There was a Bethany about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, but there is said also to have been another in the tribe of Reuben, on the east side of the river Jordan, and in this place, probably, John was baptizing. It is about 12 miles above Jericho. The word "Bethabara" means "house or place of a ford." The reading "Bethabara," instead of "Bethany," seems to have arisen from the conjecture of Origen, who found in his day no such place as "Bethany," but saw a town called "Bethabara," where John was said to have baptized, and therefore took the liberty of changing the former reading - Robinson, Lexicon.<p>Beyond Jordan - On the east side of the Jordan River. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28.

That is, this testimony was bore by John; and this discourse passed between him and the Pharisees, at the place here mentioned; which was a passage over Jordan, where much people walked to go on the other side, <p>beyond Jordan; and  <p>where also John was baptizing; which brought a great concourse of people together: so that this witness was bore in a very public manner, and before a large number; and it is to this that Christ refers, in <a href="/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a> for this was so well known, that there was no hiding or denying it: the place where this conversation passed, is in the Vulgate Latin, and all the eastern versions; and in the Alexandrian copy, and many other copies, and so in Nonnus, called Bethany; but as De Dieu observes, Bethany was not beyond Jordan, nor in the wilderness of Judea, but near to Jerusalem, about two miles distant from it; nor was it situated by waters convenient for baptizing, unless they went to the brook Kidron, which indeed was not far from it; but it is clear from the history, that John was not so near Jerusalem; nor did that brook which might be forded over, continues the same learned author, seem fit and proper enough, `"mergendis baptizandorum corporibus", for plunging the bodies of those that were to be baptized'; wherefore he rightly concludes, that either this reading is an error, or there was another Bethany near Jordan: Bethabara signifies "the house of passage", and is thought to be the place where the Israelites passed over Jordan, to go into the land of Canaan, <a href="/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>. And which, as it must be a very convenient place for the administration of baptism by immersion, used by John, so it was very significant of the use of this ordinance; which is, as it were, the passage, or entrance, into the Gospel church state; for persons ought first to be baptized, and then be admitted into a Gospel church, according to the example of the primitive Christians, <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a> but whether there was a place of this name, where the Israelites went over Jordan, is not certain; and if there was, it does not seem so likely to be the place here designed, since that was right over against Jericho; whereas this seems to be rather further off, and over against Galilee: there were several passages of Jordan, <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>. There was a bridge over it, between the lake of Samochon and Gennesaret, now called Jacob's bridge, where Jacob is supposed to have wrestled with the angel, and to have met with his brother Esau; and there was another over it at Chainmath, near Tiberias, and in other places: and it might be at one of these passages, by which they went over into Galilee, that John pitched upon to continue preaching and baptizing at; partly because of the number of people that went over, to whom he had the opportunity of preaching; and partly, for the sake of baptizing those who became proper subjects of that ordinance through his ministry. Some have thought, that this place is the same with Bethbarah, in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24</a>, which was either in the tribe of Ephraim or of Manasseh, and not far from the parts where this place must be, but was on this side Jordan; and so Beza says the words should be rendered; and those who came to John at Jordan, are not said to pass over that river: others are of opinion, that Bethabara is the same with Betharabah, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-6.htm">Joshua 15:6</a>, since this is called Bethabara by the Septuagint, in <a href="/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>. However, be it what place soever, and wheresoever, it was no doubt very proper for John's purpose; and therefore he chose it, and for a while continued at it: and here, says Jerom (a). <p>"to this day many of the brethren, that is, of the number of believers, desiring there to be born again, are baptized in the vital stream; <p>such veneration had they for the place where John first baptized: Origen says (b), that in his time it was said, that Bethabara was showed by the banks of Jordan, where they report John baptized, <p>(a) De Locis Hebraicis, fol. 89.

On account of the importance of His public appearance, a definite statement of its locality is again given.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A place so exactly described by John himself (<a href="/john/11-18.htm" title="Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:">John 11:18</a>), according to its situation, <span class="ital">as Bethany on the Mount of Olives</span>, cannot be meant here; there must also have been another Bethany situated in Peraea, probably only a village, of which nothing further is known from history. Origen, investigating both the locality and the text, did not find indeed any Bethany, but a Bethabara instead[114] (comp. <a href="/judges/7-24.htm" title="And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.">Jdg 7:24</a>?), which the legends of his day described as the place of baptism; the legend, however, misled him. For Bethany in Peraea could not have been situated at all in the same latitude with Jericho, as the tradition represents, but must have lain much farther north; for Jesus occupied about three days in travelling thence to the Judaean Bethany for the raising of Lazarus (see on <a href="/john/11-17.htm" title="Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.">John 11:17</a>). Yet Paulus (following Bolten) understood the place to be Bethany on the Mount of Olives, and puts a period after <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span>, in spite of the facts that <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐπαύριον</span> (comp. <a href="/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;">John 1:35</a>) must begin the new narration, and that <span class="greekheb">ὅπου ἦν Ἰωάνν</span>. <span class="greekheb">βαπτ</span>. must clearly refer to <a href="/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a> ff. Baur, however, makes the name, which according to Schenkel must be attributed to an error of a non-Jewish author, to have been <span class="ital">invented</span>, in order to represent Jesus (?) as <span class="ital">beginning</span> His public ministry at a <span class="ital">Bethany</span>, seeing that He came out of a <span class="ital">Bethany</span> at its close. Against the objection still taken to this name even by Weizsäcker (a name which a third person was certainly least of all likely to venture to insert, seeing that Bethany on the Mount of Olives was so well known), see Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>.

J. II. 461,—is all the more untenable, seeing that this etymology is not at all appropriate to the position of Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Origen himself explains the name Bethabara with an evident intention to allegorize: <span class="greekheb">οἷχος χατασχευῆς</span> (ברא). The derivation of the name Bethany (Lightfoot: בֵּית הינֵי, house of dates; Simon: בֵּית עֲנִיָּה, locus depressionis; others: בֵּיח עֲנִיָה domus miseri) is doubtful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Note</span>.—(1.)

Wieseler, Ebrard, Luthardt, Godet, and most expositors, as already Lücke, Tholuck, De Wette, following the older expositors, rightly regard the events of <a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a> ff. as <span class="ital">subsequent</span> to the baptism. It is futile to appeal, as against this (Brückner), to the “<span class="ital">indefiniteness</span>” of the words <span class="greekheb">ὃν ὑμεῖς οὐκ οἴδατε</span>, for there is really no indefiniteness in them; while to refer them to a merely preliminary knowledge, in opposition to the <span class="ital">definite</span> acquaintance which began at the baptism, is (against Hengstenberg) a mere subterfuge. That even after the baptism, which had already taken place, John could say, “Ye know Him not,” is sufficiently conceivable, if we adhere to the purely historical account of the baptism, as given in <a href="/context/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water....">John 1:31-34</a>. See on Matt. p. 111 ff. (2.) Although, according to <a href="/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14</a>, John already knows Jesus as the Messiah when He came to be baptized of him, there is in this only an apparent discrepancy between the two evangelists, see on <a href="/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>.

(4.) The testimonies borne by the Baptist, as recorded in the Synoptics, are, both as to time (<span class="ital">before</span> the baptism) and occasion, very different from that recorded in <a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a> ff., which was given before a deputation from the high court; and therefore the historic truth of both accounts is to be retained side by side,[115] though in details John (against Weisse, who attributes the narrative in John to another hand; so Baur and others) must be taken as the standard. (5.) To deny any reference in <a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a> ff. to the baptism of Jesus (Baur), is quite irreconcilable with <a href="/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>; <a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>; for the evangelist could not but take it for granted that the baptism of Jesus (which indeed Weisse, upon the whole, questions) was a well-known fact. (6.) Definite as is the reference to the baptism of Jesus, there is not to be found any allusion whatever in John’s account to the history of the temptation with its forty days, which can be brought in only before <a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a>, and even then involving a contradiction with the Synoptics. The total absence of any mention of this—important as it would have been in connection with the baptism, and with John’s design generally in view of his idea of the Logos (against B. Crusius)—does not certainly favour the reality of its historic truth as an actual and outward event. Comp. Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> p. 154. If the baptism of Jesus be placed between tbe two testimonies of <a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a> ff. and <a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a> ff. (so Hilgenfeld and Brückner, following Olshausen, B. Crusius, and others), which would oblige us still to place it on the day of the first testimony (see Brückner), though Baumlein (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1846, p. 389) would leave this uncertain; then the history of the temptation is as good as <span class="ital">expressly</span> excluded by John, because it must find its place (<a href="/mark/1-12.htm" title="And immediately the spirit drives him into the wilderness.">Mark 1:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>; <a href="/luke/4-1.htm" title="And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,">Luke 4:1</a>) immediately after the baptism. In opposition to this view, Hengstenberg puts it in the period after <a href="/john/3-22.htm" title="After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.">John 3:22</a>, which is only an unavailing makeshift.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[115] Keim, <span class="ital">Gesch. J</span>. I. p. 522, sees in John’s account <span class="ital">not so much an historical narrative</span>, as rather (?) a “very <span class="ital">significant</span> literary <span class="ital">introduction</span> to the Baptist, who to <span class="ital">a certain extent</span> (?) is officially declaring himself. According to Scholten, the Baptist, during his ministry, did not at all recognise Jesus as Messiah, and <a href="/context/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?...">Matthew 3:14-15</a> is said to be an addition to the text of Mark;” while the fourth Gospel does not relate the baptism of Jesus, but only mentions the revelation from heaven then made, because to narrate the former would not be appropriate to the Gnosis of the Logos.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα ἐν Βηθανίᾳ</span> … <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζων</span>. The place is mentioned on account of the importance of the testimony thus borne to Jesus, and because the evangelist himself in all probability was present and it was natural to him to name it. But where was it? There is no doubt that the reading <span class="greekheb">Βηθανίᾳ</span> is to be preferred. The addition <span class="greekheb">πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου</span> confirms this reading; as the existence of Bethany near Jerusalem rendered the distinguishing designation necessary. Bethany = <span class="greekheb">בֵּת אֲנִיָּה</span> meaning “boat-house,” and Bethabara having the same meaning [<span class="greekheb">עֲבָרָה</span> a ferry boat] is it not possible that the same place may have been called by both names indifferently? Henderson (<span class="ital">Palestine</span>, p. 154) suggests that possibly the explanation of the doubtful reading is that the place referred to is Bethabara which led over into Bethania, that is, Bashan. Similarly Conder (<span class="ital">Handbook</span>, p. 320) says Bethania beyond Jordan is evidently the province of Batanea, and the ford Abârah now discovered leads into Batanea. At this place “John was, baptising,” rather than “John was baptizing”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">Bethabara</span>] The true reading is <span class="bld">Bethany</span>, which was changed to <span class="ital">Bethabara</span> owing to the powerful influence of Origen, who could find no Bethany beyond Jordan known in his day. But in 200 years the very name of an obscure place might easily perish. Origen found ‘Bethany’ in almost all the MSS. The site of Bethabara or Bethany is lost now, but it must have been near Galilee: comp. <span class="ital"><a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a></span> with <span class="ital"><a href="/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a></span>, and see on the ‘four days,’ <a href="/john/11-17.htm" title="Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.">John 11:17</a>. It is possible to reconcile the two readings. Bethabara has been identified with ’Abârah, one of the main Jordan fords about 14 miles south of the sea of Galilee: and ‘Bethania beyond Jordan’ has been identified with Bashan; Bethania or Batanea being the Aramaic form of the Hebrew Bashan, meaning ‘soft level ground.’ Thus Bethabara is the village or ford; Bethania, the district on the east side of the ford.

The fact that John the Baptist,  in the previous verses, recognizes the Messiah, and that in vers. 31-33 he declares that knowledge to have followed the baptism and the sign then given to him, makes it obvious that the baptism and the forty days of the temptation are now in the past. Every day is clearly marked from the day on which the deputation from the Sanhedrin approached him, till we find Jesus at Cana, on his way to Jerusalem. Consequently, the baptism of Christ, which was the occasion of the higher knowledge that John acquired concerning him, as well as the temptation, had been consummated. Of this last it would seem highly probable John had received, in subsequent conversation with the Lord, a full report. The Lord had passed through the fiery ordeal. He had accepted the position of the Servant of the Lord, who, in the way of privation, suffering, fierce antagonism from world, flesh, and devil, would win the crown of victory and prove himself to be the Life and Light of the world. This chronological hint appears to me to explain the sudden and surprising utterance of the next verse. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Bethabara (&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#837;)<p>The correct reading is &#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, Bethany.
