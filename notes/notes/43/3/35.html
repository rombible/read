They were <span class="ital">servants, </span>and were treated as such, being endued with scanty portions of the Spirit, compared to those of which he is possessed; whereas this is the <span class="ital">Son, </span>for which reason God has anointed him with the oil of gladness above his fellows. <span class="ital">And hath given all things into his hand </span>— Hath not only made him the greatest prophet and priest, but the greatest king also, that ever was; even king and judge universal, by whose laws men must govern their lives, and at whose bar they shall all be finally tried. <span class="ital">He</span>, therefore, <span class="ital">that believeth on the Son </span>— With a living faith, a faith of the operation of God, <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>; he that receiveth him in all his offices and characters; <span class="ital">hath everlasting life </span>— Hath a title to it, being a child of God, is an heir of it, has an increasing meetness for it, and an earnest of it by the Holy Spirit in his heart. <span class="ital">And he that believeth not the Son </span>— That does not receive his doctrine in faith and love, and with an obedient mind; or, <span class="ital">who is disobedient to the Son, </span>as the original expression seems more properly to signify; and continues in unbelief and disobedience, <span class="ital">shall not see, </span>or enjoy <span class="ital">life </span>— Either spiritual or eternal; <span class="ital">but the wrath of God abideth on him </span>— Being unpardoned and unrenewed, he remains under the guilt of all his sins, and is continually exposed to that wrath of God which, if his repentance, faith, and new obedience do not prevent, will quickly sink him into final condemnation and ruin. It is justly observed here, by Dr. Doddridge, that “it is of great importance to preserve a difference in the translation between <span class="greekheb">ο πιστευων εις τον υιον</span>, <span class="ital">he that believeth on the Son, </span>and <span class="greekheb">ο απειθων τω υιω</span>, <span class="ital">he that is disobedient to the Son; </span>because the latter phrase explains the former, and shows that the faith, to which the promise of life is annexed, is an effectual principle of sincere and reserved obedience; and it is impossible to make one part of Scripture consistent with another, unless this be taken into our idea of saving faith.” It must be observed, also, that in Scripture the word <span class="ital">abide </span>has frequently a particular signification, denoting the adhesion and permanency of the thing that is said to abide. Of this signification we have an example here, for the Baptist does not speak of that momentary wrath, or displeasure of God, whereby he often chastises his people for their offences, or even cuts them off by a premature death, but of that abiding wrath which torments and does not kill, and being once inflicted never comes to an end. “Thus the Baptist bare testimony to Jesus anew, setting forth his dignity, in the plenitude of his commission, the excellence of his gifts, the nearness of his relation to his heavenly Father, as his only Son, and the greatness of his power, as universal judge:” and thus he concluded those of his testimonies to Christ, which are recorded in the gospel; and was quickly after imprisoned by Herod. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Loveth the Son - Loves him eminently, above all the prophets and all the other messengers of God.<p>Hath given all things into his hand - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35, 36.

There is such a relation as that of Father and Son subsisting between the first and second persons in the Trinity; which is not by constitution and appointment: or arbitrary, arising from, and depending on the will of the first, but is natural and necessary; the second person being begotten by the first, and is of the same nature, and equally a divine person: and which relation is the foundation of the distinction of their persons; and which existed from all eternity, and co-existed with their being and essence; and is what no other stand in, angels or men, in such sense as the second person does; and is not to be conceived of, expressed and explained by us: and from this relation arises love; hence, the Son of the Father is his dear Son, the Son of his love; as he must needs be, since he is of the same nature, has the same perfections he has, and is the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person: and hence he continues to love him in every form and appearance of his; in every office he sustains; in every state and condition into which he comes: he delighted in him as his elect, as chosen and appointed by him to be the Saviour of his people; he took pleasure in him as the surety of them, and when he saw him engaging as such, and declaring it was his heart to do his will, and work out their salvation; he loved him when he appeared in human nature, the form of a servant; and in his state of humiliation, more than once he declared, by a voice from heaven, that he was his beloved Son, and particularly at his baptism: and indeed, as in that, so in every thing else, he always did the things that pleased him; he loved him when he laid down his life for the sheep: when he was bruised, and his soul made an offering for sin; he loved him when on the cross, and even when he hid his face from him; when lay in the grave he left him not, nor would he suffer him to see corruption; he raised him front the dead, and gave him glory; exalted him, and received him into heaven with a welcome, and placed him at his right hand; and now looks with pleasure upon him, upon his person, his sacrifice, blood, and righteousness: and this love is a love of complacency and delight, and is from everlasting to everlasting; the evidence of which lows, <p>and hath given all things into his hand; or "by his hand"; as the doctrines of the Gospel, the gifts of the Spirit, grace, and glory: or rather, "into his hand"; with which he, being the Son of God, a divine person, is fit to be entrusted, which otherwise he would not be:  "all", includes "all persons"; all the angels, the good angels which are chosen in him, and he is the head of; and by whom they are confirmed in the state they are: and who are at his command and beck, and minister to him and his. The evil angels, though they have broke away from God, and rebelled against him, yet are, in some sense, in the hands of Christ, and under his power: as appears by his dispossessing them from the bodies of men on earth, his spoiling them on the cross, and triumphing over them in his ascension to heaven, and by his binding Satan a thousand years. All men are given to him; the elect in a special sense, as his bride and spouse, as his children, and as his sheep; hence, he died for them, and effectually calls them, and brings them to himself; and they shall never perish, or be plucked out of his hands, but shall have eternal life. And wicked men are, in a sense, given to him; their wrath he restrains, and makes it to praise him; he rules then with a rod of iron, and breaks them in pieces as a potter's vessel. And "all things" also are given into his hands; all temporal things, the things of nature and providence; the light of nature, and all the gifts and attainments of it; all the good things of the world, and which are wisdom's left hand blessings; and Christ disposes of them to his people in mercy, and as covenant ones: all spiritual things are in his hands; all the gifts of the Spirit, and the fulness of all grace, sanctifying, justifying, pardoning, adopting, and persevering grace; all the promises and blessings of the covenant; the government of the church, and the judgment of the world; all power, both in heaven and in earth; the salvation of the elect, and their eternal inheritance, happiness, and glory. For all which, creature, angels or men, are fit, only the Son of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The Father loveth the Son, and hath <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> given all things into his hand.</span><p>(b) Committed them to his power and will.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/3-35.htm" title="The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.">John 3:35</a>.

These absolute expressions, “the Father,” “the Son,” are more naturally referred to the evangelist than to the Baptist. This absolute use of “the Son” as a designation of Christ certainly suggests, if it does not prove, the proper Divinity of Christ. It is the favourite designation in this Gospel. The love of the Father for the Son is the reason for His giving to Him the Spirit: nay, it accounts for His committing all things to His hand; <span class="greekheb">πάντα δέδωκεν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ</span>, that is, to possess and to rule. “Facit hic amor, quo Filium amplexus nos quoque in eo amplectitur, ut per illius manum nobis bona sua omnia communicet”—Calvin. But Calvin does not make the mistake of supposing that the words signify “by means of His hand”; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Beza. God has made Christ His plenipotentiary for this world and has done so because of His love. It was a boon then to Christ to come into this world and win it to Himself.

The Berleb. Bible (quoted by Hengstenberg) adds, to the great words, <span class="cmt_word">the Father loveth the Son,</span> "as I sufficiently learned from the voice at the Jordan" - <span class="cmt_word">and hath given all things into his hand.</span> The "all things" may he taken by us in their widest sense (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>) - "all <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in heaven and earth" (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>;  <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>); and the power of determining the final condition of all souls, suggested in ver. 36. But we may conceive a less extended horizon limiting the vision of the Baptist: all things belonging to the kingdom of God, to the progress and consummation of it in the world. John need not be supposed to have swept onward into the eternal future, but mainly to have been thinking of the mutual relations of the forerunner and the Christ. The Son will determine the place of his herald and of his disciple. There is no limit expressed. He who had these matters entrusted to him might easily be supposed to have "all things in his hand." He rested the less upon the greater. </body></html>
