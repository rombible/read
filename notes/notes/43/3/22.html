John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness.

After Christ's coming to Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover, with his disciples, and driving the buyers and sellers from the temple, and doing the miracles he did there, upon which many believed on him; and after the long discourse he had with Nicodemus, concerning regeneration, and other things: <p>came Jesus and his disciples, into the land of Judea; or "into Judea the country", having been in Jerusalem, the city part or chief city in Judea; so that the country is distinguished from, and opposed to the city. And thus, a countryman, and a Jerusalemite, or citizen of Jerusalem, are distinguished (l); <p>"if,  "a countryman", (one that lives in the country any where in the land of Israel out of Jerusalem (m),) receives a field,  "from a man of Jerusalem", the second tithes belong to the Jerusalemite; but the wise men say, the countryman may bring them up, and eat them at Jerusalem.'' <p>Or, it may be, because that Jerusalem was part of it in the tribe of Benjamin, and the other in the tribe of Judah; therefore, when Christ, and his disciples, left Jerusalem, they might more properly be said to come into the land of Judea. Indeed, it is commonly said by the Jews (n), that Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes, and that it did not belong to any tribe; and if so, then with greater propriety still might Christ be said to come into the land of Judea, when he departed from Jerusalem; unless it should be thought, that he went into Galilee, and after that came into the land of Judea; so Nonnus: <p>and there he tarried with them: with his disciples, as Nonnus; and with the inhabitants of those parts: he made a longer stay here than at Jerusalem, having more work to do here, and being more delighted with the plainness and simplicity of the country people; or "he conversed" with them, as the Syriac version renders it; he exercised, and employed himself among them, as the Greek word used signifies: he went about from village to village, doing good, healing diseases, and preaching the Gospel which was made useful to many: <p>and baptized; not he himself, but his disciples, by his orders, and in his name; see <a href="/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>; whereby he gave fresh countenance and sanction to the ordinance of water baptism, administering it to others, as well as submitting to it himself. <p>(l) Misn.

Baur, indeed, thinks that the writer had a definite purpose in view in this mode of expression; that he wished to bring Jesus and the Baptist as closely as possible together in the same work. But if so, the remark of <a href="/john/4-2.htm" title="(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)">John 4:2</a> would be strangely illogical; see also Schweizer, p. 194. The baptism of Jesus, besides, was certainly a continuation of that of John, and did not yet possess the new characteristic of <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a> (for see <a href="/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>); but that it already included that higher element, which John’s baptism did not possess (comp. <a href="/context/acts/19-2.htm" title="He said to them, Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?

This is all the more uncertain, because Aenon, according to the mention of it here (comp. <a href="/john/4-3.htm" title="He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.">John 4:3</a>), must have been in Judaea, and not in Samaria, and <span class="ital">could not</span> therefore have been the Ainun discovered by Robinson (<span class="ital">Later Explorations</span>, p. 400). Ewald thinks of the two places <span class="greekheb">שׁלחים ועין</span> in <a href="/joshua/15-32.htm" title="And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:">Joshua 15:32</a>. So also Wieseler, p. 247. In no case could the towns have been situated on the Jordan, for in that case the statement <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ὝΔΑΤΑ ΠΟΛΛᾺ</span></span></span> would have been quite out of place. Comp. Hengstenberg, who likewise refers to <a href="/joshua/15-32.htm" title="And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:">Joshua 15:32</a>, while Pressel (in Herzog’s <span class="ital">Encykl</span>. XIII. 326) prefers the statement of Eusebius and Jerome. For the rest, the narrative of the temptation, which Hengstenberg places in the period after <a href="/john/3-22.htm" title="After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.">John 3:22</a>, has nothing to do with the locality in this verse; it does not belong to this at all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The question why John, after the public appearance of Jesus, still <span class="ital">continued to baptize</span>, without baptizing <span class="ital">in His name</span>, is answered simply by the fact (against Bretschneider, Weisse, Baur) that Jesus <span class="ital">had not yet come forth as</span> John expected that the Messiah would, and that consequently the Baptist could not have supposed that his work in preparing the way for the Messiah’s kingdom by his baptism of repentance was already accomplished, but had to await for that the divine decision. This perseverance of John, therefore, in his vocation to baptize, was by no means in conflict with his divinely received certainty of the Messiahship of Jesus (as Weizsäcker, p. 320, thinks), and the ministry of both of them side by side must not be looked upon as improbable, as “in itself a splitting in sunder of the Messianic movement” (Keim).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[168] To interpose a longer interval, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> a return to and sojourn in Galilee, is quite gratuitous.

This falls into three parts: (1) a brief account of the movements and success of Jesus and the Baptist which provoked a comparison between them, 22–26; (2) the Baptist’s acceptance of the contrast and final testimony to Jesus, 27–30; (3) the expansion by the evangelist of the Baptist’s words, 31–36.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22–36</span>.

The only conclusion remains, that they art <span class="ital">facts lodged in the memory of a living witness of the events described</span>.” S. p. 86. S.

We have abundant evidence that John baptized before Christ’s public ministry commenced, and that the disciples baptized after His ministry closed. That the one baptism should be the offspring of the other is probable enough antecedently; “yet this is the one passage in which it is positively stated that our Lord authorised baptism during His lifetime.” S. p. 85.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/3-22.htm" title="After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.">John 3:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν γῆν</span>, <span class="ital">into the land of Judæa</span>) from the metropolis of the Jews.

Surrounded or accompanied by some of his disciples (John being one of them), Jesus left the metropolis and betook himself to the countryside. His Messianic claims were not accepted by the authorities. He did not entrust himself to the half-believers. He altered or deviated from the course hitherto adopted, and addressed himself to the less-prejudiced inhabitants of the country places in the province of Judaea. His hour was not yet come. Jerusalem and Judah were thus compared or contrasted in <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-14.htm">Ezra 7:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-18.htm">2 Chronicles 20:18</a>. The precise locality is not stated, though it is probable it was not far from the new scene chosen by John for the continuance of his ministry. The identification of the site of <span class="accented">Aenon</span>, near <span class="accented">Saleim</span>, does not finally determine the <span class="cmt_word">scene of our</span> Lord's abode or baptismal ministry. We are expressly told, both here and in <a href="/john/4-3.htm">John 4:3</a>, that it was in Judaea, not Samaria, that <span class="cmt_word">Jesus there tarried with them, and was baptizing.</span> The words imply a lengthened abode, and a method of ministry which, from that time, he laid aside. The statement that he administered the rite personally is in <a href="/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a> explicitly corrected. The baptism by the disciples was done, however, with the sanction and under the direction of Jesus. As the trial ministry of the twelve apostles (mentioned in <a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10</a>.), occurring during our Lord's earthly life, corresponded with the first preaching of John rather than with that which followed the glorification of Jesus and the Pentecostal effusion, so this ordinance closely resembled the water baptism of John; it was a preparatory symbol, an educational rite, one that allied this early ministry to that of his great forerunner. The water baptism of Jesus corresponded in significance with the water baptism of John. They were one and the same ordinance, predictive, symbolic, anticipatory of the baptism of the Spirit. "Jesus adopted John's baptism ere its waters forever ceased to flow, and thus he blessed and consecrated them. He took up the work of his forerunner and completed it" (Edersheim, 1:393). Weiss (with consent of Renan) admits that these reminiscences reveal their own historicity, and none more so than the return of Jesus for a time to the scenes of the activity of the Baptist. Apparently such an act conflicts with the exalted ideas the author of the Fourth Gospel entertains with reference to his Master. Thoma thinks he sees in Pauhne writings indication of Christ's baptismal ministry, and suggests that the "Johannist" therefore finds a place for such "a washing in water by the Word" in the active word of Jesus! When our Lord, after his resurrection, referred to the baptism with the Spirit, he contrasted it with the baptism of John, and made no reference to his own temporary adoption of the same rite. All water baptism is thus placed in its true relation to the baptism of the Spirit - not as the necessary preliminary of the latter, nor its indispensable seal or guarantee, but as the impressive symbol of the need of heavenly cleansing, and of the direct impact upon the soul of the power of the eternal Spirit. The length of our Lord's residence in Judaea cannot be positively determined; but one hint may be gathered item <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>. The "four months before the harvest" indicate the arrival of the month of December, and therefore the lapse of some eight months between the cleansing of the temple and the return to Galilee. This last event, in Matthew's Gospel (<a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-17</a> with parallels), is associated with the imprisonment of John. The Fourth Gospel, by obvious reference to  the current synoptic chronology of the commencement of the Galilaean ministry (one which made this imprisonment a note of time), shows that the period described in this Gospel, and the baptismal energy of Jesus in Judaea, and the profoundly interesting events mentioned in ch. 3. and 4, were not incompatible with admitted facts. It also suggests that the character of our Lord's ministry in the neighbourhood of the metropolis was closely allied with that which the synoptists described as obtaining in his early Galilaean efforts. We are impressed by the solemn silence which has fallen over these eight months. It may be accounted for on the general principle of the evangelist, which was to fasten upon and preserve the memory of a few solemn moments which especially impressed his own mind, and which had been overlooked or unknown by Matthew and the other evangelists. Moreover, it is more than probable that the author of this Gospel was not with the Master during the whole of this period. There are, however, hints that the rumours of the spiritual might and gathering power of Jesus had produced a great effect upon John the Baptist, and qualified the tone of his last testimony. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The land of Judaea (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Literally, the Judaean land.
