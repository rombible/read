Do they mean “I cannot assume this higher position which you wish to give me, because it is not given me by heaven;” or, “His work, with its influence over men, ought to convince you that His mission is divine “? Expositors have given, now this, now that answer. The immediate connection with <a href="/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a> points to the latter view as the correct one (but see <span class= "ital">Alford’s</span> Note on the other side). The power that had shown itself in word and work, teaching as none ever taught before, binding men—aye, some of their own brotherhood—to Himself, convincing men whose minds were open to the truth that He was the very Christ—all this could only have been received from heaven. Did they feel the movement around them? Let them recognise it as divine, and seek to be borne with it. (See Note on <a href="/john/6-36.htm" title="But I said to you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.">John 6:36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/3-27.htm" title="John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven....">John 3:27-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">John answered </span>— With a humility and integrity agreeable to the rest of his character, <span class="ital">A man can receive nothing </span>— Neither he, nor I, nor any man; <span class="ital">unless it be given him from heaven — </span>Whence every good gift cometh, <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; a general truth, very applicable in this case. Different employments are according to the direction of Divine Providence; different endowments according to the distribution of divine grace. We have as necessary and constant a dependance upon the grace of God in all the actions of the spiritual life, as we have upon the providence of God in all those of the natural life. Dr. Macknight paraphrases the passage thus: “A man of God, or prophet, can assume no greater dignity and authority, than God has thought fit to confer on him. <span class="ital">Ye yourselves bear me witness</span> — For you cannot but remember, <span class="ital">that I said </span>— Very expressly; <span class="ital">I am not the Christ </span>— I never pretended to be the Messiah, as you very well know; but when you asked me, I told you I was only his harbinger sent before, to give you notice of his coming, and to prepare you for receiving him. <span class="ital">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom, </span>&c. — So far am I from envying his growing fame, or the number of his disciples, that I greatly rejoice in both; just as the bridegroom’s friend, who is appointed to stand and hear him converse with his bride, rejoices in the love she expresses to him; of which love the friend forms an idea likewise, by what he hears the bridegroom say to her in return. My highest joy, therefore, is, that men cheerfully submit to the Messiah, and pay him all due honour.” Thus John was so far from regretting the advancement of Christ and his interest: as his disciples did, that he rejoiced in it, expressing his joy by an elegant, well-known, and expressive similitude. As if he had said, “Do all men come to him? It is well: whither else should they go? Has he got the throne in men’s affections? Who else should have it? It is his right. To whom should the bride be brought but to the bridegroom? The Word was made flesh, that the disparity of nature might not be a bar to the union; provision is made for the purifying of the church, that the defilement of sin might be no bar. Christ espouses the church to himself: he has the bride, for he has her love and her promise.” All that John had done in preaching and baptizing, he had done as the friend of the bridegroom, to introduce him to the bride, recommend him to her affections, prepare her for him, and in other respects do him honour and service; and now that he was come, had gained her love, and betrothed her to himself; John had what he wished for, and rejoiced. Thus faithful ministers, as friends of the bridegroom, recommend him to the affections and choice of mankind; and the espousing of souls to Christ in faith and love, is the fulfilling of their joy.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>John answered ... - John did not enter into their feelings or sympathize with their love of party.

All my success was from God. All the success of Jesus is from God. As success comes from the same source, we ought not to be envious. It is designed to answer the same end, and, by whomsoever accomplished, the hand of God is in it, and we should rejoice. If Jesus and his disciples are successful, if all men flee to him, it is proof that God favors him, and you should rejoice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-30.

The Bride is not mine, why should the people stay with me?? Mine it is to point the burdened to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world, to tell them there is Balm in Gilead, and a Physician there. And shall I grudge to see them, in obedience to the call, flying as a cloud, and as doves to their windows? Whose is the Bride but the Bridegroom's? Enough for me to be the Bridegroom's friend, sent by Him to negotiate the match, privileged to bring together the Saviour and those He is come to seek and to save, and rejoicing with joy unspeakable if I may but 'stand and hear the Bridegroom's voice,' witnessing the blessed espousals.

The Syriac and Arabic versions add, "to them"; the answer being made to the disciples of John, who came to him with their complaint: <p>a man can receive nothing; the Syriac and Persic versions add, "of his own will": some understand this of Christ, as man, who did not take upon him the character of the Messiah, nor the office of a Mediator, nor the honour of it of himself; and who received the gifts and graces of the Spirit of God, without measure, and had his success in his work from above: and indeed, it is true of both Christ, and John; for as Christ, so John received his office, and honour, as the harbinger and forerunner of Christ, and all his gifts qualifying for it, and his success in it, not of himself, but of God: and since therefore the superior office, and honour, and usefulness of the one above the other, were according to the sovereign will of God, there was no room for complaint, murmuring, and envy; but there ought to be contentment and pleasure in the wise disposition of things by God. Yea, this is true of every man, who has nothing of his own; and whatever he has in nature, providence and grace, is a gift to him; and all he enjoys is in a way of receiving: nor can he receive it, <p>except it be given him from heaven; from God who dwells there;  See Gill on <a href="/matthew/21-25.htm">Matthew 21:25</a>; who is the author and donor of every gift, temporal, spiritual, and eternal; particularly he cannot perceive, and discern spiritual things, nor receive Gospel truths; as it appeared to John his disciples could not, unless spiritual light is given from above; and such a favour is bestowed, as to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven: and therefore, for every office, whether of a superior, or inferior kind, and for every degree of honour, and for whatsoever blessing and gift, whether for soul or body, for time, or for eternity, men ought to be thankful, and not glory in them, as though they had not received them; nor is there any reason to murmur against God, or envy one another, as these disciples did. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">John answered and said, A man <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</span><p>(u) Why are you trying to better my state?

So Calvin, Beza [“quid conamini meae conditioni aliquid adjicere?”], Bengel [“quomodo audeam ego, inquit, homines ad me adstringere?”], and Lücke. But, as Weiss points out, it is a justification of Jesus which the question of the disciples demands, and this is given in John’s statement that His popularity is God’s gift.

The meaning of John’s declaration is given in two ways: (1) ‘Jesus could not have this great success, unless it were granted Him from Heaven. This ought to satisfy you that He is sent by God;’ (2) ‘I cannot accept the position of supremacy, which you would thrust upon me; because I have not received it from Heaven.’ The former is better, as being a more direct answer to ‘all men come to Him.’ But it is quite possible that both meanings are intended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be given</span>] More literally, <span class="bld">have been</span> <span class="ital">given</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/3-27.htm" title="John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.">John 3:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ δύναται</span>, <span class="ital">cannot</span>) How can I dare, saith he, to bind men to me?—<span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span>, <span class="ital">a man</span>) <span class="ital">I</span>, saith John, <span class="ital">who am but a man</span>.—<span class="greekheb">λαμβάνειν</span>) <span class="ital">to take</span> to himself.—<span class="greekheb">οὐδέν</span>, <span class="ital">nothing</span>) much less the name of Messiah.[58]—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">from heaven</span>) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> from God.

For instance, I. John had no <span class="ital">forerunner</span>, but himself acted the part of a forerunuer, such as was becoming [to go before] Christ the Lord; wherefore, as well in birth, as in entrance on his ministry, and in his departure, he preceded Christ. II. John wrought <span class="ital">no miracle</span>: Christ very many. III. John, as well as his baptism, was <span class="ital">restricted</span> to the Jordan; whereas Christ shone as a light [illuminated all things] in Judea, Galilee, and the regions situated beyond Jordan. IV. John, after being for a considerable time detained <span class="ital">in bonds</span>, was at length slain in prison: Christ, without imprisonment up to His very death, nay, even being bound, and especially on the very day of His execution, in the sight of the world, did and spake all that became Him. V. John <span class="ital">was beheaded</span>: Christ’s body, though piteously afflicted, was yet not mutilated, bat remained preserved in that state which would be suitable to His resurrection about to take place on the third day.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 166, etc.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-32.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The earthly and heavenly commission.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing</span> - neither office, function, faculty, nor life work, in the kingdom of God - <span class="cmt_word">except it has been given him from</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven.</span> The raying is broad, general, comprehensive, sustaining. It is not the glorification of success, but an explanation of the ground of high service. All good service, all high faculty, all holy mission, all sacred duty, are assigned to us by Heaven.

Commentators have ranged themselves into three groups as to the primary application of the words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Those who have limited the mental reference to John himself. "My function is, as I am about to explain, a subordinate one," "I have received that and nothing else from heaven." "I cannot make myself into the Bridegroom of the Church, or the Light of the world, or the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost." "I have received that only which is given and assigned to me by God." (So Bengel, Calvin, Hengstenberg, and at one time Godet.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Those who regard it as being a distinct reference to Christ, and as a vindication of Jesus from the complaint of John's own disciples. The high activity and present position of Jesus is declared by John to have been conferred on Christ "from heaven." He would not, could not, have taken it upon himself apart from the Divine order. (So Godet, Meyer, Watkins, Thorns.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Those who refer it to both "John and Jesus;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> accept it as the general principle, applicable with equal force to them both. Intense man that he was. John felt justified in referring the entire function and mission of both the Christ and his forerunner to the will, predestination, and bestowment of Heaven. (So Wettstein, Lunge, Luthardt, Lucke, Westcott, Geikie, Moulton.) This is surely the most obvious and rational interpretation. Perhaps "heaven" is not exactly identical with "God," but may point to the whole of the providential circumstances, to the Divine resources, to the inheritance of effects from more remote antecedents in the Divine will; but it is difficult to press this distinction in all cases. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Receive<p>Answering to given.<p>Be given (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., more correctly, have been given.<p>From heaven<p>Literally, out of heaven (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;). </body></html>
