Then the contrast carries him away from this thought of self, in all its weakness, to dwell on the fulness of the teaching of the perfect Teacher, and he emphatically repeats, with the change of words suggested by “of the earth,” what he has before said of it, “He that cometh from heaven is above all.”<p>This repetition is the answer to the jealousy of his disciples, who wished to place him in a position of rivalry with Jesus. It is the answer to all self-assertion on the part of human teachers.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that cometh from above - The Messiah, represented as coming down from heaven.

It is comparatively obscure and imperfect, not full and clear, like the teaching of him who is from above.

He that, &c.&#8212;Here is the reason why He must increase while all human teachers must decrease. The Master "cometh from above"&#8212;descending from His proper element, the region of those "heavenly things" which He came to reveal, and so, although mingling with men and things on the earth, is not "of the earth," either in Person or Word. The servants, on the contrary, springing of earth, are of the earth, and their testimony, even though divine in authority, partakes necessarily of their own earthiness. (So strongly did the Baptist feel this contrast that the last clause just repeats the first). It is impossible for a sharper line of distinction to be drawn between Christ and all human teachers, even when divinely commissioned and speaking by the power of the Holy Ghost. And who does not perceive it? The words of prophets and apostles are undeniable and most precious truth; but in the words of Christ we hear a voice as from the excellent Glory, the Eternal Word making Himself heard in our own flesh.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He that cometh from heaven, (for it appeareth by the latter part of the verse, that is the sense of <span class="ital">from above</span>), as Christ did, not only in respect of his Divine nature, but being (as to his whole person) clothed with majesty and authority from above, infinitely excelleth any one who is a mere creature: he that is of an earthly original, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">speaketh of the earth.</span> Such as is a man’s original, such is his nature, such is his discourse.

We perceive how the Baptist, as if with the mind of Jesus Himself, unveils before his disciples, in the narrower circle of whom he speaks, with the growing inspiration of the last prophet, the full majesty of Jesus; and therewith, as if with his swanlike song, <span class="ital">completes</span> his testimony before he vanishes from the history.[174] Even the subsequent momentary perplexity (Matthew 11) is psychologically not irreconcilable with this (see on <a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>), simply because John was <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς Γῆς</span></span></span>. But the Baptist, notwithstanding his witness concerning Jesus, has not gone over to Him, because the calling of <span class="ital">forerunner</span> had been once divinely committed to him, and he felt that he must continue to fulfil it so long as the Messianic kingdom was not yet established. These remarks tell, at the same time, against the use which is made of this passage to prove that the entire scene is unhistorical (Strauss, Weisse, Reuss, Scholten, following Bretschneider).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄνωθεν ἐρχόμ</span>.] <span class="ital">He who cometh from, above, i.e</span>.

This was John’s case: he spoke of ‘earthly things’ (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12</a></span>), Divine Truth <span class="ital">as manifested in the world</span>, and as revealed to him. He could not, like Christ, speak from immediate knowledge of ‘heavenly things.’ Note that ‘speaking of the <span class="ital">earth</span>’ is a very different thing from ‘speaking of the <span class="ital">world</span>’ (<a href="/1_john/4-5.htm" title="They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears them.">1 John 4:5</a>). The one is to speak of God’s work on earth; the other of what opposes, or at least is other than, God’s work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he that cometh from heaven</span>] A repetition with further development, very characteristic of S. John’s style.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">31–36</span>. A question is raised with regard to this section similar to that raised about <span class="ital"><a href="/context/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life....">John 3:16-21</a></span>. Some regard what follows not as a continuation of the Baptist’s speech, but as the Evangelist’s comment upon it. But, as in the former case, seeing that the Evangelist gives us no intimation that he is taking the place of the speaker, and that there is nothing in what follows to compel us to suppose that there is such a transition, it is best to regard the Baptist as still speaking. It is, however, quite possible that this latter part of the discourse is more strongly coloured with the Evangelist’s own style and phraseology, while the substance still remains the Baptist’s. Indeed a change of style may be noticed. The sentences become less abrupt and more connected; the stream of thought is continuous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The Baptist, with the growing inspiration of the prophet, unveils before his narrowing circle of disciples the full majesty of Jesus; and then, as with a swan-like song, completes his testimony before vanishing from history.” Meyer, <span class="ital">in loco</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no contradiction between this passage and <a href="/context/matthew/11-2.htm" title="Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,...">Matthew 11:2-6</a>, whatever construction we put on the latter (see notes there). John was ‘of the earth,’ and therefore there is nothing improbable in his here impressing on his disciples the peril of not believing on the Messiah, and yet in prison feeling impatience, or despondency, or even doubt about the position and career of Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἄνωθεν</span>, <span class="ital">He who is from above</span>) These words, and on to the end of the chapter, the Evangelist seems to have appended, as in congruity with the feeling of the Baptist: comp. notes, ch. <a href="/john/1-7.htm" title="The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.">John 1:7</a>.

Therefore [He is] also above John.

The antithetic proposition forthwith corresponds, consisting also of three members. It is not said, <span class="ital">He that cometh from the earth</span>: because He was also <span class="ital">on</span> the earth; but it is said, <span class="ital">He who cometh from above, who cometh from heaven</span>, to wit, to the earth: for previously He was in <span class="ital">heaven</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἐστί</span>, <span class="ital">is of the earth</span>) The antithesis to this is, <span class="ital">is above all</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς γῆς λαλεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">speaketh of the earth</span>) for which reason the inhabitants of the earth the more readily hear him. The spiritual excellence of a teacher is not to be measured by the pleasure of the audience.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - A large number of commentators of all schools hold that the remaining verses of this chapter give us the reflections of the evangelist rather than a continuous discourse of the Baptist. Strauss, Weisse, Reuss, and Bretschneider, who make the supposed proof of this Johannine appendix to the Baptist's words an evidence of inhistoricity throughout the Gospel, and the school of Baur, which finds in the entire representation simply an artistic endeavour on the part of a second century <span class="accented">falsarius</span> to show that John's disciples were absorbed into the Catholic Church, are joined here by Bengel, De Wette, Westcott, Moulton, and Edersheim, who see no difficulty in the introduction of these sentiments, which correspond with those of the Epistles of John, as an appendix of the evangelist, and not a reminiscence of the teaching of the Baptist. The reasons in favour of this view are that the ideas and phraseology are said to be far in advance of John the Baptist's theological position, and certainly reflect the later teaching of the Master. We will consider some of these <span class="accented">seriatim</span>, but cannot accept the argument as final. Hengstenberg, Meyer, Godet, Alford, Lange, even Renan, do not yield to the positions thus assumed, nor will they admit any word of the Baptist here uttered to be inconsistent with the known doctrine of the forerunner; whereas they urge that the simple communication to John of the substance of our Lord's discourse to Nicodemus is adequate explanation of the similarities between the two. It may be admitted that some subjective colouring from the apostle's own mind may have been transfused by him into his report of both discourses, which we cannot doubt (whatever may be said about the Galilaean ministry) were conducted in the Aramaic tongue. Weiss makes the pertinent suggestion that we cannot think that John the son of Zebedee beard the final testimony of the Baptist. It may easily have been communicated to the circle around Jesus by Andrew and some other disciple of the two masters. This may account for the appearance throughout the discourse of more Johannine language than usual. If we cannot, or may not, make these simple hypotheses, then we too should be disposed to think that the subjective element had so predominated as almost to hide the historic quality of the whole of this swanlike song of the Old Testament dispensation. But the hypotheses seem to be highly probable and extremely natural, and the coherence of the passage with what has gone before to be obvious and complete. The discourse contrasts the entire prophetic ministry with that of the Son of God (vers. 31, 32), which then sets forth the menus of appropriating the Divine gift of the Son of God (vers. 33-35), and predicts the awful issues of rejecting the supreme claims of the Divine Lord (ver. 36). The teaching is in accord with Old Testament doctrine, illumined, as we learn that John's was, by special visions, and by communications to him of the significance of the Lord's uttered words. It is quite irrelevant, if not absurd, to say that such a testimony of the forerunner makes the  cotinuance or spread of John's teaching and baptism impossible; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words were obviously addressed to a small group only of the many thousands who heard John preach, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it does not follow that all those who heard these memorable words should have deserted their first master, even in deference to his own advice. The words that follow, whether a simple record of John's discourse or one deeply coloured by the subjectivity of the evangelist, are as follows: - <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is coming from above is above all.</span> Now, it is obvious that Jesus had spoken of the Son of man as having come down from heaven (ver. 13), and of his own power to speak of heavenly things (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of causes and measures of Divine operations); and he contrasts these with the "earthly things" of which he too had spoken - "earthly" they were because they dealt with experiences felt and witnessed and realized on earth. Now, John is represented, on the occasion of the baptism of our Lord, as being convinced that Jesus was "the Son of God," and that his existence was prior to his own, and that his rank in the universe was one utterly transcending his own. These statements have been already put into the lips of John by the fourth evangelist, and are scarcely exceeded, if at all, by the utterance before us. We find a bold contrast between the Logos himself and the witness to the manifested Logos. <span class="accented">He who cometh from above</span>, being before John, and being, therefore, in his essential dignity, superior to him, <span class="accented">is above all</span>, and therefore above him. <span class="cmt_word">He that is,</span> in his origin and the entire self-realization of his life, <span class="cmt_word">from the earth</span>, and not incarnate Logos, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the earth</span> in quality, <span class="cmt_word">and speaketh of the earth</span> (observe, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> is here used). The experiences to which he refers are enacted on the earth, and he has no power to go back and heavenwards for the full explanation of them. Higher than heaven are the thoughts and revelations of the Son of God. He can unveil the heart of the eternal Father. Christ can link his own work with the ministry of the mightiest of the Heaven-sent messengers; but John starts from the consciousness, the perils, the self-deceptions and contrition of man. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that cometh out of heaven is above all.</span> This great utterance is repeated, and it involves little more than what John had implied to the Sanhedrin (<a href="/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30-34</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that cometh (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>The present participle.
