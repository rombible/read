He has life; the man who disobeys has not, and while he disobeys shall not see life, for he cannot be a subject of a kingdom to whose laws he refuses allegiance.

There is for him a present possession, which shall also remain.<p><span class= "bld">The wrath of God abideth on him.</span>—Once only in the four Gospels does this term, so full of tremendous meaning, meet us, and that in the Gospel of fullest love, and in a context which speaks of the Father’s love to the Son, and of eternal life, which is the portion of all who believe on the Son. It must be so. This wrath (comp. <a href="/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm" title="And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.">Revelation 19:15</a>) is not the fierceness of passion, nor is it the expression of fixed hatred. It is the necessary aspect of love and holiness toward those who reject love, and wilfully sin. It is not here spoken of as coming upon them, or as passing from them. It abideth, ever has and ever must; for the wrath of love must abide on hatred, the wrath of holiness must abide on sin. But none need hate, and none need live in wilful sin. “He that believeth”—how vast the love and bright the hope of the all-including words—“hath eternal life”! (Comp.

He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hath everlasting life - Has or is in possession of that which is a recovery from spiritual death, and which will result in eternal life in heaven. Piety here is the same that it will be there, except that it will be expanded, matured, purified, made more glorious. It is here life begun the first breathings and pantings of the soul for immortality; yet it is life, though at first feeble and faint, which is eternal in its nature, and which shall be matured in the full and perfect bliss of heaven. The Christian here has a foretaste of the world of glory, and enjoys the same kind of felicity, though not the same degree, that he will there.<p>Shall not see life - Shall neither enjoy true life or happiness here nor in the world to come.

His opposition to sin, and its terrible effects in this world and the next.<p>Abideth on him - This implies that he is "now" under the wrath of God, or under condemnation. It implies, also, that it will continue to remain on him. It will "abide" or "dwell" there as its appropriate habitation. As there is no way of escaping the wrath of God but by the Lord Jesus Christ, so those who will not believe must go to eternity "as they are," and bear alone and unpitied all that God may choose to inflict as the expression of "his" sense of sin. Such is the miserable condition of the sinner! Yet thousands choose to remain in this state, and to encounter alone all that is terrible in the wrath of Almighty God, rather than come to Jesus, who has borne their sins in his own body on the tree, and who is willing to bless them with the peace, and purity, and joy of immortal life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. hath everlasting life&#8212;already has it.

This <span class="greekheb">μένει</span> (it is not termed <span class="greekheb">ἔρχεται</span>) implies that the person who rejects faith is still in a moral condition which is subject to the divine wrath,—a state of subjection to wrath, which, instead of being removed by faith, <span class="ital">abides</span> upon him through his unbelief. The wrath, therefore, is not first awakened by the refusal to believe (Ritschl, <span class="ital">de ira Dei</span>, pp. 18, 19; Godet), but is already there, and through that refusal remains.[180] Whether or not this wrath rests upon the man <span class="ital">from his birth</span> (Augustine; Thomasius, <span class="ital">Chr.

Christ has been represented as Sovereign, commissioned with supreme powers, especially for the purpose of saving men and restoring them to God. Hence “he that believeth on the Son hath eternal life”. He who through the Son finds and accepts the Father has life in this very vision and fellowship of the Supreme; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>.

But will enters into the former as well as the latter. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, the wrath of God denotes “the fixed and necessary hostility of the Divine nature to sin”; what appears in a righteous man as indignation; and also the manifestation of that hostility in acts of retributive justice. This is the only place in the Gospel where it occurs; but in <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a>, we have “the wrath of the Lamb”; also <a href="/john/16-19.htm" title="Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?">John 16:19</a>, “the wine of the fury of His wrath”; also <a href="/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>, <a href="/john/11-18.htm" title="Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:">John 11:18</a>, <a href="/john/19-15.htm" title="But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.

Note the tense; ‘hath’ not ‘shall have.’ Believers are already in possession of eternal life. Christians often think of eternal life as something yet to be won.

These words, which above every other clause in this "swanlike song," are suffused with a glow that it is difficult to believe issued from the heart of the forerunner, unless we may make the supposition already referred to, that some of John's former disciples had carried to his earlier master the grand refrain of the discourse to Nicodemus. The entrusting of the soul in utter moral surrender to the Son of God, <span class="accented">is</span> life - eternal life. All cruel suspicions of God vanish when the veil is lifted which sin and the corruption of the human heart have hung over the holiest of all. John had passed into a new world when he discovered the true nature of the kingdom - the tempted, humbled, sacrificial, triumphant character of the Son of God. To believe on the Son is to have the life. <span class="cmt_word">But he that is disobedient to the Son.</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are, in the English Version, translated "believeth not," and again so in <a href="/romans/11-30.htm">Romans 11:30</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> are used interchangeably. The word means one who is (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> distrustful, who refuses to be persuaded, is contumacious and expresses the opposite to faith in active exercise, who repudiates faith on its fiducial and practical side. Nothing is said of those who have had no opportunity of coming to a knowledge of the Son of God. Shall not see life; shall not even see so as to be able to conceive of, much less enjoy, life (Westcott; see ver. 3). There is a <span class="accented">blinding</span> power in disobedience, which prevents those who are actively hostile to the essential excellences and glories of Christ from even knowing what <span class="accented">life is. Life</span> is obviously here and elsewhere more than physical existence, or than its continuance, or than its resuscitation after death; it is the activity of the new spirit, the supernatural and eternal blessedness wrought by "birth of the Spirit." Nor is the calamity referred to a mere negation. John may be said here to have gone beyond the words of the Master in the previous discourse, and, moreover, it is in fiery earnestness that he speaks. <span class="cmt_word">The wrath of God,</span> which has already been called down upon him by his disobedience, <span class="cmt_word">abideth on him.</span> God's <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> had been spoken of by the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7</a>); and the term, wherever used, is far more than "the consuming fire of infinite love," into which many strive to resolve it. It represents active and terrible displeasure revealed from heaven (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>; <a href="/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>). Much of the wrath of the Lord is said to be temporary in its character (Wisd. 16:5 Wisd. 18:20); but this is abiding, and, so far as is here revealed, permanent. The most terrible expression in the New Testament is the "wrath of the Lamb" (<a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a>). The last word of the Baptist, even in the Fourth Gospel, is a word of thunder, and he disappears from view when he has delivered this terrible condemnation on those who are wilfully, actively resisting that Son whom "the Father loves," and to whose hands he has "entrusted all things." The ministry of John is, after all, that of the Elijah, not that of the Christ. To the last word, even if the phraseology has been moulded in the Greek of the fourth evangelist into a closer resemblance to his own vocabulary, and if by his attempt to epitomize what may have taken hours to say in varied phrase, the apostle has unconsciously adopted some of his own favourite terms, yet the message flashes with the fire of the prophet of the wilderness; and men are threatened with the peril of abiding under the wrath of Almighty God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that believeth not (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>More correctly, as Rev., obeyeth not. Disbelief is regarded in its active manifestation, disobedience. The verb &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9; means to persuade, to cause belief, to induce one to do something by persuading, and so runs into the meaning of to obey, properly as the result of persuasion.

He who believes is within the circle of the life of God, which is essentially eternal. His life "is hid with Christ in God." Life eternal is to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent. Hence, to such an one, eternal life is not merely something future. It is a present possession. He hath it. The unbelieving and disobedient, instead of having eternal life, shall not have life: shall not even see it (compare see the kingdom of God, <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>). He shall have no perception of life simply considered, much less of eternal life, the full and complex development of life.<p>The wrath of God (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Both &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; and &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; are used in the New Testament for wrath or anger, and without any commonly observed distinction. &#x39f;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7; denotes a deeper and more permanent sentiment; a settled habit of mind; while &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; is a more turbulent, but temporary agitation. Both words are used in the phrase wrath of God, which commonly denotes a distinct manifestation of God's judgment (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>; <a href="/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; <a href="/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). &#x39f;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768; (not &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;) also appears in the phrase the wrath to come (<a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href="/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>, etc.).
