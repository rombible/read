What the exact nature of it was we do not know, and have no means of judging. It was one of the questions which in every age has arisen about external rites, and has too often been accompanied by a neglect of inner principles. This arose in some way from the fact of the disciples of Jesus baptising near to the place where John was baptising, and doubtless was closely connected with these baptisms.

He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A question - Rather a controversy a dispute.<p>John's disciples - Those who had been baptized by him, and who attached great efficacy and importance to the teaching of their master. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1-5</a>.<p>And the Jews - Many manuscripts, some of the fathers, and the ancient Syriac version read this in the singular number "with A Jew," one who, it is commonly supposed, had been baptized by the disciples of Jesus.<p>About purifying - What the precise subject of this dispute was we do not know. From what follows, it would seem probable that it was about the comparative value and efficacy of the baptism performed by John and by the disciples of Jesus. The word "purifying" may be applied to baptism, as it was an emblem of repentance and purity, and was thus used by the Jews, by John, and by Jesus. About this subject it seems that a dispute arose, and was carried to such a length that complaint was made to John. From this we may learn:<p>1. that even in the time of Jesus, when the gospel began to be preached, there was witnessed what has been ever since - unhappy disputings on the subject of religion. Even young converts may, By overheated zeal and ignorance, fall into angry discussion.<p>2. that such discussions are commonly about some unimportant matter of religion - something which they may not yet be qualified to understand, and which does not materially affect them if they could.<p>3. that such disputes are often connected with a spirit of proselytism - with boasting of the superior excellence of the sect with which "we" are connected, or in connection with whom we have been converted, and often with a desire to persuade others to join with us.<p>4. that such a spirit is eminently improper on such occasions. Love should characterize the feelings of young converts; a disposition to inquire and not to dispute; a willingness that all should follow the dictates of their own consciences, and not a desire to proselyte them to our way of thinking or to our church. It may be added that there is scarcely anything which so certainly and effectually arrests a revival of religion as such a disposition to dispute, and to make proselytes to particular modes of faith, and of administering the ordinances of the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25, 26. between some of&#8212;rather, "on the part of."<p>and the Jews&#8212;rather (according to the best manuscripts), "and a Jew,"<p>about purifying&#8212;that is, baptizing, the symbolical meaning of washing with water being put (as in Joh 2:6) for the act itself. As John and Jesus were the only teachers who baptized Jews, discussions might easily arise between the Baptist's disciples and such Jews as declined to submit to that rite.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Jews had so many purifyings, some legal, instituted by God, ordained by Moses as God’s minister; some traditional, brought in by the Pharisees, as their washings before meat, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/15-1.htm" title="Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,...">Matthew 15:1-20</a> <a href="/context/mark/7-1.htm" title="Then came together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem....">Mark 7:1-23</a></span>; that seemeth a hard thing to determine what the question was between John’s disciples and the Jews, about what purifying; and the boldest determiners in this case are no better than guessers. Some would have baptism to be meant here by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">purifying.</span> It would much conduce to the resolution of the question if we knew what these Jews were with whom John’s disciples argued. If they were of the Pharisees, it is probable the question was about John’s baptism, considering the frequent washings and purifyings that they had in use amongst them. If they were other Jews, the question might be about the virtue and efficacy of the ceremonial washings, ordained by the law of God, whether they were mere types, and now to cease? Whether in themselves they conduced any thing to the washing and cleansing of a soul? If these Jews were (as some think, but I know not how it can be proved) disciples of Christ, the question might be about John’s and Christ’s baptism. This notion seemeth to be favoured by what went before; where the evangelist had been speaking of baptism, as administered by Christ’s disciples, and by John; as also from what followeth, viz. John’s disciples coming to him and complaining, that Christ by his disciples baptized more than their master. But there seemeth to be this great prejudice against the notion of those learned men that have embraced that notion, viz. That the question is said to have risen between <span class="ital">John’s disciples and the Jews; </span> now we want an instance in Scripture, where the disciples of John are put in opposition to the disciples of Christ, and under notion of the Jews; the term <span class="ital">Jews</span> generally signifying that part of the people who adhered to the Judaical rites and religion; especially where (as here) it is used in opposition either to the disciples of John or of Christ. It is most probable therefore the question was, either about the washings ordained by the law of Moses, or about the traditional washings observed by the Pharisees. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then there arose a question,....

Nothing is known more particularly as to this question (<span class="greekheb">ζήτησις</span>) which arose among John’s disciples (<span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο ἐκ τῶν μαθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰωάνν</span>, comp. Lucian. <span class="ital">Alex</span>. 40; Herod. v. 21). The theme of it was “<span class="ital">concerning purification</span>” (<span class="greekheb">περὶ καθαρισμοῦ</span>), and, according to the context, it did not refer to the usual prescriptions and customs in general (Weizsäcker), but had a closer reference to the baptism of John and of Jesus, and was discussed <span class="ital">with a Jew</span>, who probably placed the baptism of Jesus, as being of higher and greater efficacy with regard to the power of purifying (from the guilt of sin), above that of John. Comp. <a href="/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a>.

According to Luthardt, it was an <span class="ital">unfriendly</span> Jew who declared that the baptism of John might now at length be dispensed with, and who wished thus to beguile the Baptist to become unfaithful to his calling, by which means he hoped the better to work against Jesus.

Through the statements of the Jew, with whom they had been discussing the question of purification, there was awakened in them a certain feeling of envy that Jesus, the former pupil (as they thought), the receiver of a testimony at the hand of their master, should now presume to put himself forward as his superior rival. They saw in this a usurpation, which they could not reconcile with the previous position of Jesus in relation to the Baptist. But he, on the contrary, vindicates Jesus, <a href="/john/3-27.htm" title="John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.">John 3:27</a>, and in <a href="/john/3-28.htm" title="You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.">John 3:28</a> brings into view His far higher position, which excluded all jealousy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὃς ἦν μετὰ σοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <a href="/context/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing....">John 1:28-29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἴδε</span> and <span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span> have the emphasis of something unexpected; namely, that this very individual should (according to their view) interfere with their master in his vocation, and with such results!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ πάντες</span>, an exaggeration of excited feeling.

That Jesus should baptise as well as John they could not understand.

The word (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) "questioning" is used in <a href="/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a> for the dispute at Antioch, and Paul uses the same phrase for dangerous, useless, and angry debate (<a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23</a>; <a href="/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>). It was, perhaps, not the first, and certainly it was not the last, of the controversies which raged over the symbolic purification of the Church. John's disciples appear to have taken up arms against some particular <span class="accented">Jew</span>, who was prepared either to question the right of Jesus to baptize, or the essential value of this ordinance. This "Jew" was apparently maintaining a greater potency for the baptism of Jesus than John could claim for his, and was basing his view upon the testimony which John had already borne to Jesus. <span class="accented">Purifying</span> was the great theme of Essenic and Pharisaic profession. It was without doubt one of the great symbolic purposes of the Levitical legislation. The purification of the flesh was, however, in Christ's teaching, a very small part of the claim for purity. Nothing less than a spiritual and radical moral change availed, and our Lord insisted on this to the disparagement of the mere ceremonial. This was the first recorded discussion on the nature and value of baptismal purifying. Would that it had been the last! The question arose among those who had been baptized by John, whether another had any right to administer such an ordinance? Could another receive the confession of sins? Was the baptism of John to terminate now that he had come of whom John himself had said, "This is he that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Then (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Not a particle of time but of consequence; therefore, because of both Jesus and John baptizing.<p>Question (&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., more correctly, questioning.
