It must be so. So too in the interpretation. His own work was well-nigh done, but he is filled with the joy of having done his work, not with disappointment that it pales before the brightness of the work which is to follow. This is the text of the Forerunner’s life. Well will it be for those followers of Christ whose lives shall be sermons on it!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/3-30.htm" title="He must increase, but I must decrease....">John 3:30-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">He must increase </span>— And appear continually more and more glorious, like the growing moon; <span class="ital">but I must decrease </span>— Must gradually wane and decline, till I disappear: for the end of my ministry is now, in a great measure, answered, and therefore I quickly expect to be dismissed from it. <span class="ital">He that cometh from above is above all </span>— As if he had said, It is fit he should increase, while I decrease; for he is a person of infinitely greater dignity than I am, possesses far more knowledge of the divine will, and the discoveries which he makes thereof as far transcend mine as heaven exceeds earth. Thus John speaks of Christ’s increase and his own decrease, not only as what was necessary and unavoidable, and that which could not be prevented, and therefore must be borne; but as highly just and agreeable to him: and he is entirely satisfied with it, nay, and rejoices in it. Thus they who are now like John, burning and shining lights, must, (if not suddenly eclipsed,) like him, gradually decrease, while others are increasing about them; as they in their turns grew up amid the decays of the former generation. Let us know how to set as well as how to rise; and let it comfort our declining days, to trace, in those who are likely to succeed us in our work, the openings of yet greater usefulness. But let us especially rejoice to observe the glory of Christ increasing, and eclipsing the lustre of all other glory, as the increasing light of the morning causes the glory of the morning star to decline, and at last entirely to disappear. And, if our diminution and abasement may but in the least contribute to the advancement of his name and honour, let us cheerfully submit to it, and be content to be any thing, yea, to be nothing, so that Christ may be all.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He must increase - his authority and influence among the people must grow. his doctrine shall continue to spread until it extends through all the earth.<p>I must decrease - "The purpose of my ministry is to point men to him. When that is done my work is done. I came not to form a party of my own, nor to set up a religion of my own; and my teaching must cease when he is fully established, as the light of the morning star fades away and is lost in the beams of the rising sun. This evinced John's humility and willingness to be esteemed as nothing if he could honor Christ. It shows us, also, that it is sufficient honor for man if he may be permitted to point sinners to the Lord Jesus Christ. No work is so honorable and joyful as the ministry of the gospel; none are so highly honored as those who are permitted to stand near the Son of God, lead perishing men to his cross.

The Bride is not mine, why should the people stay with me?? Mine it is to point the burdened to the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world, to tell them there is Balm in Gilead, and a Physician there. And shall I grudge to see them, in obedience to the call, flying as a cloud, and as doves to their windows? Whose is the Bride but the Bridegroom's? Enough for me to be the Bridegroom's friend, sent by Him to negotiate the match, privileged to bring together the Saviour and those He is come to seek and to save, and rejoicing with joy unspeakable if I may but 'stand and hear the Bridegroom's voice,' witnessing the blessed espousals.

Not in stature of body, or in wisdom and understanding of mind, as man, he being come to maturity in these things already; but in fame, credit, and reputation among men; as he afterwards did in the land of Judea, by reason of his miracles and doctrines; and after that among the Gentiles, through the publication of his Gospel; and will more and more in the latter day, when he, and he alone, shall be exalted: and he must increase in the ministry of his word, which was published by him, and his disciples, throughout all the cities of Israel; and which, after his resurrection and ascension, grew and increased mightily, notwithstanding the opposition made unto it both by their civil and ecclesiastical rulers; and which, by the means of his apostles, was spread throughout the Gentile world, and will hereafter cover the earth, as the waters do the sea: and also in his kingdom and interest, which at first were very small, like a grain of mustard seed, or like a little stone cut out of the mountain without hands; but in process of time grew exceedingly, and will, ere long, till the face of the whole earth; for the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth; and of the increase of it there shall be no end. And so likewise in the number of his followers, which at first were but few in Judea, but afterwards greatly increased, and especially among the Gentiles; and will be very numerous in the latter day glory, when the nation of the Jews will be born at once, and the fulness and forces of the Gentiles are brought in: <p>but I must decrease; as he did in his esteem among the people; see <a href="/john/5-3.htm">John 5:3</a>; and in his work and office, which were now come to an end, Christ, whose forerunner he was, being come; and quickly after this he was put into prison, and there put to death. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He must increase, but I must decrease.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/3-30.htm" title="He must increase, but I must decrease.">John 3:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνον δεῖ αὐξάνειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐμὲ δὲ ἐλαττοῦσθαι</span>. Paley translates, “it is for Him to go on growing and for me to be ever getting less,” and adds, “the language seems to be solar”. In the Church Calendar, no doubt, John the Baptist’s day is Midsummer Day, while our Lord’s “natalitia” is midwinter, but scarcely founded on solar considerations of the day’s increase after Christmas and decrease after 24th June. Rather John is the morning star “fidelis Lucifer” whose light is eclipsed in that of the rising sun (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Bernard’s “Lucet ergo Johannes, tanto verius quanto minus appetit lucere,” and Euthyrnius, <span class="greekheb">ἐλαττοῦσθαι ὡς ἡλίου ἀνατείλαντος ἑωσφόρον</span>). If the style of the following verses is any clue to their authorship we must ascribe them to the evangelist. Besides, some of the expressions are out of place in the Baptist’s lips: <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν μαρτυρίαν αὐτοῦ οὐδεὶς λαμβάνει</span> could scarcely have been said at the very time when crowds were flocking to Him. The precise point in the Baptist’s language to which the evangelist attaches this commentary or expansion [“theils erklärende, theils erweiternde Reflexion,” Lücke] is his affirmation of the Messiah’s superiority to himself. To this John adds (<a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>): He is superior not only to the Baptist but to all, <span class="greekheb">ἐπάνω πάντων ἐστίν</span>, the reason being that He comes from above, <span class="greekheb">ἄνωθεν</span>; which is the equivalent of <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span> in the latter part of the verse. These expressions are contrasted with <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς γῆς</span>, the ordinary earthly origin of men, and they refer Christ’s origin to a higher and unique source: unique because the result of this origin is that He is supreme over <span class="ital">all</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπάνω πάντων</span>. His origin is superior to that of all, therefore His supremacy is universal (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>). The results of origin, whether earthly or heavenly, are traced out in a twofold direction: in the kind of life lived and in the words spoken. On the one hand <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐκ τῆς γῆς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span>. The first <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> expresses origin: the second moral connection, as in <a href="/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>, <a href="/john/15-19.htm" title="If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.">John 15:19</a> : he whose origin is earthly is an earthly person, his life rises no higher than its source, his interests and associations are of earth. Another result is given in the words <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς γῆς λαλεῖ</span>, from the earth his ideas and his utterance of them spring. A man’s talk and teaching cannot rise above their source. So far as experimental knowledge goes he is circumscribed by his origin. In contrast to persons of earthly origin stands <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐρχόμενος</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἐρχ</span>. is added that not only his origin but his transition to his present condition may be indicated. His origin in like manner determines both his moral relationships and his teaching. The one is given in <span class="greekheb">ἐπάνω πάντων ἐστί</span>. He lives in a higher region than all others and is not limited by earthly conditions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="bld"><span class="ital">must</span></span>] It is so ordained in the counsels of God.

Some have felt the improbability of the great prophet, the ascetic reformer, acquiescing so patiently in the diminution of his influence or the virtual cessation of the primary importance of his career. Yet this is in complete harmony with John's repeated and continuous recognition of the preparatory and transitory nature of his own work. He cannot lay down his commission, but he knows that, like prophetism, priesthood, Nazarite asceticism, and the like, it will be merged in the grander life of which he was the herald. The ministers of the New Testament all take up the same note of Divine praise and of self-depletion as they prepare the way of the Lord to human hearts. They hide themselves behind the greater glory of their Lord. However considerable their powers, they are serviceable only as they contribute to the glory, and succeed in unveiling the thee, of their Lord. There is a Johannine message still required to disturb the fleshly equanimity and to break up the narcotized sleep of the unbeliever. The stern spirit of rebuke and warning is still indispensable; yet the voice of him that cries, "Repent!" knows that his voice may fade away into faint echoes and stillness, so soon as the promises of redemption and salvation are uttered by the Divine Lord. When the absolution of grace gives the kiss of peace to the broken-hearted, the morning star fades into the dawning of the day. </body></html>
