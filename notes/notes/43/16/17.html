But the sorrows of the disciples would soon be turned into joy; as those of a mother, at the sight of her infant. The Holy Spirit would be their Comforter, and neither men nor devils, neither sufferings in life nor in death, would ever deprive them of their joy. Believers have joy or sorrow, according to their sight of Christ, and the tokens of his presence. Sorrow is coming on the ungodly, which nothing can lessen; the believer is an heir to joy which no one can take away. Where now is the joy of the murderers of our Lord, and the sorrow of his friends?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A little while - His death would occur in a short time.

Compare <a href="/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33</a>.

A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father&#8212;The joy of the world at their not seeing Him seems to show that His removal from them by death was what He meant; and in that case, their joy at again seeing Him points to their transport at His reappearance amongst them on His Resurrection, when they could no longer doubt His identity. At the same time the sorrow of the widowed Church in the absence of her Lord in the heavens, and her transport at His personal return, are certainly here expressed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ had used much the same expression to the Jews, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet a little while I am with you; </span> he had spoken the same to his disciples, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you.

It may be, some of them might better understand the meaning of Christ than others, or they might all be ignorant of it; for before the effusion of the Spirit on them, they were attended with a great deal of ignorance; and what through their being overwhelmed at this time with sorrow, and what with their national sentiments they retained about a temporal kingdom, they understood very little of what Christ said to them concerning his death, the nature, use, and end of it. Wherefore some might make the motion first, and inquire, <p>what is this that he saith unto us, a little while and ye shall not see me? they knew not what he meant by it, though he had so often and so clearly spoken of his death unto them: and as ignorant were they what he should design by saying, <p>and again a little while and ye shall see me; though he had expressly told them, in so many words, some time ago, that whereas he should die, he should rise again the third day: and as much at a loss were they to guess what he should intend by the reason he gives, <p>and because I go to the Father; though he had often mentioned it already, and as what might be matter of joy unto them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/16-17.htm" title="Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?...">John 16:17-18</a>.
