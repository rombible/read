The thought is rather, “I do not speak of praying for you, because in the presence of the Advocate you will yourselves be able to pray in My name to the Father.” His prayer is thought of as not necessary for them, and yet the form of the words implies that He will pray for them if it should be needed.

Asking in Christ's name, is acknowledging our unworthiness to receive any favours from God, and shows full dependence upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness. Our Lord had hitherto spoken in short and weighty sentences, or in parables, the import of which the disciples did not fully understand, but after his resurrection he intended plainly to teach them such things as related to the Father and the way to him, through his intercession. And the frequency with which our Lord enforces offering up petitions in his name, shows that the great end of the mediation of Christ is to impress us with a deep sense of our sinfulness, and of the merit and power of his death, whereby we have access to God. And let us ever remember, that to address the Father in the name of Christ, or to address the Son as God dwelling in human nature, and reconciling the world to himself, are the same, as the Father and Son are one.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I say not unto you that I will pray ... - In <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>, Jesus says that he would pray the Father, and that he would send the Comforter. In <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17.htm">John 17</a> he offered a memorable prayer for them. In <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, it is said that Jesus ever liveth to make intercession for us; and it is constantly represented in the New Testament that it is by his intercession in heaven now that we obtain the blessings of pardon, peace, strength, and salvation. Compare <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>. This declaration of Jesus, then, does not mean that he would not intercede for them, but that there was no need then of his mentioning it to them again. They knew that; and, in addition to that, he told them that God was ready and willing to confer on them all needful blessings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

For when the Spirit was poured upon them, they not only received his extraordinary gifts, and had a larger measure of his grace bestowed upon them; but were also blessed with him, as a spirit of grace and supplication, in a more remarkable manner than ever they had been before: they then better understood the throne of grace, and the advantages of it; had greater enlargements and assistances at it; and were better acquainted with the mediation of Christ, and the necessity of making use of his name, blood, and righteousness, in all their petitions and requests. <p>And I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you. This Christ had promised before, <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>; nor was there any occasion to repeat it now, of which they might be strongly assured: besides, at that day the Spirit would be given to them by virtue of his intercession; so that there would be no need of praying to the Father for them on that account. This is said, not as if the intercession of Christ for his people would then cease; for he is always their advocate with the Father, and ever lives to make intercession for them; though it may not be carried on in the same manner, by prayer, as when he was here on earth, his personal appearance, and the presentation of his blood, sacrifice, and righteousness, being sufficient; but to declare the disposition and readiness of his Father to hear them, and grant unto them whatsoever they should ask of him in his name. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</span><p>(8) The sum of the worship of God is the invocation of the Father in the name of the Son the mediator, who is already heard for us, for whom he both abased himself, and is now also glorified.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/16-26.htm" title="At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:...">John 16:26-27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ὀν</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἰτήσ</span>.] Because enlightened by the Paraclete.

II. 1, p. 543, incorrectly explains them from the standpoint of the Parousia, from which a glance is taken backwards to the love that has been borne to the close. The entire promise has nothing to do with the Parousia; see on <a href="/john/16-16.htm" title="A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.">John 16:16</a>; <a href="/john/16-22.htm" title="And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.">John 16:22</a>; <a href="/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐξῆλθον</span>] See on <a href="/john/8-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.">John 8:42</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[183] “For thou comest not in thine own name, work, or merit, but on this, that it is announced to thee by the Holy Spirit what God’s will and command is, which He has performed through Christ,” Luther.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/16-26.htm" title="At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:">John 16:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ</span>. “In that day,” in which I shall tell you plainly of the Father (<a href="/john/16-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.">John 16:25</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἔρχεται ὥρα</span>), “ye shall ask in my name”; this is the natural consequence of their increased knowledge of the Father. <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ λέγω</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐξῆλθον</span> “And I do no say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you”—<span class="greekheb">περί</span>, almost equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>, here and in <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1 John 4:10</a>, “in relation to,” almost “in behalf of”—(<a href="/john/16-27.htm" title="For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.">John 16:27</a>) “for the Father Himself loves you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God”. The intention of the statement is to convey fuller assurance that their prayers will be answered. The Father’s love needs no prompting. Yet the intercession of Christ, so emphatically presented in the Epistle to the Hebrews and in <a href="/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>, is not ignored. Jesus says: “I do not base the expectation of answer <span class="ital">solely</span> on my intercession, but on the Father’s love, a love which itself is quickened and evoked by your love for me”. “I do not say that I will ask” means “I do not press this,” “I do not bring this forward as the sole reason why you may expect to be heard”. The mediation of Christ has here its incidence at an earlier stage than in the Apostolic statements. The love of God is represented as intensified towards those who have accepted Christ as the revealer of the Father.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">At that day</span>] As in <span class="ital"><a href="/john/16-23.htm" title="And in that day you shall ask me nothing.

The meaning rather is, that so long as through the power of the Advocate they have direct communion with the Father in Christ’s name, there is no need to speak of Christ’s intercession. But this communion may be interrupted by sin, and then Christ becomes their Advocate (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

The opportunity will come when all my Name will be appreciated by you, and your spiritual reception of me will teach you to approach the Father, who is thus revealed to you. Calvin in these verses calls attention to the familiarity of Israel with the idea of a Mediator, one by whom they drew near to God, and that Christ places himself here in the stead of the whole propitiatory service and ritual of the temple. "His Name" was the Divine equivalent of all the work of the high priest from one Day of Atonement to another and for evermore. <span class="cmt_word">And I do not say to you, that I will make my request to the Father concerning you</span> (see note on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, Ver. 23, etc.). It will not do to argue, with Grotius, that this is just as if he had said, "To say nothing of my own intercessions for you," or, "You may take these for granted;" because the very next verse gives his reason for the assertion. Nor is it satisfactory to say, with Meyer, that the "prayers" of which he speaks (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>; <a href="/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9, 20</a>) are <span class="accented">before</span> the gift of the Paraclete, and not inconsistent with the higher condition of the disciples after the Paraclete should have been given; because John had received the Paraclete when he wrote, "We have an Advocate with the Father" (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>). Nor can we suppose that the great utterances of <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-25.htm">Hebrews 9:25</a> are vain imaginations, and that there is no sense in which the Lord does augment and complete our prayers, taking them upon his heart and going in his high-priestly prerogative into the holy place with his own blood; but the words must nevertheless be pressed, and their meaning held to be compatible with what Paul and John say of the" intercession of Christ." They reveal the perfect access to the Father's heart which he has secured for his disciples, the full reconciliation effected as well as devised and consummated by the Father's own love (cf. <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>, "By Christ we both [Jew and Gentile] have access (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) in one <span class="accented">spirit to the Father"</span>). The end of the whole ministry of Christ is, in the power of the Holy Ghost's revelation of him, to bring men to the Father and let them know it. There is no need that Christ should (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) make special prayer to the Father, as though he were merciful and the Father needed to be appeased towards those for whom he had prepared so great a salvation (see <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>, where Philippi, Calvin, and others show that Christ's <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is the effect of his own glorious and eternal work). His appearance in the presence of God for us is the perpetual pledge of the completeness of his sacrifice. These very passages in Hebrews and Romans have to be interpreted in harmony with this great statement of his own, viz. that there is no reason to ask the Father concerning them; all has been asked and answered, the intercession is complete; his whole work will have reconciled the Father with his children, and that by reason of the Father's own love. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye shall ask - I will pray<p>Note again the use of the two verbs for asking.
