But the sorrows of the disciples would soon be turned into joy; as those of a mother, at the sight of her infant. The Holy Spirit would be their Comforter, and neither men nor devils, neither sufferings in life nor in death, would ever deprive them of their joy. Believers have joy or sorrow, according to their sight of Christ, and the tokens of his presence. Sorrow is coming on the ungodly, which nothing can lessen; the believer is an heir to joy which no one can take away. Where now is the joy of the murderers of our Lord, and the sorrow of his friends?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A little while - His death would occur in a short time. It took place the next day. See <a href="/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>.<p>Ye shall not see me - That is, he would be concealed from their view in the tomb.<p>And again a little while - After three days he would rise again and appear to their view.<p>Because I go ... - Because it is a part of the plan that I should ascend to God, it is necessary that I should rise from the grave, and then you will see me, and have evidence that I am still your Friend. Compare <a href="/john/7-33.htm">John 7:33</a>. Here are three important events foretold for the consolation of the disciples; yet they were stated in such a manner that, in their circumstances and with their prejudices, it appeared difficult to understand him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-22. A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father&#8212;The joy of the world at their not seeing Him seems to show that His removal from them by death was what He meant; and in that case, their joy at again seeing Him points to their transport at His reappearance amongst them on His Resurrection, when they could no longer doubt His identity. At the same time the sorrow of the widowed Church in the absence of her Lord in the heavens, and her transport at His personal return, are certainly here expressed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Still they do not understand what he meant. Who shall hereafter arrogate to man’s reason or understanding a power to comprehend spiritual mysteries? Had not the disciples reasonable souls? Will any say they had no mind to understand them? Certainly none can say so. Some lay the fault of the disciples not understanding these things upon the obscurity of our Saviour’s phrase, and his parabolical expression of them, others, in their ignorance of our Saviour’s resurrection from the dead; others, in their not understanding the circumstance of time: but certainly it is best imputed to the disciples inability to conceive of these things, and the prejudices of their national error concerning the temporal kingdom of the Messias. Let it lie where it will, the weakness of the disciples may be reasonably conceived not to be greater than is incident to the best of men; and if they were so dull of hearing and understanding, we may reasonably conceive that we are not free from the like impotency and infirmity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They said therefore,....
