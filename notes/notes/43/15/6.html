The union of the human and Divine natures, and the fulness of the Spirit that is in him, resemble the root of the vine made fruitful by the moisture from a rich soil. Believers are branches of this Vine. The root is unseen, and our life is hid with Christ; the root bears the tree, diffuses sap to it, and in Christ are all supports and supplies. The branches of the vine are many, yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus all true Christians, though in place and opinion distant from each other, meet in Christ. Believers, like the branches of the vine, are weak, and unable to stand but as they are borne up. The Father is the Husbandman. Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his vineyard, as God is about his church, which therefore must prosper. We must be fruitful. From a vine we look for grapes, and from a Christian we look for a Christian temper, disposition, and life. We must honour God, and do good; this is bearing fruit. The unfruitful are taken away. And even fruitful branches need pruning; for the best have notions, passions, and humours, that require to be taken away, which Christ has promised to forward the sanctification of believers, they will be thankful, for them. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good, the more our Lord is glorified. In order to fruitfulness, we must abide in Christ, must have union with him by faith. It is the great concern of all Christ's disciples, constantly to keep up dependence upon Christ, and communion with him. True Christians find by experience, that any interruption in the exercise of their faith, causes holy affections to decline, their corruptions to revive, and their comforts to droop. Those who abide not in Christ, though they may flourish for awhile in outward profession, yet come to nothing. The fire is the fittest place for withered branches; they are good for nothing else. Let us seek to live more simply on the fulness of Christ, and to grow more fruitful in every good word and work, so may our joy in Him and in his salvation be full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If a man, abide not in me - See <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>.

So of a soul unconnected with Christ, however fair it may have appeared. and however flourishing when a profession of religion was first made, yet when it is tried, and it is seen that there was no true grace, everything withers and dies. The zeal languishes, the professed love is gone, prayer is neglected, the sanctuary is forsaken, and the soul becomes like a withered branch reserved for the fire of the last great day.

How awfully striking the figure, in this view of it!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Our Lord yet pursueth the metaphor of the vine, the branches, and the husbandman: Look (saith he) its it is with a vine, when the time of pruning the vine cometh, the vine dresser cutteth off the fruitless, luxuriant branches, and throws them by; which being done, their greenness presently abates, and they wither, and after a time some come and gather them up, and cast them into some fire, where they are burned: so it will be with you; if you do not bring forth fruit, God will take from you his common influences, which have for a while made you to look speciously; and your profession, or your parts and gifts, will wither and decay; and in the day of judgment the angels shall gather you up, and God shall cast you into hell, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/13-40.htm" title="As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.">Matthew 13:40</a>,41</span>, where you shall perish as miserably, nay, infinitely more miserably, than if you were burned with fire. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If a man abide not in me,.... Christ does not say, "if ye abide not in me"; he would not suppose this of his true disciples; Judas now being removed, to whom he may have some respect in this verse; though it may be applied to anyone who has made a profession of Christ, and denies the truths of the Gospel, neglects the ordinances of it, or walks unworthy of his profession: of whom the following things may be truly said, <p>he is cast forth as a branch; that is unfruitful, and is therefore taken away from the vine, and cast forth out of the vineyard. This signifies the ejection of worthless and fruitless professors out of the churches; for such who are either unsound in their principles, or are remiss and negligent in their attendance on the worship of God, with the church, or are loose and vain in their lives and conversations, are to be removed from communion with the people of God. <p>And is withered. Some versions, as the Arabic, Syriac, and Persic, read this as an epithet of the word "branch", thus; "the branch that is withered"; expressing the condition the branch is in before it is cast forth out of the vineyard, and the reason of its being cast forth: but others read it as a new and distinct predicate of the branch, showing the case it is in, immediately upon its being cast forth: it may be cut off, and cast out with its leaves upon it, though without fruit; but as soon as ever it is ejected, it withers away. So mere external professors of religion, when they are cast out, of the communion of the church, presently the leaf of profession, which once seemed green, decays, loses its verdure, and that seeming fruit which grew upon them shrinks to nothing, and they become "trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit", Jde 1:12, their show of life, zeal, religion, and holiness, disappears, and all their external gifts, light, knowledge, and understanding, even in a speculative way, vanish: <p>and men gather them; or, as some copies have it,  "it", which best agrees with the word "branch". This was a common thing, when branches were thrown out of a vineyard, for men to come and gather them up for an use hereafter mentioned. So when unworthy members are put out of a church of Christ, the men of the world gather them into their society: or they are taken into the congregations of false teachers, who being sensual, and without the Spirit, separate themselves; or it may be read impersonally, "they are gathered", or "it is gathered": so wicked men, and Christless professors, will be gathered by the angels at the last day, and severed by them from the righteous, whom they will place at Christ's left hand to receive their awful doom: <p>and cast them, or "it", <p>into the fire, and they are burned, or "it is burned"; for nothing else is such a branch good for; see <a href="/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a>. This may respect either the gnawings of conscience, that distress of mind, if not despair, that fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which attend apostates in this life; or their being cast into the everlasting burnings of hell fire by angels at the last day, as will be the case of every unfruitful tree, of the chaff and tares. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/15-6.htm" title="If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.">John 15:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Νῦν λέγει καὶ τὸν κίνδυνον τοῦ μὴ ἐν αὐτῷ μένοντος</span>, Euth.

Jesus places Himself <span class="ital">at the point of time of the execution of the last judgment</span>, when those who have fallen away from Him are gathered together and cast into the fire, after they have been <span class="ital">previously</span> already cast out of His communion, and become withered (having completely lost the higher true <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>). Hence the graphic lively change of tense: <span class="ital">In case any one shall not have abided on me; he has been cast out like the branch, and is withered</span> (already <span class="ital">before</span> the judgment), <span class="ital">and</span> (now what <span class="ital">takes place at the last day itself</span>) <span class="ital">they gather them together</span>, etc. The <span class="ital">aorists</span> therefore neither denote what is wont to be (Grotius), nor do they stand for futures (Kuinoel, B. Crusius, and older expositors), nor are they to be explained “par la <span class="ital">répétition de l’acte</span> aussi longtemps que dure l’opération de la taille” (Godet); nor are they designed, as in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>, to express that which is at once done or appointed to be done with the non-abiding (so most expositors, including Lücke, Winer, Tholuck, De Wette, Luthardt, Weiss, Hengstenberg; comp. Hermann, <span class="ital">de emend. Grammat</span>. p. 192 f.; Buttmann, <span class="ital">N. T. Gram</span>. p. 172 [E. T. p. 199]). To the latter interpretation is opposed the circumstance that, in point of fact, the being cast out and being withered cannot be appointed or effected immediately at and with the falling away, but that conversion and re-adoption must remain open (comp. <span class="greekheb">ἡ πρόσληψις</span>, <a href="/romans/11-15.htm" title="For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?">Romans 11:15</a>), if <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν μή τις</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is not to have in view the time of the judgment at the last day. The <span class="greekheb">ἐβλήθη</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. appears as a definite result and as a completed <span class="ital">Acts of the past</span>,[162] and that, as the further pictorial description, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνάγουσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., shows, from the standpoint <span class="ital">of the last day</span> (comp. also <a href="/hebrews/6-8.htm" title="But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is near to cursing; whose end is to be burned.">Hebrews 6:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm" title="But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.">Hebrews 10:27</a>), and further in such a way that it is accomplished between the beginning of the falling away and the last day on which the gathering together and burning is now performed.[163]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς τὸ κλῆμα</span>] <span class="ital">as the branch</span>, which has not remained on the vine, but has been broken off or cut off, and cast out of the vineyard.

This consequence follows so inevitably that to state the one is to state the other. The same remark applies to ‘is withered.’ But the cast-out branch may be grafted in again (<a href="/romans/11-23.htm" title="And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.">Romans 11:23</a>) and the dead branch may be raised to life again (<a href="/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a>; <a href="/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>). The rest of the picture looks forward to the day of judgment. ‘Men gather’ should be quite indefinitely, <span class="bld">they</span> <span class="ital">gather</span> (see on <a href="/luke/12-20.htm" title="But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?">Luke 12:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they are burned</span>] Or, <span class="ital">they burn</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/15-6.htm" title="If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.">John 15:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ἐμοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">in Me</span>) as in the vine.—<span class="greekheb">ἐβλήθη</span>) By that very fact he is (he renders himself) deserving of being cast out: and accordingly <span class="ital">he shall</span> surely <span class="ital">be cast out</span>. The first Aorist. The expression <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν μὴ μείνῃ</span>, <span class="ital">if a man shall not abide in Me</span>, is in the Future: and so in the Apodosis the <span class="greekheb">ἐβλήθη</span>, [“He is at once cast out”] denotes that which forthwith ensues. A similar Aorist, <span class="greekheb">ἐκέρδησας</span>, “If he <span class="ital">shall hear</span> thee, thou <span class="ital">hast</span> (by the very fact) <span class="ital">gained</span> thy brother,” occurs in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἔξω</span>, <span class="ital">out</span>) from the vineyard.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξηράνθη</span>, <span class="ital">he is withered</span>) as a branch cast into the highway.

The two aorists, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, are simply cases of a common daily experience. These are the inevitable consequences of not abiding in the Vine. We may imagine two ways in which this non-abiding in Christ, this severance from him, may be effected: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the pruning-knife may have lopped them off because of their lack of fruitfulness; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> they may have withered on the stem, and, by their deficiency of strength and life, have suffered from some external assault which they have not had energy to resist. Lucke, Winer, Tholuck, and Hengstenberg regard the aorists as indicative of what will happen should branches in Christ cease to derive life from him. Calvin is satisfied that the expression cannot refer to the elect, but to the hypocrite, while Alford is as confident of its repudiation of unconditional election. In my opinion it keeps clear of both suggestions. <span class="cmt_word">And they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> The vine is one of the noblest of all trees, and produces the most abundant fruit; but it is one of its peculiarities that all its strength is spent on the fruit, and that its branches are utterly valueless for all other purposes. Heaps of burning vine-prunings may have suggested the awful image which the embodied Love of God here adopts. Some have supposed (Meyer and Alford) that the fire is here the last judgment, which our Lord looks upon as come. But the present tense, following the two aorists, suggests the immediate consequence of such severance from Christ - the fiery trials, the fierce temptations, the terrible judgments, always overtaking the unfruitful and unfaithful servants, and preluding the awful consummation of Divine judgment, of which our Lord had often spoken (<a href="/matthew/13-42.htm">Matthew 13:42, 50</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>), and which the apostle of love described in <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He is cast forth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;)<p>The aorist tense. Literally, was cast forth. The aorist, denoting a momentary act, indicates that it was cast forth at the moment it ceased to abide in the vine.
