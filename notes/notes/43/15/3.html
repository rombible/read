Satan’s agents and emissaries will insnare and make an easy prey of them; for they that fall off from Christ soon fall in with sinners, are associated with them, and employed in the unfruitful works of darkness; so that they become fit fuel for the divine wrath, from which the profession they formerly made will not preserve them. <span class="ital">And they are burned </span>— This follows of course; but it is here added very emphatically, and makes the threatening very terrible.

The union of the human and Divine natures, and the fulness of the Spirit that is in him, resemble the root of the vine made fruitful by the moisture from a rich soil. Believers are branches of this Vine. The root is unseen, and our life is hid with Christ; the root bears the tree, diffuses sap to it, and in Christ are all supports and supplies. The branches of the vine are many, yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus all true Christians, though in place and opinion distant from each other, meet in Christ. Believers, like the branches of the vine, are weak, and unable to stand but as they are borne up. The Father is the Husbandman. Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his vineyard, as God is about his church, which therefore must prosper. We must be fruitful. From a vine we look for grapes, and from a Christian we look for a Christian temper, disposition, and life. We must honour God, and do good; this is bearing fruit. The unfruitful are taken away. And even fruitful branches need pruning; for the best have notions, passions, and humours, that require to be taken away, which Christ has promised to forward the sanctification of believers, they will be thankful, for them. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good, the more our Lord is glorified. In order to fruitfulness, we must abide in Christ, must have union with him by faith. It is the great concern of all Christ's disciples, constantly to keep up dependence upon Christ, and communion with him. True Christians find by experience, that any interruption in the exercise of their faith, causes holy affections to decline, their corruptions to revive, and their comforts to droop. Those who abide not in Christ, though they may flourish for awhile in outward profession, yet come to nothing. The fire is the fittest place for withered branches; they are good for nothing else. Let us seek to live more simply on the fulness of Christ, and to grow more fruitful in every good word and work, so may our joy in Him and in his salvation be full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now ye are clean - Still keeping up the figure &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  katharoi. It does not mean that they were perfect, but that they had been under a process of purifying by his instructions all the time he had been with them. He had removed their erroneous notions of the Messiah; he had gradually reclaimed them from their fond and foolish views respecting earthly honors; he had taught them to be willing to forsake all things; and he had so trained and disciplined them that immediately after his death they would be ready to go and bear fruit among all nations to the honor of his name.

Our cleansing is in holy writ attributed sometimes to the blood of Christ, sometimes to the Spirit, sometimes to the word.

These words being inserted in the discourse concerning the vine and branches, and the pruning and purging them to make them fruitful, are thought, by the learned Dr. Lightfoot, to be an allusion to the law in <a href="/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>; by which the fruit of trees, for the first three years, were accounted uncircumcised or unclean, and in the fourth year fit for use; concerning which the Talmudists have a whole tract, called  "Orla"; the apostles having enjoyed the ministry of Christ, and been his disciples about such a time. Though the "now" seems to refer to the removal and taking away of that withered and unfruitful branch, Judas. Christ, in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>, had told his disciples, that they "were clean, but not all", because the betrayer was among them; but he being discovered by Christ, and ordered by him to be gone, went out from among them about his wicked design; and now Christ could say of them all, that they were clean: which may be understood of their regeneration and sanctification, in which their hearts were sprinkled with clean water; were washed with the washing of regeneration; had their hearts purified by faith in the blood of Christ, and had pure principles of grace formed in their souls; of all which the Gospel of Christ was the instrumental means: or of their justification by the righteousness of Christ, by which they were justified from all sin; and were all fair, and without spot; which was through the Gospel of Christ revealing his righteousness to them, or through the sentence of justification he, by his Spirit, passed upon their consciences. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/15-3.htm" title="Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.">John 15:3</a>.

The Word is in itself <span class="ital">altogether clean</span> or <span class="ital">pure</span>: owing to this it imparts <span class="ital">cleanness</span> (purity), or holiness, to the disciples. Comp. the use of <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span> (<span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα ἐλέους Θεοῦ ἡμῶν</span>, ‘<span class="ital">through</span>,’ i.e. “<span class="ital">owing to</span> the tender mercy of our God”), <a href="/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now ye are clean</span> - pruned, purged, cleansed, of the Divine Owner - <span class="cmt_word">by reason of the word</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">which I have spoken to you</span>.

As we find in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, the Word is sharper than a two-edged sword, and capable of dealing summarily with "thoughts and intents of the heart." Augustine, on this passage, admits that it is the <span class="accented">Logos</span> which gives all its value to the water of baptism. "This purifying, sanctifying process has been performed upon you," says Christ. Then since "he who sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one," this continuance remains as the gracious possibility. The vital sap proceeds from Christ alone, and not from our corrupted nature, which must be grafted into his life and become part of him. Many may seem to be a part of Christ, to be sacramentally or outwardly united to him, and even to be drawing some real advantages from the contact, and yet their end is fruitlessness, rottenness, removal, fire. The branches which bear fruit never bring forth all they might produce, never realize their ideal. The pruning, cleansing process must pass over every soul, that it may more adequately fulfill its destiny. The cleansing, searching power of the Word will be freely exercised by the Divine Husbandman. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Clean (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Etymologically akin to &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, purgeth.
