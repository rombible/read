We are not to interpret these words, as they frequently have been interpreted, of the unbelieving world, or of the Jews; but of Christians in name, who claim to be branches of the true vine. These the Husbandman watcheth day by day; He knoweth them, and readeth the inner realities of their lives, and every one that is fruitless He taketh away.<p><span class= "bld">And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">he cleanseth it.</span> (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>.) This means in the natural vine the cutting off of shoots which run to waste, and the removal of every excrescence which hinders the growth of the branch. It means in the spiritual training the checking of natural impulses and affections, and the removal of everything, even though it be by a pang sharp as the edge of the pruner’s knife, which can misdirect or weaken the energy of the spiritual life, and thus diminish its fruitfulness. A vine which has been pruned—here a tendril cut off, and there one bent back—here a shoot that seemed of fairest promise to the unskilled eye unsparingly severed by the vine-dresser, who sees it is worthless—here a branch, in itself good, made to yield its place to one that is better, and itself trained to fill another place—such is the familiar picture of the natural vine—such, also, to a wisdom higher than ours, is the picture of human life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/john/15-2.htm" title="Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit.">John 15:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Every branch in me </span>— True believers, who by faith have an interest in, and union with Christ, are the branches of the vine here spoken of. Though, as to the place of their abode, their religious sentiments in lesser matters, and their modes of worship, they may be distant from each other, yet they meet in Christ, their root and stock, and the centre of their unity. <span class="ital">That beareth not fruit </span>— Answerable to his advantages, fruit suitable to the relation in which he stands to me, and the union which by faith he has had with me: he whose faith in me and my gospel does not work or continue to work by love, and whose love does not continue to manifest itself by his obedience; he who does not bring forth, with constancy and perseverance, the internal and external fruits of the Spirit, namely, <span class="ital">all goodness, righteousness, and truth, </span><a href="/ephesians/5-9.htm" title="(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <span class="ital">he taketh away </span>— Such unfruitful branches the vine-dresser cuts off in his righteous judgment, and entirely separates them from me, depriving them of all the advantages for fruitfulness, which they derived, or might have derived, from their connection with me, and their reception of my truth and grace. <span class="ital">And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">pruneth it, </span>cuts off from it every thing superfluous, and removes all the hinderances of its fruitfulness. Thus God, in the course of his providence, by various sufferings in the minds, bodies, families, circumstances, and situations of his people, and by his word, and their faith therein, and obedience thereto, (<a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a>;) and by the influence of his Spirit, mortifies and destroys what is still corrupt in their affections and dispositions, with what remains in them of the carnal mind, and prevents their bearing fruit to perfection. <span class="ital">That it may bring forth more fruit </span>— Than it brought forth before, to God’s greater glory, the greater benefit of mankind, and their own greater progress in holiness here, and a fuller reward of felicity and glory hereafter. Dr. Campbell reads the verse, <span class="ital">Every barren branch in me he loppeth off: every fruitful branch he cleaneth, by pruning, to render it more fruitful: </span>remarking upon it as follows: “Critics have observed a verbal allusion or paronomasia in this verse. To the barren branch the word <span class="greekheb">αιρει</span>, [<span class="ital">he loppeth off,</span>] is applied; to the fruitful, <span class="greekheb">καθαιρει</span>, [<span class="ital">he cleaneth by pruning.</span>] It is not always possible in a version to preserve figures which depend entirely on the sound, or on the etymology of the words, though sometimes they are not without emphasis. This verse and the following afford a remarkable instance of this trope. As our Lord himself is here represented by the vine, his disciples are represented by the branches. The mention of the method which the dresser takes with the fruitful branches, in order to render them more fruitful, and which he expresses by the word <span class="greekheb">καθαιρει</span>, leads him to take notice of the state wherein the apostles, the principal branches, were at that time: <span class="greekheb">ηδη υμεις καθαροι</span>, &c., <span class="ital">now are ye clean, </span>&c. It is hardly possible not to consider the <span class="greekheb">καθαιρει</span>, applied to the branches, as giving occasion to this remark, which immediately follows it. Now, when the train of the thoughts arises in any degree from verbal allusions, it is of some consequence to preserve them, where it can be easily effected in a translation. It is for this reason that I have translated the word <span class="greekheb">καθαιρει </span>by a circumlocution, and said <span class="ital">cleaneth by pruning. </span>It is evident, that <span class="greekheb">καθαιρει</span>, in this application, means <span class="ital">pruneth. </span>But to have said in English, simply, <span class="ital">pruneth, </span>would have been to throw away the allusion, and make the thoughts appear more abrupt in the version than they do in the original; and to have said <span class="ital">cleaneth, </span>without adding any explanation, would have been obscure, or rather improper.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 Jesus Christ is the Vine, the true Vine. The union of the human and Divine natures, and the fulness of the Spirit that is in him, resemble the root of the vine made fruitful by the moisture from a rich soil. Believers are branches of this Vine. The root is unseen, and our life is hid with Christ; the root bears the tree, diffuses sap to it, and in Christ are all supports and supplies. The branches of the vine are many, yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus all true Christians, though in place and opinion distant from each other, meet in Christ. Believers, like the branches of the vine, are weak, and unable to stand but as they are borne up. The Father is the Husbandman. Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his vineyard, as God is about his church, which therefore must prosper. We must be fruitful. From a vine we look for grapes, and from a Christian we look for a Christian temper, disposition, and life. We must honour God, and do good; this is bearing fruit. The unfruitful are taken away. And even fruitful branches need pruning; for the best have notions, passions, and humours, that require to be taken away, which Christ has promised to forward the sanctification of believers, they will be thankful, for them. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good, the more our Lord is glorified. In order to fruitfulness, we must abide in Christ, must have union with him by faith. It is the great concern of all Christ's disciples, constantly to keep up dependence upon Christ, and communion with him. True Christians find by experience, that any interruption in the exercise of their faith, causes holy affections to decline, their corruptions to revive, and their comforts to droop. Those who abide not in Christ, though they may flourish for awhile in outward profession, yet come to nothing. The fire is the fittest place for withered branches; they are good for nothing else. Let us seek to live more simply on the fulness of Christ, and to grow more fruitful in every good word and work, so may our joy in Him and in his salvation be full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every branch in me - Everyone that is a true follower of me, that is united to me by faith, and that truly derives grace and strength from me, as the branch does from the vine. The word "branch" includes all the boughs, and the smallest tendrils that shoot out from the parent stalk. Jesus here says that he sustains the same relation to his disciples that a parent stalk does to the branches; but this does not denote any physical or incomprehensible union. It is a union formed by believing on him; resulting from our feeling our dependence on him and our need of him; from embracing him as our Saviour, Redeemer, and Friend. We become united to him in all our interests, and have common feelings, common desires, and a common destiny with him. We seek the same objects, are willing to encounter the same trials, contempt, persecution, and want, and are desirous that his God shall be ours, and his eternal abode ours. It is a union of friendship, of love, and of dependence; a union of weakness with strength; of imperfection with perfection; of a dying nature with a living Saviour; of a lost sinner with an unchanging Friend and Redeemer. It is the most tender and interesting of all relations, but not more mysterious or more physical than the union of parent and child, of husband and wife <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, or friend and friend.<p>That beareth not fruit - As the vinedresser will remove all branches that are dead or that bear no fruit, so will God take from his church all professed Christians who give no evidence by their lives that they are truly united to the Lord Jesus. He here refers to such cases as that of Judas, the apostatizing disciples, and all false and merely nominal Christians (Dr. Adam Clarke).<p>He taketh away - The vine-dresser cuts it off. God removes such in various ways:<p>1. by the discipline of the church.<p>2. by suffering them to fall into temptation.<p>3. by persecution and tribulation, by the deceitfulness of riches, and by the cares of the world <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/13-21.htm">Matthew 13:21-22</a>; by suffering the man to be placed in such circumstances as Judas, Achan, and Ananias were such as to show what they were, to bring their characters fairly out, and to let it be seen that they had no true love to God.<p>4. by death, for God has power thus at any moment to remove unprofitable branches from the church.<p>Every branch that beareth fruit - That is, all true Christians, for all such bear fruit. To bear fruit is to show by our lives that we are under the influence of the religion of Christ, and that that religion produces in us its appropriate effects, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. Notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>. It is also to live so as to be useful to others, As a vineyard is worthless unless it bears fruit that may promote the happiness or subsistence of man, so the Christian principle would be worthless unless Christians should live so that others may be made holy and happy by their example and labors, and so that the world may be brought to the cross of the Saviour.<p>He purgeth it - Or rather he prunes it, or cleanses it by pruning. There is a use of words here - a paronomasia - in the original which cannot be retained in the translation. It may be imperfectly seen by retaining the Greek words "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  airei; every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  kathairei; now ye are clean &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  katharoi," etc. The same Greek word in different forms is still retained. God purifies all true Christians so that they may be more useful. He takes away that which hindered their usefulness; teaches them; quickens them; revives them; makes them more pure in motive and in life. This he does by the regular influences of his Spirit in sanctifying them, purifying their motives, teaching them the beauty of holiness, and inducing them to devote themselves more to him. He does it by taking away what opposes their usefulness, however much they may be attached to it, or however painful to part with it; as a vine-dresser will often feel himself compelled to lop off a branch that is large, apparently thrifty, and handsome, but which bears no fruit, and which shades or injures those which do. So God often takes away the property of his people, their children, or other idols. He removes the objects which bind their affections, and which render them inactive. He takes away the things around man, as he did the valued gourds of Jonah Jon 4:5-11, so that he may feel his dependence, and live more to the honor of God, and bring forth more proof of humble and active piety. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit &#8230; every branch that beareth fruit&#8212;As in a fruit tree, some branches may be fruitful, others quite barren, according as there is a vital connection between the branch and the stock, or no vital connection; so the disciples of Christ may be spiritually fruitful or the reverse, according as they are vitally and spiritually connected with Christ, or but externally and mechanically attached to Him. The fruitless He "taketh away" (see on [1857]Joh 15:6); the fruitful He "purgeth" (cleanseth, pruneth)&#8212;stripping it, as the husbandman does, of what is rank (Mr 4:19), "that it may bring forth more fruit"; a process often painful, but no less needful and beneficial than in the natural husbandry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> And concerning his Father’s care, he tells us, that as the good vine dresser cutteth off those branches in the vine which bring forth no fruit, so his Father will take away such branches in him as bring forth no fruit. But here ariseth a question, viz. Whether, or how, any can be branches in Christ, and yet bring forth no fruit? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Some say, there is no need of translating the words so, which may as well be translated, Every branch not bringing forth fruit in me. Indeed no true fruit can be brought forth but in Christ; but yet much that looks like fruit, much that men may call fruit, may be brought forth without any true spiritual union with Christ. All acts of moral discipline, or any acts of formal profession in religion, may be brought forth without any true root and foundation in Christ; and God will in the end discover and cut off those who bring forth no other fruit. But: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Men may be said to be branches in him, by a sacramental implantation, being baptized into him, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a></span>; and are hereby members of the visible church, and make a visible profession of adhering to him, with respect to their own good opinion and persuasions of themselves, though they be not so in respect of any true, spiritual, and real implantation. But those who in the last sense are not in him, bring forth no fruit unto perfection, and God will cut them off, either by withdrawing his restraining grace, and giving them up to strong delusions to believe lies; or to a reprobate mind, and vile lusts and affections; or by taking away their gifts; or some way or other, so as they shall never have an eternal communion with God in glory. But if any man bringeth forth true spiritual fruit in Christ, him God the Father will purge, by the sprinkling of Christ’s blood yet further upon his conscience, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a></span>; and by his Holy Spirit working on him like fire, to purge away his dross, and like water, to purge away his filth; and by his word, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1 Peter 1:22</a></span>, by faith, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/15-9.htm" title="And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.">Acts 15:9</a></span>, by crosses and trials. <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm" title="And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:">Isaiah 1:25</a> <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a></span>; that he may be more fruitful in works of holiness and righteousness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit,.... There are two sorts of branches in Christ the vine; the one sort are such who have only an historical faith in him, believe but for a time, and are removed; they are such who only profess to believe in him, as Simon Magus did; are in him by profession only; they submit to outward ordinances, become church members, and so are reckoned to be in Christ, being in a church state, as the churches of Judea and Thessalonica, and others, are said, in general, to he in Christ; though it is not to be thought that every individual person in these churches were truly and savingly in him. These branches are unfruitful ones; what fruit they seemed to have, withers away, and proves not to be genuine fruit; what fruit they bring forth is to themselves, and not to the glory of God, being none of the fruits of his Spirit and grace: and such branches the husbandman <p>taketh away; removes them from that sort of being which they had in Christ. By some means or another he discovers them to the saints to be what they are; sometimes he suffers persecution to arise because of the word, and these men are quickly offended, and depart of their own accord; or they fall into erroneous principles, and set up for themselves, and separate from the churches of Christ; or they become guilty of scandalous enormities, and so are removed from their fellowship by excommunication; or if neither of these should be the case, but these tares should grow together with the wheat till the harvest, the angels will be sent forth, who will gather out of the kingdom of God all that offend and do iniquity, and cast them into a furnace of fire, as branches withered, and fit to be burnt. <p>And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. These are the other sort of branches, who are truly and savingly in Christ; such as are rooted in him; to whom he is the green fir tree, from whom all their fruit is found; who are filled by him with all the fruits of his Spirit, grace, and righteousness. These are purged or pruned, chiefly by afflictions and temptations, which are as needful for their growth and fruitfulness, as the pruning and cutting of the vines are for theirs; and though these are sometimes sharp, and never joyous, but grievous, yet they are attended with the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and so the end of bringing forth more fruit is answered; for it is not enough that a believer exercise grace, and perform good works for the present, but these must remain; or he must be constant herein, and still bring forth fruit, and add one virtue to another, that it may appear he is not barren and unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ, in whom he is implanted. These different acts of the vinedresser "taking away" some branches, and "purging" others, are expressed by the Misnic doctors (p) by  and  The former, the commentators (q) say, signifies to cut off the branches that are withered and perished, and are good for nothing; and the latter signifies the pruning of the vine when it has a superfluity of branches, or these extend themselves too far; when some are left, and others taken off. <p>(p) Misn.

The function of the vinedresser is at once described: <span class="greekheb">πᾶν κλῆμα</span> … <span class="greekheb">φέρῃ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κλῆμα</span>, or more fully as in Xen., <span class="ital">Oecon.</span>, xix. 8, <span class="greekheb">κλῆμα ἀμπέλου</span>, is the shoot of the vine which is annually put forth. It is from <span class="greekheb">κλάω</span>, “I break,” as also is <span class="greekheb">κλάδος</span>, but Wetstein quotes Pollux to show that <span class="greekheb">κλάδος</span> was appropriated to the shoots of the olive, while <span class="greekheb">κλῆμα</span> signified a vine-shoot. Of these shoots there are two kinds, the fruitless, which the vine-dresser <span class="greekheb">αἴρει</span>: “Inutilesque falce ramos amputans,” Hor. <span class="ital">Epod.</span>, ii. 13; the fruitful, which He <span class="greekheb">καθαίρει</span> [“suavis rhythmus,” Bengel]. The full meaning of <span class="greekheb">αἴρει</span> is described in <a href="/john/15-6.htm" title="If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.">John 15:6</a> : <span class="greekheb">καθαίρει</span> here denotes especially the pruning requisite for concentrating the vigour of the tree on the one object, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πλείονα καρπὸν φέρῃ</span>, that it may continually surpass itself, and yield richer and richer results. The vine-dresser spares no pains and no material on his plants, but all for the sake of fruit. [<span class="ital">Cf.</span> Cicero, <span class="ital">De Senec.</span>, xv. 53.] The use of <span class="greekheb">καθαίρει</span> was probably determined by the <span class="greekheb">καθαροί</span> of <a href="/john/15-3.htm" title="Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.">John 15:3</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Every branch</span>] The word for ‘branch’ in these six verses occurs here only in N.T., and in classical Greek is specially used of the vine. The word used in the other Gospels (<a href="/matthew/13-32.htm" title="Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.">Matthew 13:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-8.htm" title="And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.">Matthew 21:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-32.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:">Matthew 24:32</a>; <a href="/mark/4-32.htm" title="But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.">Mark 4:32</a>; <a href="/mark/13-28.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:">Mark 13:28</a>; <a href="/luke/13-9.htm" title="And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.">Luke 13:9</a>), and in <a href="/context/romans/11-16.htm" title="For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches....">Romans 11:16-21</a>, is of the same origin (from ‘to break’) but of more general meaning,—the smaller branch of any tree. So that the very word used, independently of the context, fixes the meaning of the allegory. It is every <span class="ital">vine</span>-branch, i.e. every one who is by origin a <span class="ital">Christian</span>. If they continue such by origin only, and give forth no fruit, they are cut off. The allegory takes no account of the branches of other trees: neither Jews nor heathen are included. Christ would not have called them branches ‘in Me.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he taketh away</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">He taketh</span> <span class="bld">it</span> <span class="ital">away</span>; in both clauses we have a <span class="ital">nominativus pendens</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he purgeth it</span>] Better, <span class="ital">He</span> <span class="bld">cleanseth</span> <span class="ital">it</span>, in order to bring out the connexion with ‘ye are clean’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/john/15-3.htm" title="Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.">John 15:3</a></span>). The Greek words rendered ‘purgeth’ and ‘clean’ are from the same root. There is also a similarity of <span class="ital">sound</span> between the Greek words for ‘taketh away’ and ‘cleanseth,’ like ‘bear and forbear’ in English (<span class="ital">airei</span> and <span class="ital">kathairei</span>). This may be intentional, but it cannot be reproduced in translation. By cleansing is meant freeing from excrescences and useless shoots which are a drain on the branch for nothing.

The other clause, viz. <span class="greekheb">μὴ φέρον</span>, has no article, as this has, <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ καρπὸν φέρον</span>.[357]—<span class="greekheb">πλείονα</span> <span class="ital">more abundant</span>) Those excrescences which are redundant are taken away by internal and external affliction: by those very means the fruit is increased.

"Every branch in me <span class="cmt_word">that beareth no fruit</span>." Then it is possible to come into this organic relation with the true Vine, to be in it and to be a part of it, and to bring forth <span class="accented">no</span> fruit. If it were not for Ver. 5 we might say that these branches were nations, customs, institutions, and the like; but the context forbids it. The relation to him must therefore be one that is insufficient to secure life, or fruit, or continuance. Baptized, communicating, professing, partially believing Christians there may be in abundance, who, though in him, yet cannot continue in him.
