Those are self-condemned who judge others, and yet do the same thing. All who are any way called to blame the faults of others, are especially concerned to look to themselves, and keep themselves pure. In this matter Christ attended to the great work about which he came into the world, that was, to bring sinners to repentance; not to destroy, but to save. He aimed to bring, not only the accused to repentance, by showing her his mercy, but the prosecutors also, by showing them their sins; they thought to insnare him, he sought to convince and convert them. He declined to meddle with the magistrate's office. Many crimes merit far more severe punishment than they meet with; but we should not leave our own work, to take that upon ourselves to which we are not called. When Christ sent her away, it was with this caution, Go, and sin no more. Those who help to save the life of a criminal, should help to save the soul with the same caution. Those are truly happy, whom Christ does not condemn. Christ's favour to us in the forgiveness of past sins should prevail with us, Go then, and sin no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mount of Olives - The mountain about a mile directly east of Jerusalem.

"The return of the people to the inert quiet and security of their dwellings (Joh 7:53), at the close of the feast, is designedly contrasted with our Lord's homeless way, so to speak, of spending the short night, who is early in the morning on the scene again. One cannot well see why what is recorded in Lu 21:37, 38 may not even thus early have taken place; it might have been the Lord's ordinary custom from the beginning to leave the brilliant misery of the city every night, that so He might compose His sorrowful and interceding heart, and collect His energies for new labors of love; preferring for His resting-place Bethany, and the Mount of Olives, the scene thus consecrated by many preparatory prayers for His final humiliation and exaltation" [Stier].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So at our Lord’s last passover Luke notes, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/21-38.htm" title="And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.">Luke 21:38</a></span>, that <span class="ital">all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.</span> Our Saviour’s early going into the temple to teach, and the people’s diligence in coming so early to him to hear, ought to check our slothfulness in sacred business.

There is some ground for the deviation. The scenes of the previous day had been broken up into various groups. The favouring crowd from the provinces sympathized with a portion of the Jerusalem populace; then the hostile crowd at the beck of the authorities had been checked by the "officers" who had been themselves baffled and thunderstruck with the dignity and claims of Jesus. Great excitement had prevailed, and before the stormy scenes and recriminations of the previous day recommenced, the whole temple throng came unto him. If the eighth day of the feast was referred to - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if the great day of the feast were the eighth day - the difficulty of the whole people having gathered about him is diminished, because there were special gatherings for the eighth day (see notes, <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>).

He was prepared for long discourse and various instruction. Here, as in <a href="/john/7-14.htm">John 7:14</a>, the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> is used  without specifying the topic or theme on which he dwelt. The calm morning was soon overclouded, and the people violently excited, by a very ominous disturbance, planned with subtle care and malicious intention on the part of the authorities, who were ready at all costs and by any device to break the spell which Jesus was exerting over some of the people. </body></html>
