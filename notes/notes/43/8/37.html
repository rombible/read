Where the word of God has no place, no good is to be expected; room is left there for all wickedness. A sick person who turns from his physician, and will take neither remedies nor food, is past hope of recovery. The truth both heals and nourishes the hearts of those who receive it. The truth taught by philosophers has not this power and effect, but only the truth of God. Those who claim the privileges of Abraham, must do Abraham's works; must be strangers and sojourners in this world; keep up the worship of God in their families, and always walk before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I know ... - I admit that you are the descendants of Abraham.

In answer to the other part of the Jews' objection to Christ, and in favour of themselves, Christ owns that they were the natural seed of Abraham; for truth must be allowed to an adversary. But then this hindered not but they might be, as they were, in moral bondage to sin, and a generation of vipers, as those of them who came to John's baptism were; and might not be the sons of God, for not because they were the natural seed of Abraham, were they all the adopted sons of God; and might be cast out of the house of God, as Ishmael was cast out of Abraham's, though he was his natural seed. And what follows proves them to be under the power, and in the servitude of sin, and that they were the seed of the serpent that was to bruise the heel of the woman's seed, or put the Messiah to death, though they were the natural seed of Abraham: <p>but ye seek to kill me; which none but such who are under the governing power of sin, are slaves unto it, and the vassals of the devil, would ever do: the reason of which is, <p>because my word hath no place in you; their hearts were barred and bolted against it, with ignorance, enmity, and unbelief; it had no entrance into them; it did not come with power to their hearts, nor work effectually in them; it had no place at all in them, much less a dwelling; had it had one, it would have produced another effect in them, even love to Christ; which the doctrine of Christ, wherever it comes with power, and takes place in the soul, brings along with it; but where it does not, as here, hatred and indignation, envy and malice, more or less, show themselves. This clause is differently rendered, and so admits of different senses. The Vulgate Latin renders it, "my word does not take in you"; it did not take place in them, nor did it take with them; they could not receive it; in which sense the word is used in <a href="/matthew/19-11.htm">Matthew 19:11</a>; for the natural man cannot receive the doctrines of Christ; they are not suited to his taste: they are disagreeable to him. The Syriac version renders it, "ye are not sufficient for my word", to take it in; they were not capable of it; they could not understand it; it requires divine illumination, and a spiritual discerning, which they had not: the Persic version is, "ye are not worthy of my words"; of having the Gospel preached to them, and continued with them; they contradicting and blaspheming it, and rejecting the author of it; see <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>. The Ethiopic version renders it, "my word does not remain with you"; and to the same purpose the Arabic version, "my word is not firm in you"; as soon as it was heard by them, it was caught away from them by Satan, whose children they were; it made no lasting impressions on them, but was like water spilt upon the ground: it may be rendered, "my word does not enter into you"; it did not make its way and penetrate into their hearts; for though, when attended with the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power, it is quick and powerful, and sharper than a twoedged sword, and enters into the conscience, and penetrates to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and lays open the secret thoughts and intents of the heart; yet of itself is an insufficient means of conversion; it cannot make its own way; there must be an exertion of powerful and efficacious grace; which shows the hardness and obstinacy of the heart of man. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span><p>(13) Our wicked manners declare that we are obviously born of a wicked nature: but we are changed, and made part of the household of God according to the covenant which he made with Abraham by Christ alone, apprehended and laid hold on by faith: and this faith is known by a godly and honest life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/8-37.htm" title="I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.">John 8:37</a>.

This view of the meaning, which is philologically correct (Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. iii. p. 684 E; <span class="ital">Eryx</span>. p. 398 B; <span class="greekheb">ᾗ ἔμελλεν ὁ λόγος χωρήσεσθαι αὐτῷ</span>; Herod. iii. 42, v. 89; Xen. <span class="ital">Oec</span>. i. 11; Polyb. 28. 15, 12, 10. 15, 4; Aristoph. <span class="ital">Pax</span>, 472; <span class="ital">Ran</span>. 472; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/3-40.htm" title="And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out on this sort.">2Ma 3:40</a>), thoroughly applies to the persons concerned; because whilst the word of Christ had penetrated their heart and made them for the time believers (<a href="/context/john/8-30.htm" title="As he spoke these words, many believed on him....">John 8:30-31</a>), it had had no further development, it had made no <span class="ital">advance</span>; on the contrary, they had gone back again after believing for a moment. Hence, also, it is not allowable to take <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> as equivalent to <span class="ital">inter vos</span> (Lücke, Hengstenberg). <span class="ital">Others</span> interpret: <span class="ital">It finds no place in you</span> (Vulgate: non <span class="ital">capit</span> in vobis; so Origen? Chrysostom, Theophylact, Erasmus, Castalio, Beza, Aretius, Maldonatus, Corn. a Lapide, Jansen, and several others; also B. Crusius, Ewald, and Baeumlein). Without any warrant from usage.[23] <span class="ital">Others</span> again render: It finds no <span class="ital">entrance</span> into you; so that <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> would be used pregnantly, indicating the persistence that follows upon movement. So Nonnus, Grotius, Kuinoel, De Wette, Maier, Tholuck, Luthardt. The expression would have to be referred back to the meaning—<span class="ital">move forward, stretch forward</span> (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-23.htm" title="Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits.">Wis 7:23</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2 Peter 3:9</a>, and frequently in classical writers). But this explanation is neither indicated by the text (for the words are not <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑμᾶς</span>), nor is it even appropriate to the sense, seeing that the word of Christ had actually stirred those men to momentary faith. At the same time, this explanation, however, is forced on those who refuse to regard the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΠΙΣΤΕΥΚΌΤΕς</span></span></span> in <a href="/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a> as those who answer in <a href="/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[23] Aristot. <span class="ital">H.

Cyril has <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν ἐνοικήσασαν ἐν ὑμῖν ἁμαρτίαν δηλαδὴ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τόπον ὥσπερ οὐκ ἐῶσαν</span>, etc. So Euthymius and Theophylact.

The common meaning of <span class="greekheb">χωρεῖν</span>, “to advance,” is also quite relevant and indeed not materially different. It is frequently used for prosperous, successful progress.

Christ admitted the pedigree, but he proceeds to show that mere hereditary descent would be of no avail to them apart from moral considerations. These ideas, these revolutionary conceptions, so far as Judaism was concerned, were not the evolution of Christian ideas in the second century. It is most instructive to see how clearly St. Paul had already grasped them, and woven them into a powerful argument when dealing with the Judaizers in Galatia, many years before this Gospel was written (see the entire argument of <a href="/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, which thus rests on the teaching of the Christ himself). <span class="cmt_word">But ye seek to kill me.</span> This charge is certainly difficult to suppose applicable to those who "had come to believe in him" (ver. 31). One of three suppositions must be made - either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the believing Jews were surrounded by angry groups of his bitter enemies, to whom he here addressed himself;  or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the Lord spoke here to them as representing the large company of Jerusalem opponents, whom he knew at that moment to be planning his death, and as all orators and debaters are in the habit of dealing with opposing arguments by showing the character they assume in others, who make them their boast; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> those who had come to believe him up to a certain point had as rapidly relapsed, at the first touch of spiritual proof, into disbelief and cruel hostility. This seems the more natural interpretation of the fact, which may, at the same time, have become patent from some angry manifestation of his implacable foes. There is much to be found in the background and scenery of this dramatic colloquy, reported with such extreme brevity, which would, if we exactly knew how to paint it, solve its difficulties. Ye seek to slay me, <span class="cmt_word">because my word</span> - the word which is mine - <span class="cmt_word">makes no progress</span> - or, <span class="accented">advance</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in you.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> has both transitive and intransitive meanings; thus it means "leave," "depart," "turn," or "come to," with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, "contain;" <a href="/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>; <a href="/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>); but it has the force frequently in Plato "to make progress or advance," and it has this force here. So Meyer, Westcott, R.T., etc. (Luthardt and Tholuck suggest "find entrance," which would require <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>). Not only did they not <span class="accented">continue</span> in Christ's word (ver. 31), but the word itself made no way in their minds; it was barred out by prejudices, and thus choked at its very first working. Christ thus represents his word first as the very atmosphere and home in which his true disciples abide, and then as a powerful influence which grows evermore in power and command as it is pondered. It means more and more to those who abide in it; it implicitly contains a whole universe of truth and reality, of impulse and motive, for those who allow to it "free course" - who are of the truth, and hear his voice. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hath no place (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>Rev., hath not free course, or maketh no way. This rendering is in harmony with <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-30.htm">John 8:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>, concerning those who believed, but did not believe on Him, and who showed by their angry answer, in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>, that the word of Jesus had made no advance in them. The rendering of the A.V. is not supported by usage, though Field ("Otium Norvicense") cites an undoubted instance of that sense from the Epistles of Alciphron, a post-Christian writer, who relates the story of a parasite returning gorged from a banquet and applying to a physician, who administered an emetic. The parasite, describing the effect of the medicine, says that the doctor wondered where such a mess had place (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;). For the rendering of the Rev., compare Aristophanes: &#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; "How is it that the work makes no progress?"
