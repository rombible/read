The pronoun is the emphatic word: “<span class= "ital">Thou,</span> who art <span class= "ital">thou?”</span> and the phrase was in frequent use to express contempt. He had said, “I am;” but they do not understand the words to be a divine name. Long before this time the name formed from these words, and which is now usually, but wrongly, read “Jehovah,” had been regarded as too sacred to be uttered. They appear to take the sentence as though it was incomplete, “I am . . .;” “Well, who art thou?” We have again, as in <a href="/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>, to note the attempt to draw from Him some definite statement which may be made the ground of a technical charge; but this He again avoids.<p><span class= "bld">And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</span>—Almost every word of this answer is in the Greek capable of more than one meaning, and the true interpretation of the whole sentence cannot be decided with certainty. To discuss it with any fulness would be to encumber the page with details which would be unintelligible to the general reader; to discuss it with anything but fulness would be unsatisfactory to the student. There is little room for addition to the investigations which are now accessible. The full notes of Meyer and Stier and Tholuck may be read in English; and Dr. Moulton’s addition to his Translation of Winer’s <span class= "ital">Grammar</span> (eighth edition, 1877, pp. 581-2), gives in a few words nearly all that can be said on the grammatical difficulty. After a careful consideration of the whole matter, it is believed, though not without hesitation, that the rendering, which is least liable to objection on any ground, is that which regards the answer as itself a question—“What I from the beginning am also speaking to you?” “You ask who I am. This has formed the substance of My teaching from the beginning, and is the substance of My teaching still.” (Comp. <a href="/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>.) “Can it be that you ask this?”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/8-25.htm" title="Then said they to him, Who are you?

The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who art thou? - As Jesus did not expressly say in the previous verse that he was the Messiah, they professed still not to understand him. In great contempt, therefore, they asked him who he was. As if they had said, "Who art thou that undertakest to threaten us in this manner!" When we remember that they regarded him as a mere pretender from Galilee; that he was poor and without friends; and that he was persecuted by those in authority, we cannot but admire the patience with which all this was borne, and the coolness with which he answered them.<p>Even the same ... - What he had professed to them was that he was the light of the world; that he was the bread that came down from heaven; that he was sent by his Father, etc. From all this they might easily gather that he claimed to be the Messiah. He assumed no new character; he made no change in his professions; he is the same yesterday, today, and forever; and as he had once professed to be the light of the world, so, in the face of contempt, persecution, and death, he adhered to the profession.<p>The beginning - From his first discourse with them, or uniformly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

Who I am (to wit, the Messiah, <a href="/john/8-24.htm" title="I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.">John 8:24</a>; <a href="/john/8-29.htm" title="And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.">John 8:29</a>), that is the very thing which, from the very beginning, since I have been among you, and have spoken to you, has formed the matter of my discourse;[14] and can you still ask about that, as though you had not yet heard it from me?

This view is not complicated, as Winer objects, but corresponds simply to the words and to the situation. On <span class="greekheb">ἀρχήν</span> as used frequently in an adverbial sense, both among the Greeks and by the LXX., with and without the article, to denote time, <span class="ital">ab initio, from the very beginning</span>, see Schweighaüser, <span class="ital">Lex. Herod</span>. I. p. 104 f.; Lennep <span class="ital">ad Phalar</span>. p. 82 ff.

See Kühner, II. § 837, note 1; Bernhardy, p. 443; Krüger, § 51. 17. 3.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καί</span>] <span class="ital">also</span>, expresses the <span class="ital">corresponding</span> relation (Baeumlein, <span class="ital">Partik</span>. p. 152), in this case, of <span class="ital">speech</span> to <span class="ital">being:</span> what from the very beginning, as <span class="ital">I am</span> it, so also, I <span class="ital">say</span> it to you.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span>] <span class="ital">speak</span>, not: <span class="ital">say</span>.

Nor does He use <span class="greekheb">λελάληκα</span>, because it is a <span class="ital">continuous</span> speaking; the sound of it is, in fact, still ringing in their ears from. <a href="/context/john/8-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world....">John 8:23-24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage is also taken <span class="ital">interrogatively</span> by Matthaei, Lachmann, Tischendorf, and Lücke. The latter[15] renders: <span class="ital">Why, indeed, do I still speak to you at all</span>? With this view, it is true, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span> is quite compatible; for it is confessedly often used in the Classics for <span class="ital">ab initio</span>, in the sense of <span class="ital">omnino</span> (Raphel, <span class="ital">Herod. in loc.;</span> Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Viger</span>. p. 723; Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph</span>. I. p. 237; Breitenbach, <span class="ital">ad Xen. Oec</span>. ii. 12), though only in <span class="ital">negative</span> propositions, or such whose signification really amounts to a negation,[16] which latter, however, might be the case here (as in Plat. <span class="ital">Demod</span>. p. 381 D; Philo, <span class="ital">de Abr</span>. p. 366 C); it is also allowable to take <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">why</span> (see on <a href="/mark/9-11.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?">Mark 9:11</a>; Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gram</span>. p. 218 [E. T. p. 253]). But the <span class="ital">thought itself</span> has so little meaning in it, and is so little natural, expressing, besides, a <span class="ital">reflection</span>, which is at the bottom so empty, and, at the same time, through <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span>, so expanded and destitute of feeling, that we should scarcely expect it at the lips of the Johannean Jesus, especially in circumstances so lively and significant as the present. Further thus understood, the saying would have no connection whatever with what follows, and the logical connection assumed by Lücke would require the insertion of some such words as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡῚ ἘΜΟῦ</span></span></span>. The words would thus likewise stand in no relation to the question <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣῪ ΤΊς ΕἾ</span></span></span>, whereas John’s general manner would lead us to expect an answer which had reference in some significant way or other to the <span class="ital">question</span> which had been put. The following are <span class="ital">non-interrogative views</span>:—(1) “<span class="ital">What I have already said to you at the beginning, that am I!</span>” So Tholuck after Castalio, Beza, Vatablus, Maldonatus, Clericus, Heumann, and several others; also B. Crusius. Jesus would thus be announcing that He had already, from the very beginning in His discourses, made known His higher personality. The Praes. <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span>, as expressing that which still continues to be in the present, would not be opposed to this view; but it does not harmonize with the arrangement of the words; and logically, at all events, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> ought to stand before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ἈΡΧΉΝ</span></span></span> (comp. Syriac). (2) “<span class="ital">From the very first</span> (<span class="ital">before all things</span>), <span class="ital">I am what I also speak to you</span>.” So De Wette; comp. Luther (“I am your preacher; if you first believe that, you will then learn what I am, and not otherwise”), Melancthon, Aretius, and several; also Maier, who, however, takes <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν</span> incorrectly as <span class="ital">thoroughly</span> (<span class="ital">nothing else</span>).[17] On this view Jesus, instead of answering directly: “I am the Messiah,” would have said that He was to be known above all things from His discourses.[18] But <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν</span> does not mean “<span class="ital">above all things</span>,” not even in Xen. <span class="ital">Cyr.</span> i. 2, 3, where we read: <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν μὴ τοιοῦτοι</span>, <span class="ital">at the very outset not such, i.e</span>. not such <span class="ital">at all, omnino non tales;</span> just as little too in Herod. i. 9, where also, as frequently in Herodotus, it denotes <span class="ital">omnino;</span> comp. Wolf, <span class="ital">Dem</span>. <span class="ital">Lept</span>. p. 278. And how entirely without any reference would be the words <span class="ital">ante omnia</span> (surely some sort of <span class="ital">posterius</span> would need to be supplied in thought). Brückner has rightly, therefore, rejected the “<span class="ital">above all things</span>” in De Wette’s rendering, though regarding it as the only correct one, and keeping to the interpretation “<span class="ital">from the very first</span>” in its <span class="ital">temporal</span> sense. One cannot, however, see what is really intended by the words “<span class="ital">from the very first</span>, I am, etc.,” especially as placed in such an emphatic position at the commencement of the clause. For Jesus had neither occasion nor ground for giving the assurance that He <span class="ital">had been</span> from the beginning of His appearance, and still <span class="ital">was</span>, such as He had declared Himself to be in His discourses, and therefore had not since become different. (3) “<span class="ital">Undoubtedly</span> (nothing else) <span class="ital">am I what I also say to you</span>.” So Kuinoel;—a view which assigns an incorrect meaning to <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span>, and confounds <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span> with <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>; objections which affect also the similar interpretation of Ebrard: “<span class="ital">I am altogether that which I also say to you</span> (that I am He).” (4) “<span class="ital">At the very outset I declared of myself what I also explain to you,</span> or <span class="ital">what I also now say</span>.” So Starck, <span class="ital">Not. sel</span>. p. 106; Bretschneider. But the supplying of <span class="greekheb">λελάληκα</span> from the following <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span> (comp. Dissen, <span class="ital">Dem. de Cor.</span> p. 359) would only be suggested if we read <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι καὶ νῦν λαλῶ ὑμῖν</span>. (5) Fritzsche (<span class="ital">Lit. Bl. z. allg. Kirchenz</span>. 1843, p. 513, and <span class="ital">de conform. Lachmann</span>, p. 53), whom Hengstenberg follows, takes the view: “<span class="ital">Sum a rerum primordiis</span> (<a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>) <span class="ital">ea natura, quam me esse vobis etiam profiteor</span>.” Jesus would thus have designated Himself as the <span class="ital">primal Logos</span>. Quite unintelligibly for His hearers, who had no occasion for taking <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span> in the absolute sense, as though reminded of the angel of the Lord in Malachi 3 and Zechariah 11, nor for understanding <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. as Fritzsche does; at all events, as far as the latter is concerned, <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span> ought to have been used instead of <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span>. (6) Some connect <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span> with <span class="greekheb">πολλὰ ἔχω</span>, etc., <a href="/john/8-26.htm" title="I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.">John 8:26</a>, and after <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ ὑμῖν</span> place merely a comma. So already Codd., Nonnus, Scaliger, Clarius, Knatchbull, Raphel, Bengel, and, more recently, Olshausen, Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 65, II. p. 178, and Baeumlein. In taking the words thus, <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι</span> is either written <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">because</span>, with Scaliger and Raphel (so also Bengel: “<span class="ital">principio, quum etiam loquor vobis</span> [Dativus commodi: ‘<span class="ital">ut credatis et salvemini</span>’] <span class="ital">multa habeo de vobis loqui</span>, etc.”[19]), or is taken as a pronoun, <span class="ital">id quod</span>. In the latter way, Olshausen explains it, following Clarius: “<span class="ital">In the first place, as I also plainly say to you, I have much to blame and punish in you;</span> I am therefore your serious <span class="ital">admonisher</span>.” Baeumlein, however, renders: “<span class="ital">I have undoubtedly—as I also do—much to speak and to judge concerning you</span>.” But on this view of the words Jesus would have given no answer at all to the question <span class="greekheb">σὺ τίς εἶ</span>; according to Olshausen, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ἈΡΧΉΝ</span></span></span> would have to be transformed into <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">in the first place;</span> and the middle clause, according to Olshausen and Baeumlein, would give a quite superfluous sense; while, according to the view of Bengel and Hofmann, it would be forced and unnatural. (7) Exegetically impossible is the interpretation of Augustine: “<span class="ital">Principium</span> (the very beginning of all things) <span class="ital">me credite, quia</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) <span class="ital">et loquor vobis</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">quia humilis propter vos factus ad ista verba descendi;</span>” comp. Gothic, Ambrose, Bede, Ruperti, and several others. Calvin rightly rejects this interpretation, but himself gives one that is impossible. (8) Obscure, and an importation, is Luthardt’s view (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>: “<span class="ital">from the beginning am I, that I may also speak to you</span>”), that Jesus describes the act of His speaking, the existence of His word, as His presence for the Jews; that from His first appearance onwards, He who was then present as the Word of God on the earth had been always used to give Himself a presence for men in the Word. If, according to this view, as it would seem, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν ὅτι</span> denotes: “<span class="ital">from the beginning it is my manner, that</span>,” this cannot possibly be in the simple <span class="greekheb">εἰμί</span>, which has to be supplied in thought; besides, how much is forced into the mere <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΑΛῶ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[14] According to John, at His very first appearance in the temple, <a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[15] So, without doubt, Chrysostom also, who gives as the meaning: <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ὅλως ἀκούειν τῶν λόγων τῶν παρʼ ἐμοῦ ἀνάξιοί ἐστε</span>, <span class="greekheb">μήτι γε καὶ μαθεῖν ὅστις ἐγώ εἰμι</span>. Comp. Cyril and Theophylact, also Euth. Zigabenus. Matthaei explains the words in exact accordance with Lücke: “<span class="ital">Cur vero omnino vobiscum loquor? cur frustra vobiscum disputo</span>?” See <span class="ital">ed. min.</span> I. p. 575. With this also is in substantial agreement the view of Ewald, who, however, regards the words rather as the expression of righteous indignation than as a question: “<span class="ital">That I should, indeed, speak to you at all!</span>” It would be more correct to say: “<span class="ital">That I should at all even</span> (still) <span class="ital">speak to you</span>!” But how greatly is the <span class="ital">at all</span> thus in the way! “<span class="greekheb">Οτι</span>, too, would then need a supplement, which is not furnished by the text. Besides, the following words, especially if introduced without an <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> or <span class="greekheb">μέντει</span> (indicating that Jesus had collected Himself again, and suppressed His indignation), would not be appropriate. In the <span class="ital">Theol. QuartalsChr.</span> 1855, p. 592 ff., Nirschl renders: “To what purpose shall I speak further to you of the origin, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of God, and my own derivation from Him?” But on this view Christ ought, at the very least, to have said <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν μου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[16] See especially Lennep, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> and p. 94; Brückner on the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[17] Comp. Winer, p. 432 [E. T. p. 581], who gives as the meaning: “<span class="ital">I am entirely that which I represent myself as being in my discourses</span>.” So also Godet: “Absolument ce que je vous dis; ni plus ni moins que ce que renferme ma parole.” But <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρχήν</span> is used in the sense of <span class="ital">completely, entirely</span>, only in connection with negations (usually, too, <span class="ital">without</span> the article): <span class="ital">not at all, not in the least</span>; “cum negatione praefracte negando servit,” Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph. l.c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[18] </span>Under this head belongs also the view taken by Grotius (which is substantially adopted by Lange): “<span class="ital">Primum</span> (in the first instance) <span class="ital">hoc sum, quod et dico vobis</span>, hoc ipsum quod me hoc ipso tempore esse dixi, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> lux mundi.” As though we read: <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον μὲν ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι καὶ λέγω ὑμῖν</span>. In the same way as Grotius, has Calov. also explained it, taking, however, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">omnino, plane</span> (consequently like Winer).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[19] Comp. Hofmann: “At first, namely for the present, because this is the time, when He speaks to them, He has much to speak and to judge about them in words.” <span class="greekheb">Τὴν ἀρχήν</span> is alleged, to be used in opposition to a <span class="greekheb">τὸ τέλος</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to a time when that which He now <span class="ital">speaks</span> will be proved by <span class="ital">deeds</span>, ver. 28. In this way meaning and connection are imported into the passage, and yet the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (with an appeal to Hartung, <span class="ital">Partik.</span> I. p. 129) is completely neglected, or rather transferred from the relative to the principal clause. How the passages adduced by Hartung may be explained without any transference, see in Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar</span>. p. 635 ff. In particular, there is no ground for supposing the existence of a <span class="ital">trajection</span> of the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> in the N. T. Hofmann explains, as though John had written: <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι νῦν λαλῶ ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ πολλὰ ἔχω</span>, etc.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/8-25.htm" title="Then said they to him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.">John 8:25</a>. This only adds bewilderment to their mind, and they, not “pertly and contemptuously” (Meyer, Weiss, Holtzmann), but with some shade of impatience, ask: <span class="greekheb">Σὺ τίς εἶ</span>; “Who art Thou?” To this Jesus replies: <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν ὅ τι καὶ λαλῶ ὑμῖν</span>. These words are rendered in A.V[65] “Even <span class="ital">the same</span> that I said unto you from the beginning”; and in R.V[66] “Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning”. The Greek Fathers understood <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὅλως</span>, a meaning it frequently bears; and they interpret the clause as an exclamation, “That I should even speak to you at all!” [<span class="greekheb">ὅλως</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι καὶ λαλῶ ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">περιττόν ἐστιν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνάξιοι γάρ ἐστε παντὸς λόγου</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς πειρασταί</span>, Euthymius.] With this Field compares Achilles Tatius, vi. 20, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀγαπᾷς ὅτι σοι καὶ λαλῶ</span>; Art thou not content that I even condescend to speak to thee? In support of this rendering Holtzmann quotes from Clem., Hom. vi. 11, <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ παρακολουθεῖς οἷς λέγω</span>, <span class="greekheb">τί καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν διαλέγομαι</span>; He even supposes that this is an echo of John, so that we have here an indication of the earliest interpretation of the words. This meaning does no violence to the words, but it is slightly at discord with the spirit of the next clause and of Jesus generally (although <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/mark/9-19.htm" title="He answers him, and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him to me.">Mark 9:19</a>). Another rendering, advocated at great length by Raphel (<span class="ital">Annot.</span>, i. 637), puts a comma after <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν</span> and another after <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, and connects <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν</span> with <span class="greekheb">πολλὰ ἔχω</span>; “omnino, quia et loquor vobis, multa habeo de vobis loqui”. Raphel’s note is chiefly valuable for the collection of instances of the use of <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχήν</span>. A third interpretation is that suggested by the A.V[67], and which finds a remarkable analogue in Plautus, <span class="ital">Captivi</span>, III. iv. 91, “Quis igitur ille est? Quem dudum dixi a principio tibi” (Elsner). But this would require <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>, not <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span>. There remains a fourth possible interpretation, that of Melanchthon, who renders “plane illud ipsum verbum sum quod loquor vobiscum”. So Luther (see Meyer); and Winer translates “(I am) altogether that which in my words I represent myself as being”. To this Meyer and Moulton (see his note on Winer) object that <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν</span> only means “omnino” “prorsus” when the sentence is negative. Elsner, however, admitting that the use is rare, gives several examples where it is used “sine addita negativa”. The words, then, may be taken as meaning “I am nothing else than what I am saying to you: I am a Voice; my Person is my teaching”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[65] Authorised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[66] Revised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[67] Authorised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">Then said they</span>] <span class="ital">They said</span> <span class="bld">therefore</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Who art thou?</span>] It is incredible that the Jews can have failed to understand. Christ had just declared that He was from above, and not of this world. Even if the words ‘I am’ were ambiguous in themselves, in this context they are plain enough. As in <span class="ital"><a href="/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a></span>, they pretend not to understand, and contemptuously ask, <span class="ital">Thou, who art Thou?</span> The pronoun is scornfully emphatic. Comp. <a href="/acts/19-15.htm" title="And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?">Acts 19:15</a>. Possibly both in <span class="ital"><a href="/john/8-19.htm" title="Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a></span> and here they wish to draw from Him something more definite, more capable of being stated in a formal charge against Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning</span>] This is a passage of well-known difficulty, and the meaning will probably always remain uncertain. (1) It is doubtful whether it is a question or not. (2) Of the six or seven Greek words all excepting the word meaning ‘unto you’ can have more than one meaning. (3) There is a doubt whether we have six or seven Greek words. To discuss all the possible renderings would go beyond the scope of this volume. <span class="ital">What I from the beginning am also speaking to you of</span> is perhaps as likely as any translation to be right. And it matters little whether it be made interrogative or not. Either, ‘Do you ask that of which I have been speaking to you from the first?’, in which case it is not unlike Christ’s reply to Philip (<a href="/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>); or, ‘I am that of which I have been speaking to you all along.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/8-25.htm" title="Then said they to him, Who are you?

They ask the question, but in such a perverse frame of mind, that they have no real intention to believe on Him, when He tells them.—<span class="greekheb">εἶπεν</span>, <span class="ital">He said</span>) It is not said, <span class="ital">He replied</span>. The Lord addresses Himself less directly to meet the Jews’ interrogatory; but He addresses Himself to the fact itself plainly, and in such a way as to make a further progress in His own discourse. A similar question and reply occur at ch. <a href="/john/10-24.htm" title="Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long do you make us to doubt? If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.">John 10:24</a>, etc., “If Thou be the Christ, tell us <span class="ital">plainly</span>. Jesus answered—I told you, and ye believed not; the works that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness of Me.”—<span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι καὶ λαλῶ ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">πολλὰ ἔχω περὶ ὑμῶν λαλεῖν καὶ κρίνειν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὁ πέμψας με ἀληθής ἐστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ἃ ἤκουσα παρʼ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα λέγω εἰς τὸν κόσμον</span>) All these words form one complete paragraph, of which both the Protasis and the Apodosis are each double-membered, so as that they most aptly correspond with one another, in this way:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">In the beginning, since I also speak to you</span>, [inasmuch as I am even speaking to, or, <span class="ital">for</span> you],<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you</span>: <span class="ital">But He, who sent Me, is true</span>;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and what things I have heard from Him, these I speak to the world</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Every word in this passage both ought and can be taken in its own proper signification.

I have shown it to be so at Chrysost. de Sacerdot, p. 425, etc.: also at <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>.

An abbreviated form of expression, <span class="ital">i.e. These things, which were before unknown to the world, I have brought into the world, and I speak in the world, in order that they may be distributed by My witnesses throughout the whole world, now a stranger to</span> [alien from] <span class="ital">the faith, but, whether you will believe or not, hereafter about to believe. I do not pay any regard to your obstinacy</span>. Out of the four members of this portion, as marked out at the beginning of this note, the first and fourth, the second and third, cohere together in a most suitable <span class="greekheb">χιασμός</span>. In the Protasis, both the first clause, <span class="ital">I even speak to you</span>, and the second, <span class="ital">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you</span>, and the connection of both, ought to be regarded. For the words in antithesis are, <span class="ital">I even speak</span>, and the expression, <span class="ital">to you</span>: corresponding respectively to, <span class="ital">I have to speak and to judge</span>, and the expression, <span class="ital">concerning you</span>. The Apodosis is easy to perceive, when regarded by itself; but how it stands in relation to the Protasis, they who look less to the sense than to the words, are not likely forthwith to perceive. These will observe, that <span class="ital">the unbelief</span> of the Jews is marked in the Protasis; <span class="ital">but</span>, that the unshaken perseverance of Jesus in setting forth <span class="ital">the truth</span> unto salvation is <span class="ital">rather</span> made manifest in the Apodosis, and at the same time the truth itself concerning Jesus, <span class="ital">who He is</span>, is summarily brought in by implication. Comp. by all means the whole of <a href="/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>, “When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that <span class="ital">I am He</span>, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father hath taught Me, <span class="ital">I speak these things.</span>” <span class="ital">I might justly make the beginning of My speech</span>, saith He, <span class="ital">now even more than heretofore, by a judgment pronounced on your unbelief before that I bring forth the other subjects: but I perseveringly speak not so much severe things of you, as saving things of Myself</span> [tidings of salvation to you in Myself]. Very many take separately these words, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀρχὴν ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι καὶ λαλῶ ὑμῖν</span>: and indeed H. B. Starkius has thus explained the words, <span class="ital">In the beginning</span>, to wit, I said, <span class="ital">what even still I say to you</span>: which had been previously the explanation of Nic. Hemmingius, from whom John Brentius in his Homilies does not much differ. Others generally in this way: <span class="greekheb">ὃν τινα εἶναί με τὴν ἀρχὴν ἔλεγον</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰμί</span>, <span class="ital">i.e. I am He, whom in the beginning I said to you I was</span>; an interpretation which, however easy a sense it introduces, yet will be found to make many departures from the words of the text, if you compare them together.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[223] Vercellensis of the old ‘Itala,’ or Latin Version before Jerome’s, probably made in Africa, in the second century: the Gospels.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[224] Colbertinus, do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[225] Cantabrigiensis, do.: the Gospels, Acts , , 3 d Ep.

Give now a direct answer to a plain question." It is very remarkable that the Lord often refuses to respond in the precise form in which his interlocutors demand an answer. He sees the multitudinous sides of every truth, and frequently gives to his questioners the means of answering their question from the ground of deep spiritual conviction, rather than furnishes them with a formula which might easily be abused. <span class="accented">Who art thou?</span> How profoundly pathetic! How confirmatory of his own words, "Ye have not known me, nor my Father"! The reply which our Lord gave to the question has occasioned greater variety of interpretation than, perhaps, any other sentence in the Gospel: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (or <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,) <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. The meaning of the words taken separately is disputable; the relation to the context has been very variously understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence  may be taken interrogatively: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> regarded adverbially in the sense of "at all," and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the sense of "why?" which is perhaps justified by <a href="/mark/9-11.htm">Mark 9:11, 28</a>. So that it might mean, <span class="accented">Why do I even speak with you at all?</span> This is the interpretation of the ancient Greek Fathers, Cyril and Chrysostom; is preferred by Lucke ('Comm.,' 2:301-313); and with slight modifications is adopted by Ewald (who gives it more the form of an exclamation, "How is it that I should have to speak to you at all!" [this rendering is put in the margin of R.T.], Westcott and Moulton (see note to Winer, 'Grammar of New Testament,' pp. 581, 582), Matthai, and others. Meyer has differed somewhat in successive editions, but (4th edit.) translates, "What I from the beginning am also speaking to you (do ye ask)?" Can you still be asking concerning that which I have been from the beginning saying to you, viz. "Who I am"? This interpretation is singularly obscure. It turns on the fact that, except in some virtually negative sentences, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> cannot have the force of "at all," and falls back on the conclusion that it must, when used adverbially, have the force of "from the first." Lucke devotes great space to the proof from classical Greek that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> never means <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">omnino, except</span> in association with a negative sentence, and he discusses the four exceptions to this supposed rule which some grammarians have discovered in secular Greek (Lennep. 'Ap. Phalarid.,' pp. 82, 55, and 92), and thereupon, in a different way from Meyer, endeavours to supply the negative conception. In reply to Meyer, it is fair to say that Christ had not been constantly announcing in categorical terms who he was and is; and further, that the rendering practically introduces a clause, "do ye ask," which is not in the text; moreover, its rendering transforms <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Many have advocated an affirmative rendering. Augustine (with Lampe and Fritzsche) takes <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as the <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> of the universe, the <span class="accented">principium</span> (as <a href="/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>), and translates," Believe that I am the <span class="accented">Principium</span> (the Logos), because I am also speaking with you (because, humbled on your account, I have descended to such words as these)." Chrysostom and Nonnus (who turned the Gospel into Greek hexameters) associate the sentence with what follows; thus: "I, the <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, who also speak to you, have many things to say and judge of you." The accusative form is thus set at nought. Calvin takes <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> as equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the beginning" (so that the meaning would be, "I did not arise suddenly, but as I was formerly promised, so now I come forth publicly"), "<span class="accented">because I also speak with you."</span> In other words, "What I now speak is in accordance with the conditions made in all ages 'from the beginning.' So Delitzsch, Hebrew version of New Testament. Luthardt seems to approach this view, which he makes more difficult by insisting that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> does not mean "from" but "at the beginning." The view of Winer, Grimm, Alford, Stier, Godet, Thoma, and Plummer, is substantially the same, giving to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> the sense of <span class="accented">omnino. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Essentially</span>, <span class="accented">wholly, altogether</span> (<span class="cmt_word">I am</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that which even I am saying to you.</span> The grammatical objection that this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> demands a negative sentence in classic Greek, is not conclusive. This is the only place in the New Testament where the word is used adverbially, and it is in reply to a mocking question which has much virtual negative in it. Green ('Critical Notes') urges that the sense of "altogether" (<span class="accented">omnino</span>) was preserved in all kinds of sentences without distinction. He does not prove it, but it is entirely probable that it might have this force in New Testament Greek. The great advantage of the rendering is that it brings the answer into relation with the entire previous discourse, in which Christ's testimony to himself had been disputed because (in the opinion of those who were debating with him) that testimony had not been adequately supported. "I am the Revelation of the Father, the Messenger from heaven, the Bread of God, the Light of the world - essentially that which I am saying to you." Believe my own testimony thus far, and that will answer the query, "Who art thou?" There is no great distinction between this view and that of De Wette: "Von vorne herein (vor allen Dingen) bin ich was ich auch zu euch rede," as Bruckner put it - "From the beginning, from the first, (I am) what I am also saying to you." Winer's view seems to me the best. Grimm thus translates: "Omnino, hoc est sine ulla exceptione sum, quod etiam vobis eloquor, non solum sum, sed etiam vobis, praedico id quod sum." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>A very difficult passage, on which the commentators are almost hopelessly divided. There are two main classes of interpretations, according to one of which it is to be read interrogatively, and according to the other, affirmatively. The two principal representatives of the former class are Meyer, who renders "Do you ask that which all along (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;) I am even saying to you?" and Westcott, "How is it that I even speak to you at all (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)"? So also Milligan and Moulton. This latter rendering requires the change of &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;, the relative, that which, into the conjunction &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, that.<p>The second class of interpreters, who construe the passage affirmatively, vary in their explanations of &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, which they render severally, altogether, essentially, first of all, in the beginning. There is also a third class, who take &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; as a noun, and explain according to <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>, "I am the beginning, that which I am even saying unto you." This view is represented mostly by the older commentators, Augustine, Bede, Lampe, and later by Wordsworth.<p>I adopt the view of Alford, who renders essentially, explaining by generally, or traced up to its principle (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;). Shading off from this are Godet, absolutely; Winer, throughout; Thayer, wholly or precisely. I render, I am essentially that which I even speak to you. If we accept the explanation of I am, in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a>, as a declaration of Jesus' absolute divine being, that thought prepares the way for this interpretation of His answer to the question, Who art thou? His words are the revelation of Himself. "He appeals to His own testimony as the adequate expression of His nature. They have only to fathom the series of statements He has made concerning Himself, and they will find therein a complete analysis of His mission and essence" (Godet). </body></html>
