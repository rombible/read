They dishonoured Him. This to one who sought His own glory would have been matter of concern. For Him whose whole life was one of self-denial, their dishonour finds nothing which it can wound. His words repeat what He had taught them before. (See Notes on <a href="/john/5-41.htm" title="I receive not honor from men.">John 5:41</a>; <a href="/john/7-18.htm" title="He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.">John 7:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">There is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>—Comp. <a href="/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>. The thought here is that though He Himself seeks not His own glory, the Father seeketh for the honour of the Son, and judgeth between Him and those who dishonour Him. The result of the judgment as to those who keep not His word is expressed in the next verse; and as to Himself in <a href="/john/16-10.htm" title="Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;">John 16:10</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:48-53 Observe Christ's disregard of the applause of men. those who are dead to the praises of men can bear their contempt. God will seek the honour of all who do not seek their own. In these verses we have the doctrine of the everlasting happiness of believers. We have the character of a believer; he is one that keeps the sayings of the Lord Jesus. And the privilege of a believer; he shall by no means see death for ever. Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it also, yet they shall shortly be where it will be no more forever, Ex 14:13.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mine own glory - My own praise or honor. In all his teaching this was true. He did not seek to exalt or to vindicate himself. He was willing to lie under reproach and to be despised. He regarded little, therefore, their taunts and accusations; and even now, he says, he would not seek to vindicate himself.<p>There is one that seeketh and judgeth - God will take care of my reputation. He seeks my welfare and honor, and I may commit my cause into his hands without attempting my own vindication. From these verses <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46-50</a> we may learn:<p>1. That where men have no sound arguments, they attempt to overwhelm their adversaries by calling odious and reproachful names. Accusations of heresy and schism, and the use of reproachful terms, are commonly proof that men are not only under the influence of unchristian feeling, but that they have no sound reasons to support their cause.<p>2. It is right to vindicate ourselves from such charges, but it should not be done by rendering railing for railing. "In meekness we should instruct those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth," <a href="/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>.<p>3. We should not regard it as necessarily dishonorable if we lie under reproach. If we have a good conscience, if we have examined for ourselves, if we are conscious that we are seeking the glory of God, we should be willing, as Jesus was, to bear reproach, believing that God will in due time avenge us, and bring forth our righteousness as the light, and our judgment as the noonday, <a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>50. I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh&#8212;that is, evidently, "that seeketh My glory"; requiring "all men to honor the Son even as they honor the Father"; judicially treating him "who honoreth not the Son as honoring not the Father that hath sent Him" (Joh 5:23; and compare Mt 17:5); but giving to Him (Joh 6:37) such as will yet cast their crowns before His throne, in whom He "shall see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied" (Isa 53:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ very often reminds them of this, that in what he spake and did, he sought not his own honour and reputation; which both obviated an objection they might make against him, and also convinced them of his truth and sincerity in what he did. But, saith he, though I seek not my own honour, yet there is one who cometh himself in my honour and glory; and you must expect that he should judge and condemn you for all your hard speeches which you have spoken against me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I seek not mine own glory,.... In his doctrine, or in his miracles; which showed that he was no impostor, but a true, faithful, and upright person; and though he was so very much reproached and abused, he was not over solicitous of his own character, and of retrieving his honour, and of securing glory from man; he knew that Wisdom was justified of her children, and he committed himself to God that judgeth righteously, who would take care of his glory, and vindicate him from all the unjust charges and insults of men: <p>there is one that seeketh and judgeth; meaning God his Father, who had his glory at heart; who had glorified him on the mount, and would glorify him again, when he should raise him from the dead, and spread his Gospel in all the world; and when he would judge the nation of the Jews, and bring wrath upon them, upon their nation, city and temple, for their contempt and rejection of him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> that seeketh and judgeth.</span><p>(q) That is, that will avenge both your despising of me and of him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/8-50.htm" title="And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeks and judges....">John 8:50-51</a>. <span class="ital">I, however</span>, in contrast to this unrighteousness by which you wound my honour, <span class="ital">seek not the honour which belongs to me</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔστιν ὁ ζητ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κρίνων</span>, <span class="ital">there is one</span> (comp. <a href="/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>) <span class="ital">who seeks it</span> (“qui me honore afficere velit,” Grotius), <span class="ital">and pronounces judgment</span>, that is, <span class="ital">as a matter of fact</span>, between me and my revilers.
