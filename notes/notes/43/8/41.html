It seems that they perceived, at length, that Jesus spake not so much of natural as of spiritual lineage; and that they alluded to the marriage-covenant, which, in Scripture, is said to have subsisted between God and the Jewish nation, and by which their obligation to reverence, love, and obey him, was represented as fidelity to their heavenly husband, and their violation of that obligation, as spiritual whoredom. <span class="ital">Jesus said, If God were your Father </span>— And you were his genuine children, as you profess to be; <span class="ital">you would love me </span>— And therefore would be far from forming designs to take away my life; <span class="ital">for I proceeded forth and came from God </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εξηλθον και ηκω</span>, <span class="ital">I proceeded, </span>namely, originally, <span class="ital">and do come from God, </span>and appear among you as his messenger. <span class="ital">Neither came I of myself — </span>As the false prophets did, who had neither their mission nor message from God; <span class="ital">but he sent me </span>— As is evident from the many proofs of my mission, which I am daily giving you.

We are here in a state of probation: and God is trying, so to speak, how we will conduct ourselves toward him; and we shall be treated accordingly in a state of retribution. God has taken various methods to prove mankind, and this was one: he sent his Son into the world with sufficient proofs both of his Sonship and mission, concluding that all, who called him Father, would kiss his Son, and bid <span class="ital">him </span>welcome, who was <span class="ital">firstborn among many brethren. </span>By this our adoption will be proved or disproved, namely, by our loving, or not loving Christ. <span class="ital">Why do ye not understand my speech </span>— What is the reason that you do not comprehend the true meaning of the things which I have spoken to you? <span class="ital">Even because</span> — Or, interrogatively, <span class="ital">Is it not because ye cannot hear my word </span>— Cannot give obedience thereto, it being contrary to your lusts?

Hence, they said, We are not thus descended. We have the evidence of our genealogy. We are worshippers of the true God, descended from those who acknowledged him, and we acknowledge no other God and Father than him. To be children of fornication is an expression denoting in the Scriptures idolatry, or the worship of other gods than the true God, <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-3.htm">Isaiah 57:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>.

In this case, however, they would be bastards, born of fornication (the fornication of Sarah with another man); and they would have two fathers, an actual one (from whom they descend <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πορνείας</span>) and a putative one (Abraham). But inasmuch as their descent is not an adulterous one,[25] and notwithstanding that Abraham is not to be regarded as their father, there remains in opposition to the assertion of Jesus, so they think, only <span class="ital">God</span> as the one Father; to Him, therefore, they assign this position: “<span class="ital">We be not born of fornication</span>,” as thou seemest to assume, in that thou refusest to allow that Abraham is our father; <span class="ital">one father only</span> (not two, as is the case with such as are born of adultery) <span class="ital">have we</span>, and that <span class="ital">God</span>, if our descent from Abraham is not to be taken into consideration. For God was not merely the creator (<a href="/malachi/2-10.htm" title="Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?">Malachi 2:10</a>) and <span class="ital">theocratic</span> Father of the people (<a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm" title="Doubtless you are our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: you, O LORD, are our father, our redeemer; your name is from everlasting.">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm" title="But now, O LORD, you are our father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.">Isaiah 64:8</a>); but His Fatherhood was further and specially grounded in the power of His promise made at the conception of Isaac (<a href="/romans/4-19.htm" title="And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:">Romans 4:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-23.htm" title="But he who was of the female slave was born after the flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise.">Galatians 4:23</a>). The supposition that they implicitly drew a contrast between themselves and <span class="ital">Ishmael</span> (Euth. Zigabenus, who thinks that there is an allusion to the birth of Jesus, Ruperti, Wetstein, Tittmann) is erroneous, inasmuch as Ishmael was not born <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πορνείας</span>. We must reject also the common explanation of the passage as a denial of the charge of <span class="ital">idolatry</span> (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm" title="The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitutions and children of prostitutions: for the land has committed great prostitution, departing from the LORD.">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-4.htm" title="And I will not have mercy on her children; for they be the children of prostitutions.">Hosea 2:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-30.htm" title="Why say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit you prostitution after their abominations?">Ezekiel 20:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-3.htm" title="But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.">Isaiah 57:3</a>); “our filial relationship to God has not been polluted by idolatry” (De Wette; comp. Grotius, Lampe, Kuinoel, Lücke, Tholuck, Lange, Hengstenberg, Baeumlein, and several others). It is quite opposed to the context, however, for the starting-point is not the idea of a superhuman Father, nor are the Jews reproached at all with idolatry; but the charge is brought against them, that Abraham is not their father; hence also the supposition of an antithesis to a combined Jewish <span class="ital">and heathen</span> descent (Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theophylact, Godet), such as was the case with the <span class="ital">Samaritans</span> (Paulus), is inadmissible. Ewald also takes the same simple and correct view;[26] comp. Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>. Bengel, however, aptly characterizes the entire objection raised by the Jews as a “novus importunitatis Judaicae paroxysmus.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>] spoken with the emphasis of pride.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[25] <span class="greekheb">Ἐκ πορνείας</span> implies one mother, but several fathers. Who is the one mother, follows from the denial of the paternity of <span class="ital">Abraham</span>, consequently <span class="ital">Sarah</span>, the ancestress of the theocratic people. Hence the inadmissibility of Luthardt’s explanation based on the idea, “Israel is Jehovah’s spouse;” according to which the thought of the Jews would have been: they were not sprung from a marriage covenant of Israel with another, so that Jehovah would thus be merely nominally their father, in reality, however, another; and they would thus have several fathers. Moreover, a <span class="ital">marriage</span> covenant between Israel and another would be a contradiction, this other must needs also be conceived as a true <span class="ital">God</span>, consequently as a <span class="ital">strange</span> God, a notion which Luthardt justly rejects. It is surprising how B. Crusius could adduce <a href="/deuteronomy/23-2.htm" title="A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:2</a> for the purpose of representing the Jews as affirming their theocratic equality of birth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] Although characterized by Ebrard as <span class="ital">absurd</span>. He regards <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πορνείας οὐ γεγ</span>. as merely a “<span class="ital">caricatured form</span>” of the accusation that they are not Abraham’s children, and in this way, of course, gets rid of the need of <span class="ital">explaining</span> the words. He then takes <span class="greekheb">ἕνα πατέρα ἔχομεν</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">we and thou have one common Father</span>, which is incompatible with the word <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>, which also belongs to <span class="greekheb">ἔχομεν</span>, and is, besides, altogether opposed to the context; for the entire dialogue is constituted by the <span class="ital">antithesis</span> of <span class="ital">we</span> and thou, <span class="ital">I</span> and <span class="ital">ye.</span> Ebrard’s view is an unfortunate evasion of a <span class="ital">desperate</span> kind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/8-41.htm" title="You do the deeds of your father.

The following are the chief explanations: (1) Thou hast denied that we are the children of Abraham, then we must be the children of some one sinning with Sarah: which is false.’ But this would be adultery, not fornication. (2) ‘We are the children of Sarah, not of Hagar.’ But this was lawful concubinage, not fornication. (3) ‘We are not a mongrel race, like the Samaritans; we are pure Jews.’ This is far-fetched, and does not suit the context. (4) ‘We <span class="bld">were</span> not born of fornication, <span class="ital">as Thou art</span>.’ But His miraculous birth was not yet commonly known, and this foul Jewish lie, perpetuated from the second century onwards (Origen, <span class="ital">c.

If thou art speaking of spiritual parentage, ‘we have one Father, even God.’ This last seems the best. Idolatry is so constantly spoken of as whoredom and fornication throughout the whole of the O.T., that in a discussion about spiritual fatherhood this image would be perfectly natural in the mouth of a Jew. <a href="/context/exodus/34-15.htm" title="Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and one call you, and you eat of his sacrifice;...">Exodus 34:15-16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm" title="And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to devils, after whom they have gone a whoring.

Abrupt and startling was the retort: <span class="cmt_word">We are</span> [were] <span class="cmt_word">not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.</span> Many expositors think  that these Jews began to babble against the possibility of their being bastard children of Sarah, or to protest that they were not Ishmaelites or any collateral branch of the seed of Abraham, like the Idumaeans or the sons of Keturah. This is far away from the context, and unworthy of the controversy. The idea is sufficiently explained by the second clause. The covenant relation between Jehovah and Israel is so constantly referred to in the Old Testament (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>) under the image of marriage and the unfaithfulness of particular generations to Jehovah; and their false worship and idolatry are so often regarded as "fornication" and "adultery" from God, the Husband of the dedicated spouse, so that nothing is more probable, when Jesus charged them with doing the works of their father, that they should have exclaimed, "Surely we have no idolatrous sympathies. None but Jehovah is our God. Thou must not charge us with any compromise with the accursed thing." The wild rage which the Jews had shown to Pilate in the matter of the shields, their abhorrence of the defilement of idols in the matter of food, their avoidance even of the supreme court of Roman justice under fear of idolatrous contamination, explain the outflash of this indignant rejoinder. This view is, in the main, advocated by De Wette, Lampe, Lucke, Lange, and Hengstenberg; but opposed by Meyer, Westcott: "We do not owe our position to idolatrous desertion of Jehovah. We are the offspring of the union of God with his chosen people. Our spiritual descent is as pure as our historical descent." Godet modifies it: "We have no idolatrous <span class="accented">blood</span> in our veins; we are Hebrews of the Hebrews." They claim to be the children of God, as well as children of Abraham (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye do<p>Or, are doing.<p>Fornication (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;, to sell. </body></html>
