The pronoun is emphatic. “Even if <span class= "ital">I</span> do bear witness of Myself, yet My witness is true.” He had before quoted their law of evidence (<a href="/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31</a>), and showed that He fulfilled its canons. He is about to show this again (<a href="/context/john/8-17.htm" title="It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.">John 8:17-18</a>), but He claims first that in reality the law cannot apply to Him. They claim a human proof of that which transcends human knowledge. They claim the evidence of a witness, to a truth for which there could not possibly be a human witness.<p><span class= "bld">For I know whence I came, and whither I go.</span>—The requirement of two witnesses was based on the imperfection of individual knowledge, and the untrustworthiness of individual veracity. His evidence, as that of One who knew every circumstance affecting that of which He testified, was valid, for the perfection of His knowledge implied that He was divine. He and He only of all who have appeared in human form, knew the origin and issue of His life; He and He only knew the Father’s home from which He came, and to which He was about to return. For the same words, “I go,” or, <span class= "ital">I go away,</span> as applied to His voluntary death, comp. <a href="/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33</a>.<p><span class= "bld">But ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span>—The Greek word for “cannot tell” is the same as that for “know” in the previous clause. For “and” most of the better MSS. read <span class= "ital">or.</span> Making these corrections we have, <span class= "ital">But ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.</span> The change of tense is to be noted. Speaking of His own knowledge, He refers to the Incarnation in the historic past, “I came.” Speaking of their continued ignorance, He refers to the coming as continuing in the present. Every renewed act and word was a coming to them from God. (See <a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>.) He knew, in the fulness of knowledge, the whence of past coming and the whither of future going. They knew neither the one nor the other. They do not even know His present mission. Once again His present teaching takes up words uttered before. They had said, “When the Christ cometh no man knoweth whence He is” (<a href="/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>). He has, then, fulfilled their test. He had said, “Ye both know Me, and do know whence I am” (<a href="/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>); but that knowledge was of the earthly life only, and He now speaks to them of heaven.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:12-16 Christ is the Light of the world. God is light, and Christ is the image of the invisible God. One sun enlightens the whole world; so does one Christ, and there needs no more. What a dark dungeon would the world be without the sun! So would it be without Jesus, by whom light came into the world. Those who follow Christ shall not walk in darkness.

Though, in common life, in courts, and in mere human transactions, it was true that a man ought not to give evidence in his own case, yet in this instance, such was the nature of the case that his word was worthy to be believed.<p>My record - My evidence, my testimony.<p>Is true - Is worthy to be believed.<p>For I know whence I came ...but ye ... - I know by what authority I act; I know by whom I am sent, and what commands were given me; but you cannot determine this, for you do not know these unless I bear witness of them to you. We are to remember that Jesus came not of himself <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; that he came not to do his own will, but the will of his Father. He came as a witness of those things which he had seen and known <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>, and no man could judge of those things for no man had seen them. As he came from heaven; as he knew his Father's will; as he had seen the eternal world, and known the counsels of his Father, so his testimony was worthy of confidence. As they had not seen and known these things, they were not qualified to judge. An ambassador from a foreign court knows the will and purposes of the sovereign who sent him, and is competent to bear witness of it. The court to which he is sent has no way of judging but by his testimony, and he is therefore competent to testify in the case. All that can be demanded is that he give his credentials that he is appointed, and this Jesus had done both by the nature of his doctrine and his miracles. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. for I know whence I came, and whither I go, &c.&#8212;(See on [1805]Joh 7:28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is a seeming difficulty to reconcile the words of our Saviour, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31</a></span>, <span class="ital">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true, </span> and his assertion here, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Though I bear record of myself, my record is true:</span> but the resolution of it is clear by considering that he speaks in the former chapter of his own single testimony with respect to them, as not of sufficient validity to authorize his Divine vocation, according to the rule of their law, that required a double testimony for confirmation of things; but here he speaks of the verity of it in itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For I know whence I came, and whither I go; </span> that is, I know from whom I have received my commission, (though secret to the world), even from the Father: and yet, after the accomplishing of my embassy for his honour, I shall return to heaven, and be glorified with the glory I had with him before the world was, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a></span>.

The difference between <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰ</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἰ καί</span> is clearly stated by Hermann on Viger, 822; Klotz on Devarius, 519; and is for the most part observed in N.T.

He knows His origin and His destiny. He knows Himself, and therefore the rule mentioned has no application to Him.—<span class="greekheb">πόθεν ἦλθον</span> cannot of course be restricted to His earthly origin.

He alone knew the nature of His mission, yet it behoves to be known by all men; therefore He must declare Himself.
