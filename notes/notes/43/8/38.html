The clauses are in direct opposition to each other, and this is shown by the emphatic personal pronouns—“I, on My part . . . My Father.” “You, on your part . . . your father.” The tenses of the verbs, too, are to be distinguished—“That which I have seen” (during My whole existence in eternity). “That which ye heard” (when ye became servants of sin).

It is not simply “and ye do,” but “and ye therefore, or accordingly, do.” It is the same principle of union between Father and Son which directs His work, which is to reveal God, and their work, of which the seeking to kill Him is an instance.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:37-40 Our Lord opposed the proud and vain confidence of these Jews, showing that their descent from Abraham could not profit those of a contrary spirit to him. Where the word of God has no place, no good is to be expected; room is left there for all wickedness. A sick person who turns from his physician, and will take neither remedies nor food, is past hope of recovery. The truth both heals and nourishes the hearts of those who receive it. The truth taught by philosophers has not this power and effect, but only the truth of God. Those who claim the privileges of Abraham, must do Abraham's works; must be strangers and sojourners in this world; keep up the worship of God in their families, and always walk before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I speak ... - <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11-13</a>.<p>My Father - God.<p>Your father - The devil.

The ‘therefore’ (rare in discourses) is severely ironical. The connexion of <span class="ital"><a href="/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a></span> with <span class="ital"><a href="/john/8-37.htm" title="I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.">John 8:37</a></span> is not quite obvious. Perhaps it is this:—My words make no progress in you, because they are so different in origin and nature from your acts, especially your attempt to kill Me.

He describes himself in constant communion with the Father. The Father is with him. He knows the mind and will and good pleasure of the Father. His is the perfectly pure heart, which is as an eye forevermore beholding the Father. That the Only Begotten sees and knows what no other sees, is constantly taught in this Gospel (see <a href="/john/3-32.htm">John 3:32</a>; <a href="/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>). In Christ, moreover, the disciple may verily see the Father (<a href="/john/14-7.htm">John 14:7, 9</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-23.htm">1 John 2:23</a>). The probable textual reading given above would draw a species of contrast between Christ's "seeing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) with the Father, and the Jews' "hearing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) from the Father, as though such communication were less intimate than "seeing." This must not be pressed (see ver. 40). If the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> be imperative, the language would be an appeal to the Jews to act out that which, from prophets and teachers and interpreters of the Divine will, they had heard. Moulton treats the clause as one more, one last, exhortation. The word of Christ had not advanced within them - it remained as a barren formula; let them give it free course now. Their opposition had not as yet been malignant or hopeless; one more chance is given them. The more ordinary interpretation is to make the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> indicative. If it be so, and still more if the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (omitted by B, L, P) be genuine, "the father" to whom reference is made as theirs, is in contrast with the Father of Christ, and, without pointedly saying so, Jesus implies that it is another father altogether. In ver. 44 Christ does indeed declare that the father with whom they are in ethical relation and sympathy is not God, but the devil - the very opposite of the God of Abraham, the very antithesis of the Father of infinite love. At this point   he simply suggests, "Therefore the things which ye heard from your father ye do," ye habitually do, ye are now doing in your hatred and murderous sentiments towards myself. Surely this implies a severity which is hardly compatible with an address to Jews who believed him. The interpretation of the following verse is governed by that of this. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye have seen<p>The best texts read &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, ye heard. </body></html>
