These words seem to arise from their judgment of Him as expressed in their scornful question, “Who art thou?” He has, indeed, immediately before (<a href="/john/8-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.">John 8:23</a>), spoken of them. He is about in this discourse to do so again. There are present to His mind now many things to say of them, and these, if said, would be in words of condemnation; but He refrains. There is present to His mind also the great work He had to do—to speak to the world the eternal truth of God.<p><span class= "bld">But he that sent me is true.</span>—The words express a marked contrast to the words and thoughts with which He would come in contact, if He said and judged concerning them. They refer to the calm repose of the divine life in heaven, as contrasted with the misunderstandings and objections with which the manifestation of that life on earth had been encompassed. He turns from them to the thought of Him who sent Him, and who is true.<p><span class= "bld">And I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">I speak unto the world the things which I heard from Him.</span> It is the truth brought into and announced in the world, and which was heard during the pre-incarnate life with the Father.

The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have many things to say - There are many things which I might say to reprove and expose your pride and hypocrisy.

The meaning of this verse may be thus expressed: "I have indeed many things to say blaming or condemning you. I have already said many such things, and there are many more that I might say; but I speak only those things which God has commanded. I speak not of myself I come to execute his commission, and he is worthy to be heard and feared. Let it not be thought, therefore, that my judgment is rash or harsh.

Being God omniscient, he knew their persons and actions, their lives and conversations, and all their sins and transgressions, which he could justly have complained of, and charged them with, and proved against them, and judged and condemned them for; but this was not his present business, he came not to judge and condemn, but to save: wherefore he waved these things, and took no notice of them, leaving them to his Father, who would call them to an account, and punish them for them: <p>but he that sent me is true; as to his promises concerning the mission of his Son, to be the Saviour of sinners; so to his threatenings, to bring down vengeance on those that disbelieve him, and reject him: <p>and I speak to the world, or "in the world", <p>those things which I have heard of him; as concerning his love, grace, and mercy to those that should believe in him, so of the destruction of the despisers and rejecters of him; which things he spoke not in secret, in a corner, but publicly and openly, before all the world, to Jews and Gentiles, and to as many as were in the treasury, in the temple at this time; see <a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span><p>(10) God is the avenger of Christ's despised doctrine.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/8-26.htm" title="I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.">John 8:26</a>.

The paraphrase: “I have very much to speak concerning you, and especially to blame; but I refrain therefrom, and restrict myself to my immediate task, which is to utter forth to the world <span class="ital">that</span> which I have heard from God the True, who has sent me (namely, what I heard during my existence with God, before my mission; comp. on <a href="/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>[20])—in other words, to the communication of divine truth to the world.” For divergent views of the course of thought, see Schott, <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. I. p. 94 ff. After the example of older writers, Lücke and De Wette take the view that Jesus meant to say: “But, however much I have to judge concerning you, my <span class="greekheb">κρίσις</span> is still <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΗΘΉς</span>;<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> for I speak to the world only what I have heard from my Father, who is true.” Comp. also Tholuck. In this way, however, the antithesis has to be <span class="ital">artificially formed</span>, whilst the <span class="ital">expressed</span> antithesis between that which Jesus <span class="ital">has</span> to speak (<span class="greekheb">ἔχω λαλεῖν</span>) and that which He actually <span class="ital">says</span> (<span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>) is neglected. This is in answer to Ewald also, who imports into <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛ</span></span>’ the meaning: “Yet I will not therefore be afraid, like a man;” and against Hengstenberg, who, after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΛΛᾺ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΚΡΊΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, supplies in thought: “This is the reason why you will not accept my utterances in relation to my person.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚἈΓΏ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">and I, for my part</span>, in contrast to God; the word is connected with <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑῦΤΑ</span></span></span>] this and nothing else.
