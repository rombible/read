and also that with “He that heareth my word,” in <a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>. This last passage is the key to the words before us. Here, as there, the thought of judgment and death leads to the opposite thought of coming not into judgment, but passing out of death into life. Here, as there, the believer is thought of as possessing the true spiritual life which cannot see death, but shall pass into the fuller spiritual life hereafter.<p>Another interpretation of the phrase rendered “He shall never see death,” is “he shall not see death for ever”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> “he shall indeed die, but that death shall only be in this world, it shall not be in the world which is for ever.” This is the thought in the collect in “The Order for the Burial of the Dead “<span class= "ital">. . . </span>“our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and whosoever liveth and believeth in him shall not die eternally.”<p>The following are the only passages in St. John where exactly the same formula is used, and a comparison of them will make it clear that it means, as does the Hebrew formula on which it is based, that which we express by “never,” or “certainly never.” “by no means ever,” for the negative is in its strongest form (<a href="/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>, <a href="/john/8-52.htm" title="Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that you have a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.">John 8:52</a> in this <a href="/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a>; <a href="/john/11-26.htm" title="And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.

The first and last of these passages refer to subjects (“shall never thirst,” “shall never wash my feet”), which do not admit any possibility of doubt. The others are all parallel to the present text, in thought as well as in word. In all there is the fuller meaning that for the believer who now has spiritual life, and continues to live in communion with God, there cannot be death. “He shall never see death.” What we think of as death is but a sleep. (See Note on <a href="/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>.) Death has been swallowed up of life, and physical death is thought of, in its true sense, as an entering into life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:48-53 Observe Christ's disregard of the applause of men. those who are dead to the praises of men can bear their contempt. God will seek the honour of all who do not seek their own. In these verses we have the doctrine of the everlasting happiness of believers. We have the character of a believer; he is one that keeps the sayings of the Lord Jesus. And the privilege of a believer; he shall by no means see death for ever. Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it also, yet they shall shortly be where it will be no more forever, Ex 14:13.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If a man keep my saying - If he believes on me and obeys my commandments.<p>He shall never see death - To see death, or to taste of death, is the same as to die, <a href="/luke/2-26.htm">Luke 2:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a>; <a href="/mark/9-1.htm">Mark 9:1</a>.

If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death&#8212;Partly thus vindicating His lofty claims as Lord of the kingdom of life everlasting, and, at the same time, holding out even to His revilers the scepter of grace. The word "keep" is in harmony with Joh 8:31, "If ye continue in My word," expressing the permanency, as a living and paramount principle, of that faith to which He referred: "never see death," though virtually uttered before (Joh 5:24; 6:40, 47, 51), is the strongest and most naked statement of a very glorious truth yet given. (In Joh 11:26 it is repeated in nearly identical terms).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To <span class="bld">see death, </span> in this text, signifieth to die, but in an apparently differing sense from what it is taken in <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/2-26.htm" title="And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.">Luke 2:26</a></span>, where it is to be understood of a natural death; of which it cannot be understood here, for the holiest men shall die: <span class="ital">the body is dead</span> (that is, in dying) <span class="ital">because of sin; </span> or, shall die because of sin, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a></span>. It must therefore be understood of death eternal; and in that sense the proposition is certainly true, That a holy man that keepeth the sayings of Christ shall not see death, that is, shall have eternal life; which is no more than what we have often before met with, viz. the promise of life eternal to faith and holiness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Verily, verily, I say unto you,....

It is impossible that the Jews should have listened unmoved to Christ's rejoinder on their rude taunt, or been unimpressed by the self-composed and lofty way in which the honour of our Lord was calmly entrusted by him to the Father. The Jews may say what they please, call him by any opprobrious name they choose; "there is One that seeketh" his glory, and he is content. He has, in earlier portions of this discourse, promised freedom and sonship to those who abide in his word; and now to those who believed on him he says, with extraordinary emphasis, <span class="cmt_word">If a man</span> (any one) <span class="cmt_word">have kept my word, he shall never behold death.</span> This "keeping" is more than "abiding" in the word. There is the additional notion of intently watching the "keeping," which issues in "fulfilling" and "obeying" (Meyer and Tholuck); see ver. 55; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15, 21, 23</a>; <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>; <a href="/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6</a>.

He will never know what death is (cf. here; <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>; <a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>, where the Saviour speaks of the "living water," and "life eternal," and "living bread," which whoso partaketh shall never die.. See also <a href="/john/11-26.htm">John 11:26</a>). He does not tell his disciples that they shall not see the grave, but that in the deepest sense they shall never die. "Death" and "life" are words that are lifted into a higher connotation. Death is a moral state, not an event in their physical existence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Keep (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>See on <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>.<p>Saying (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, word, as Rev.

The double negative signifies in nowise, by no means. &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; see, denoting steady, protracted vision, is purposely used, because the promise contemplates the entire course of the believer's life in Christ. It is not, shall not die forever, but shall live eternally. Upon this life, which is essentially the negation and contradiction of death, the believer enters from the moment of his union with Christ, and moves along its entire course, in time no less than in eternity, seeing only life, and with his back turned on death. The reverse of this truth, in connection with the same verb, is painfully suggestive. The question is pertinent why the Revisers have retained see, and have not substituted behold, as in so many instances. </body></html>
