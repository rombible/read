God will seek the honour of all who do not seek their own. In these verses we have the doctrine of the everlasting happiness of believers. We have the character of a believer; he is one that keeps the sayings of the Lord Jesus. And the privilege of a believer; he shall by no means see death for ever. Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it also, yet they shall shortly be where it will be no more forever, Ex 14:13.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom makest thou thyself? - Or, who dost thou pretend to be? Although the greatest of the prophets have died, yet thou a Nazarene, a Samaritan, and a devil pretendest that thou canst keep thy followers from dying! It would have been scarcely possible to ask a question implying more contempt and scorn. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>52, 53.

What dost thou make thyself? And by the way, this was another charge upon our Saviour, the Jews having no patience with any that should prefer himself before their father Abraham or Moses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Art thou greater than our father Abraham?.... So the woman of Samaria said, concerning Jacob, <a href="/john/4-12.htm">John 4:12</a>. The Jews had a mighty opinion of their ancestors, especially of Abraham; and yet they allow the Messiah to be greater than he, as Jesus truly was: so one of their ancient commentators (w) on those words of <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a> thus paraphrases them, <p>""Behold my servant shall deal prudently", this is the King Messiah; "he shall be exalted" above Abraham, as it is written, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>, "and extolled" above Moses, as it is written, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>, and he shall be higher than the ministering angels, as it is written, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, for he shall be  , "greater than the fathers".'' <p>They add here, of Abraham, <p>which is dead; he was a great and good man, and yet dead: <p>and the prophets are dead; though they truly kept, and faithfully delivered the word of God: <p>whom makest thou thyself? who art a poor carpenter's son, a Galilean, a Nazarene, and yet makest thyself greater than Abraham, or any of the prophets; yea, makest thyself to be God, to promise security from death, and an everlasting continuance of life upon keeping thy word. <p>(w) Tachuma apud Huls. p. 321. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/8-53.htm" title="Are you greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom make you yourself?">John 8:53</a>.

This claim to be Giver of immunity from death, and the further assumption that the belief of and continuance in his word would metamorphose and transfigure death itself, implied functions which "made" Jesus mightier, more august, than either Moses or Elijah, Abraham or the  prophets, who were dead.
