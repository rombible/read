The same carnal prejudices still prevail in the minds of the Jews, and prevent their reception of Christ; they laying it down as a first principle, that he is to be a great temporal prince and deliverer. And the admission of false principles, which are constantly taken for granted, and never examined, will, it is to be feared, be attended with fatal consequences to thousands more. <span class="ital">I judge no man </span>— Not thus; not now; not at my first coming.

The rejection of His testimony by the Pharisees in <a href="/john/8-13.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.">John 8:13</a>, was an act of <span class="ital">judgment</span> on their part which, inasmuch as they were unacquainted with His higher position as an ambassador of God, had been determined merely by <span class="ital">His cutward sensuous appearance</span>, by His servant’s form (<span class="greekheb">εἰσορόωντες ἐμὴν βροτοειδέα μορφήν</span>, Nonnus), as to which He seemed to them to be an ordinary man. This Jesus tells them, and adds, how very differently He proceeds in this respect.[10] <span class="greekheb">Κρίνειν</span> receives through the context the <span class="ital">condemnatory</span> sense, and <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν σάρκα</span> is not to be understood of the <span class="ital">subjective</span> norm (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ ἀνθρωπίνης διανοίας</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀδίκως</span>; De Wette: in a carnal, selfish manner; comp.

There is no need, however, for supplying in thought <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span>, as even Augustine proposed, and after Cyril’s example many modern writers (also Kuinoel, Paulus); to the same thing comes Lücke’s supplement: <span class="ital">as you do</span>. This is decidedly to be rejected, partly for the general reason that the proper <span class="ital">point</span> would have to be supplied in thought, and partly because, in <a href="/john/8-16.htm" title="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.">John 8:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐὰν κρίνω</span> cannot be taken otherwise than absolutely, and <span class="ital">without</span> supplement. For these reasons <span class="ital">every</span> kind of supplement must be rejected, whether by the insertion of <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, which would point to the future judgment (Augustine, Chrysostom, Euth.

Luther aptly remarks: “He herewith clothes Himself with His <span class="ital">office</span>;” but an antithesis to <span class="ital">teaching</span> (Calvin, Beza) is foreign to the verse; and the interpretation: I have no <span class="ital">pleasure</span> in judging (De Wette), imports into the words what they do not contain.[11]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/john/8-16.htm" title="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.">John 8:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐὰν κρίνω δὲ ἐγώ</span>] <span class="greekheb">καὶ δέ</span> here and in <a href="/john/8-17.htm" title="It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.">John 8:17</a>, <span class="ital">atque etiam</span>, see on <a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a>.

Comp.

So if the incarnate Word had always been judged "after the flesh," we should never have seen his glory, nor recognized the  nobler part of his Personality. <span class="cmt_word">I judge no man</span>. Numerous efforts have been made to find the underlying modification of this assertion. Augustine, Chrysostom, Cyril, and many moderns add, "after the flesh," or "as you do" (the latter is the suggestion of Lucke, which, as Meyer says, comes to the same thing), or "now," pointing on to the actual assumption of his judiciary powers at the consummation of all things, and contrasting his earthly ministry of mercy with the ultimate majesty of his judgment throne (Westcott). Storr, Moulton, Godet. suggest "I by myself" - I alone, independently of the Father, judge no man. Meyer rejects all these attempts to add to the text, and maintains that our Lord is claiming the lofty position of Saviour rather than Judge. He came with that as his primary aim, purpose, intent; to heal, not to wound; to save, not to destroy; to give time for repentance, not to hurry sinners to their doom; to illumine, not to cover with darkness. Yet even Meyer admits a practical exception of great importance to be involved in the next clause, which does not differ from Westcott's interpretation. </body></html>
