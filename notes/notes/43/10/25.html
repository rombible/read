Their misconception of the Messianic work had made the very word Messiah an impossible one for Him to utter to them. To have said He was the Messiah would have been to sanction their thought of Him as a temporal prince; to have said that He was not would have been to contradict the essential truth. He refers them, then, to His earlier words and deeds in proof of what He was. To inquirers of simpler hearts, as the woman of Samaria and the man born blind, He had used the word Messiah.

Christ would make us to believe; we make ourselves doubt. The Jews understood his meaning, but could not form his words into a full charge against him. He described the gracious disposition and happy state of his sheep; they heard and believed his word, followed him as his faithful disciples, and none of them should perish; for the Son and the Father were one. Thus he was able to defend his sheep against all their enemies, which proves that he claimed Divine power and perfection equally with the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I told you - It is not recorded that Jesus had told them in so many words that he was the Christ, but he had used expressions designed to convey the same truth, and which many of them understood as claiming to be the Messiah.

It is true, indeed, that He had not given <span class="ital">direct</span> expression to the words <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὐκ ἐστὲ</span>, etc. in the preceding allegory; <span class="ital">indirectly</span>, however, He had done so, namely, by a description of His sheep, which necessarily involved the <span class="ital">denial</span> that the <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖοι</span> belonged to them. That this is the force of <span class="greekheb">καθʼ εἶπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>., He Himself declares by the exhibition of the relation of His sheep that follows. We are precluded from regarding it as an introduction to <span class="ital">what follows</span> (Curss., Cant., Corb., Arr., Euth. Zigabenus, Tholuck, Godet), in which case a comma ought to be placed before <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>, and a colon after <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, by the circumstance that Jesus nowhere else quotes and (in the form of a summary) <span class="ital">repeats</span> a longer discourse of His own. In keeping with the style of the Gospels, only a brief, sententious saying, such as <a href="/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>, would be fitted for such self-quotation. In this case, however, the quotation would embrace at least <a href="/context/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:...">John 10:27-28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The circumstance that Jesus should refer to this allegory about two months after the date of <a href="/context/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber....">John 10:1-21</a>, which has been erroneously used as an argument against the originality of the discourse (Strauss, Baur), may be simply accounted for by the assumption that during the interval He had had no further discussions with His hierarchical opponents,—a supposition which is justified by its accounting for the silence observed by John relatively to that period. The presupposition involved in the words <span class="greekheb">καθὼς εἶπον ὑμῖν</span>, that Jesus here has in the main the same persons before Him as during the delivery of His discourse regarding the shepherd, has nothing against it; and there is no necessity even for the assumption that John and Jesus conceived the discourses to be directed against the <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖοι</span> as a <span class="ital">whole</span> (Brückner).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/10-25.htm" title="Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.">John 10:25</a>.
