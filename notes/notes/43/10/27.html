One member of each pair refers to the act or state of the sheep; and the other to the act or gift of the Shepherd. The pairs proceed in a climax from the first response of the conscience which recognises the divine voice to the eternal home which is in the Father’s presence.<p>(1)“My sheep hear My voice,” . . “and I know them;”<p>(2)“And they follow Me”<span class= "ital"> .</span> . “and I give unto them eternal life;”<p>(3)“And they shall never perish” . . . “neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.”<p>By reading successively the clauses placed on the left side of the page, we trace the progress of the human act and state; by reading, in the same way, the clauses on the right side of the page, we trace the progress of the divine gift; by reading each pair in the order of the text, we see how at each stage the gift is proportioned to the faculty which can receive it.<p>The earlier clauses are familiar to us from the preceding discourse, but some expressions will need a word of explanation.<p><span class= "bld">Eternal life.</span>—Comp. <a href="/john/10-10.htm" title="The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.">John 10:10</a>, where the word “eternal” is added in some readings.

The words should not be limited by the insertion of the word man. They are to be taken as including every spiritual foe; all thieves and robbers that would break into the fold; all wolves that would rend the flock; the adversary who “as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour.” (Comp. especially for the full thought of no separation from Christ, <a href="/context/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38-39</a>.) The words “out of my hand” express alike the strength which protects, and guidance which leads, and comfort which cherishes. (See <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>.) Out of this hand none shall pluck. Yet we are to bear in mind that the sheep itself may wander from the shepherd’s care, and that all the fulness of these promises depends upon the human will, which is included in the first clause, “My sheep hear my voice . . . and they follow me.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/john/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:...">John 10:27-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">My sheep hear my voice, </span>&c. — Our Lord still alludes to the discourse he had had before this festival.

Never did any prophet before, from the beginning of the world, use any one expression of himself which could possibly be so interpreted, as this and other expressions were, by all that heard our Lord speak.

He described the gracious disposition and happy state of his sheep; they heard and believed his word, followed him as his faithful disciples, and none of them should perish; for the Son and the Father were one. Thus he was able to defend his sheep against all their enemies, which proves that he claimed Divine power and perfection equally with the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My sheep - My church, my people, those who have the true spirit of my followers.
