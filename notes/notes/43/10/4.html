We should read, therefore, <span class= "ital">when he has put forth all his own sheep.</span> The addition is important as marking the care of the shepherd to count his flock and see that none is missing. The word “put forth” is stronger than “lead out,” in the previous verse, and represents the details of the action as it took place in the sheepfold. The shepherd would call each sheep by name, and when it answered to its name would drag it outside the fold. Though it knew its shepherd, it would be unwilling to separate itself from the whole flock. One by one, then, he calls his sheep, and places them outside the fold.<p><span class= "bld">He goeth before them, and the sheep follow him.</span>—This is one of the incidents in the management of an Eastern flock, which strikes all who see it for the first time, and is abundantly illustrated in books of Eastern travel.

Men, as creatures depending on their Creator, are called the sheep of his pasture. The church of God in the world is as a sheep-fold, exposed to deceivers and persecutors. The great Shepherd of the sheep knows all that are his, guards them by his providence, guides them by his Spirit and word, and goes before them, as the Eastern shepherds went before their sheep, to set them in the way of his steps. Ministers must serve the sheep in their spiritual concerns. The Spirit of Christ will set before them an open door. The sheep of Christ will observe their Shepherd, and be cautious and shy of strangers, who would draw them from faith in him to fancies about him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He putteth forth - Or leads them out of the fold.<p>He goeth before them - He leads them, and guides them, and does not leave them. A shepherd spent his time with his flocks. He went before them to seek the best pastures and watering-places, and to defend them from danger. In this is beautifully represented the tender care of him who watches for souls as one that must give account. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

In other countries, as France, &c., it is otherwise at this day; the shepherds go before their flocks, and their flocks follow them, upon some sounds they make. In Palestine (which was the Jews country) it should seem that the shepherds sometimes went before their sheep, and sometimes followed them. David followed his father’s sheep, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm" title="Now therefore so shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:">2 Samuel 7:8</a> <a href="/psalms/78-71.htm" title="From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.">Psalm 78:71</a></span>.

The Ethiopic version reads, "when he leads them all out"; in order to bring them into proper pastures: <p>he goeth before them; in allusion to the eastern shepherds, who when they put out their flocks, did not, as ours do, drive them before them, and follow after them, at least not always, but went before them: so Christ, the great shepherd, goes before his flock, not only to provide for them, but by way of example to them; in many instances he is an ensample to the flock, as under shepherds, according to the measure of grace received, should be: he has left them an example in many respects, that they should tread in his steps: <p>and the sheep follow him; in the exercise of the graces of humility, love, patience, self-denial, and resignation of will to the will of God; and in the discharge of duty, walking, in some measure, as he walked. <p>For they know his voice; in the Gospel, which directs and encourages them to exercise grace in him, and to walk in the path of duty: this they know by the majesty and authority of it; and by the power with which it comes to their souls; and by its speaking of him, and leading to him; and by the evenness, harmony, and consistency of it. The Persic version renders the whole thus; "when he calls and leads out the sheep, they go before him, and their lambs after them, for they know his voice". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/10-4.htm" title="And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.">John 10:4</a>. <span class="ital">And when he has brought out all his own sheep</span> (those belonging to <span class="ital">his</span> flock), and so forth.

Most of the best MSS. have ‘all’ for ‘sheep:’ ‘there shall not an hoof be left behind’ (<a href="/exodus/10-26.htm" title="Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.">Exodus 10:26</a>). The word for ‘put forth’ is remarkable; it is the same as is used in <a href="/context/john/9-34.htm" title="They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out....">John 9:34-35</a> of the Pharisees ‘casting out’ the man born blind. This is perhaps not accidental: the false shepherds put forth sheep to rid themselves of trouble; the true shepherds put forth sheep to feed them. But even the true shepherds must sometimes use a certain amount of violence to their sheep to ‘compel them to come’ (<a href="/luke/14-23.htm" title="And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.">Luke 14:23</a>) to the pastures. But note that there are no ‘goats’ in the allegory: all the flock are faithful. It is the ideal Church composed entirely of the elect. The object of the allegory being to set forth the relations of Christ to His sheep, the possibility of bad sheep is not taken into account. That side of the picture is treated in the parables of the Lost Sheep, and of the Sheep and the Goats.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/10-4.htm" title="And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.">John 10:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐκβάλη</span>, <span class="ital">He putteth forth</span>) Synonymous with the verb, <span class="greekheb">ἐξάγει</span>, <span class="ital">He leadeth out</span>, but more general.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In like manner, our Lord continues to describe what every true shepherd of men has done and ever will do: <span class="cmt_word">When he hath put forth all</span> <span class="cmt_word">his own</span>, and not another's, drawn them by the music of his voice, or constrained them by the sweet violence of his love, or even compelled them to go forth from a fold in which they may find security, but not pasture; and when he has marshaled them into obedience and into thankful trust by the strength of his sympathy and knowledge of their need, <span class="cmt_word">he goeth before them.</span> He is their leader and example; he shows them in his own life the kind of provision made for them; he shares with them the perils of the wilderness, and first of all is prepared to grapple with their fierce foes, "He drinks of the brook in the way." The highest meaning, the only complete interpretation, of this passage is found when Christ himself is the Shepherd, who does summon from the old enclosure "all his own," all who have entered into living harmony with himself. <span class="cmt_word">And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</span> Nothing is here said of "lost sheep" or of "goats;" these are all the "ideal sheep" of the flock, individuals who recognize the voice of the true Leader, and discriminate their own shepherd from all others, whether pretenders to their affections or destroyers of their lives  - wolves or butchers, thieves or robbers. Should we persist in interpreting the apologue as it stands, a question arises about the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> that are not the shepherd's" own." Some have answered it by supposing that the latter are the chief of his own flock, who will bring the rest after them. The truth is not obscurely hinted of that election to highest privileges and duties, which does not declare that the rest are not sheep at all. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Putteth forth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Rev., more strictly, hath put forth. Instead of leadeth out, in <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>. It implies a constraint; as if some of the sheep were unwilling to leave the fold. Meyer says that putteth forth pictures the manner of the leading out. He lays hold on the sheep and brings them out to the door.<p>His own sheep (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>The best texts read &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, all, for &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, sheep: all his own.

The shepherd calls from time to time to remind them of his presence. They know his voice and follow on; but if a stranger call, they stop, lift up their heads in alarm, and if the call is repeated, they turn and flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers. This is not the fanciful costume of a parable; it is simple fact. I have made the experiment often" (Thomson). </body></html>
