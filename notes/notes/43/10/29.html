Note on <a href="/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>. Here our version has rightly made no limiting addition to “all” (comp. last verse). In the width of the word, which extends to every creature and to every power, and even to the Son in His subordination to the Father, the Father is thought of as greater than all. Again the thought mounts with each succeeding sentence: (1) “None shall pluck them out of My hand;” (2) “They are My Father’s gifts, and He is greater than all;” (3) “None shall pluck them out of My Father’s hand.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:22-30 All who have any thing to say to Christ, may find him in the temple. Christ would make us to believe; we make ourselves doubt. The Jews understood his meaning, but could not form his words into a full charge against him. He described the gracious disposition and happy state of his sheep; they heard and believed his word, followed him as his faithful disciples, and none of them should perish; for the Son and the Father were one. Thus he was able to defend his sheep against all their enemies, which proves that he claimed Divine power and perfection equally with the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which gave them me - See <a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>.<p>Is greater - Is more powerful.<p>Than all - Than all others - men, angels, devils.

It implies, further, that God will keep them, and will so control all other beings and things that they shall be safe.<p>None is able - None has power to do it. In these two verses we are taught the following important truths:<p>1. that Christians are given by God the Father to Christ.<p>2. that Jesus gives to them eternal life, or procures by his death and intercession, and imparts to them by his Spirit, that religion which shall result in eternal life.<p>3. that both the Father and the Son are pledged to keep them so that they shall never fall away and perish. It would be impossible for any language to teach more explicitly that the saints will persevere.<p>4. that there is no power in man or devils to defeat the purpose of the Redeemer to save his people. We also see our safety, if we truly, humbly, cordially, and daily commit ourselves to God the Saviour. In no other way can we have evidence that we are his people than by such a persevering resignation of ourselves to him, to obey his law, and to follow him through evil report or good report. If we do that we are safe. If we do not that we have no evidence of piety, and are not, cannot be safe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

It is a general expression of an admitted truth, and what follows shows for what purpose it was uttered, "and none is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand." The impossibility of true believers being lost, in the midst of all the temptations which they may encounter, does not consist in their fidelity and decision, but is founded upon the power of God. Here the doctrine of predestination is presented in its sublime and sacred aspect; there is a predestination of the holy, which is taught from one end of the Scriptures to the other; not, indeed, of such a nature that an "irresistible grace" compels the opposing will of man (of course not), but so that that will of man which receives and loves the commands of God is produced only by God's grace (Olshausen&#8212;a testimony all the more valuable, being given in spite of Lutheran prejudice).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> All that are my sheep became so by my Father’s donation and gift, so as my Father is equally with myself concerned in the preservation of them to that happy end, to which he hath ordained and designed them.

But this continued <span class="ital">divine</span> protection is really nothing else than the protection of <span class="ital">Christ</span>, so far, that is, as the Father is in the Son and works in Him (see <a href="/context/john/10-37.htm" title="If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not....">John 10:37-38</a>); hence the latter, as the organ and vehicle of the divine activity in carrying out the Messianic work, is not separated from God, is not a second some one outside and alongside of God; but, by the very nature of the fellowship referred to, <span class="ital">one with God</span> (compare Weiss, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 205 f.).

The unity, therefore, is one of <span class="ital">dynamic</span> fellowship, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. a unity of action for the realization of the divine decree of redemption; according to which, the Father is in the Son, and moves in Him, so that the Father acts in the things which are done by the Son, and yet is greater than the Son (<a href="/john/14-28.htm" title="You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you.

The <span class="ital">Arian</span> idea of <span class="ital">ethical agreement</span> is insufficient; the reasoning would miss its mark unless unity of <span class="ital">power</span> be understood (on which Chrysostom, Euth.

The <span class="ital">orthodox</span> interpretation, which makes it denote <span class="ital">unity of essence</span> (Nonnus: <span class="greekheb">ἓν γένος ἐσμεν</span>; Augustine: <span class="ital">unum</span>, delivers us from Charybdis, that is, from Arius, and <span class="ital">sumus</span> from Scylla, that is, from Sabellius), specially defended by Hengstenberg, though rejected even by Calvin as a misuse of the passage, goes beyond the argumentation; at the same time, in view of the metaphysical character of the relation of the Son to the Father, clearly taught elsewhere, and especially in John, the Homoousia, as the essential foundation, must be regarded as presupposed in the fellowship here denoted by <span class="greekheb">ἕν ἐσμεν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/10-29.htm" title="My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.">John 10:29</a>. These strong assertions He bases, as always, on the Father’s will and power. <span class="greekheb">ὁ πατήρ μου</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐσμεν</span>. “My Father who has given me these sheep is greater than all: and therefore no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. But this is equivalent to my saying no one can snatch them out of my hand, for I and the Father are one.”—<span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ Πατὴρ ἕν ἐσμεν</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/context/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me....">John 17:21-23</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πάντες ἓν ὦσι</span>. Bengel says: “<span class="ital">Unum</span>, non solum voluntatis consensu, sed unitate potentiae, adeoque naturae. Nam omnipotentia est attributum naturale; et serino est de unitate Patris et Filii. In his verbis Jesu plus viderunt caeci Judaei, quam hodie vident Antitrinitarii.” But Calvin is right when he denies that the words carry this sense: “Abusi sunt hoc loco veteres ut probarent Christum esse Patri <span class="greekheb">ὁμοούσιον</span>. Neque enim Christus de unitate substantiae disputat, sed de consensu quem cum Patre habet: quicquid scilicet geritur a Christo Patris virtute confirmatum iri.” An ambassador whose demands were contested might quite naturally say: “I and my sovereign are one”; not meaning thereby to claim royal dignity, but only to assert that what he did his sovereign did, that his signature carried his sovereign’s guarantee, and that his pledges would be fulfilled by all the resources of his sovereign. So here, as God’s representative, Jesus introduces the Father’s power as the final guarantee, and claims that in this respect He and the Father are one. Whether this does not involve metaphysical unity is another question. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Tertullian, <span class="ital">adv. Praxeam</span>, 22; Hippolytus, <span class="ital">c.

Meyer, however, translates this differently; he supposes the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to refer to the Father "a something greater, a greater potence." Westcott and Hort prefer the reading with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; and Westcott translates, <span class="accented">That which my Father has given me is greater than all</span>, and regards it as a reference to the sheep as a collective unity. The internal reasons compel Luthardt, Godet, and Lange to fall back on T.R., and surely the extraordinary strain of the meaning justifies them. Our Lord would sustain with even stronger assurance the safety of his sheep. The Father's gift to himself, the Father's own eternal love and power, the Divine omnipotence of the Lord God himself, is pledged to their security. "My hand" becomes "my Father's hand." He seems to say, "If you question my capacity, you need not question his power. Sacrilegious violence may apparently nail my hands to the cross; the sword may awake against Jehovah's Shepherd. But none can outwit, surprise, crucify, conquer, my Father, none can invalidate his care." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>There is considerable confusion here about the reading.
