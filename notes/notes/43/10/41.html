In contrast with the rejection at Jerusalem there is the reception on the old ground, which brings memories of early days and bright hopes, which are not without their fulfilment now. The mission of the Seventy, and Christ’s own work in Galilee before the Feast of the Dedication (comp.

This was not said to Him, but was a general remark suggested by the associations of the spot. The remark assigns to John the position as a witness which he claimed for himself, and which the Evangelist has made prominent in the narrative of His work. He did no sign, and therefore came short of the glory of Him whose signs they had seen and heard of; but more than any other he had recognised that glory, and directed men to it. His spiritual intuition, in advance of the generation in which he lived, was itself a sign, and all things which he had said about the Messiah had, in the events which had taken place since they had seen Him in that place before, been proved to be true. The witness of the past is linked to that of the present. The enthusiasm which John had kindled still burns.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:39-42 No weapon formed against our Lord Jesus shall prosper. He escaped, not because he was afraid to suffer, but because his hour was not come. And He who knew how to deliver himself, knows how to deliver the godly our of their temptations, and to make a way for them to escape. Persecutors may drive Christ and his gospel our of their own city or country, but they cannot drive him or it out of the world.

Either miracle or prophecy is conclusive proof of a divine mission, for no man can foretell a future event, or work a miracle, except by the special aid of God. It may be remarked that the people of that place were properly prepared by the ministry of John for the preaching of Jesus. The persecution of the Jews was the occasion of his going there, and thus the wrath of man was made to praise him. It has commonly happened that the opposition of the wicked has resulted in the increased success of the cause which they have persecuted. God takes the wise in their own craftiness, and brings glory to himself and salvation to sinners out of the pride, and passions, and rage of wicked men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. many resorted to him&#8212;on whom the ministry of the Baptist had left permanent impressions.<p>John did no miracle, but all things John spake of this man were true&#8212;what they now heard and saw in Jesus only confirming in their minds the divinity of His forerunner's mission, though unaccompanied by any of His Master's miracles. And thus, "many believed on Him there."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God so ordered it in the wisdom of his providence, that though Elijah and Elisha under the law wrought miracles, by which they confirmed their Divine mission; yet John, coming immediately before Christ, as his messenger and forerunner, wrought none; that so the glory of Christ in working miracles when he came might be more clear and evident. This made the people, that came to Christ while he was in Galilee, say thus amongst themselves, We paid a great veneration to John the Baptist, yet he never did those things which Christ hath done: and whatsoever John told us of this person hath proved true; he hath done, and doth, greater things than ever John did, and is in the judgment of sense to be preferred before him, should we not now believe in him? John told us he was <span class="ital">the Lamb of God, who takes</span> <span class="ital">away the sins of the world; </span> and told us much more concerning him, which our eyes see is true. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And many resorted to him,.... From all the parts adjacent, having heard of his being there, and of the fame of him; and many of them doubtless personally knew him; these came to him, some very likely to be healed by him, others to see his person and miracles, and others to hear him preach: <p>and said, John did no miracle; though it was now three years ago, yet the name, ministry, and baptism of John, were fresh in the memory of men in those parts; and what they say one to another, was not to lessen the character of John, but to exalt Jesus Christ, and to give a reason why they should receive and embrace him; for if John, who did no miracle, who only taught and baptized, and directed men to the Messiah, was justly reckoned a very great person, and his doctrine was received, and his baptism was submitted to, then much more should this illustrious person be attended to; who, besides his divine doctrine, did such great and amazing miracles; to which they add, though John did no miracle to confirm his mission, ministry, and baptism, <p>but all things that John spake of this man, were true; as that he was greater than he, was the Lamb of God, yea, the Son of God, the Saviour of the world, and true Messiah, who should baptize men with the Holy Ghost and with fire. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/10-41.htm" title="And many resorted to him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.">John 10:41</a>. There He was still busy; for <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτόν</span>, “many came to Him and said,” that is, giving this as their reason for coming, that “although John himself had done no miracle, all he had said of Jesus was found to be true”. The reference to John is evidently suggested by the locality, and probably means that the “many” alluded to as coming to Jesus belonged to the district and had been impressed by John. The correspondence between what they had heard from the Baptist and what they saw in Jesus, as well as the intrinsic evidence of the works He did, engendered belief in Him (<a href="/john/10-42.htm" title="And many believed on him there.">John 10:42</a>) <span class="greekheb">Καὶ ἐπίστευσαν πολλοὶ ἐκεῖ εἰς αὐτόν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">41</span>. <span class="ital">many resorted unto him</span>] There is no reason why the usual translation ‘came’ should be changed to ‘resorted.’ The testimony of the Baptist, and perhaps the miraculous voice at Christ’s Baptism, were still remembered there. Since then there had been the mission of the Seventy and Christ’s own work in Galilee.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and said</span>] Or, <span class="bld">kept saying</span> or <span class="ital">used to say:</span> it was a common remark.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">John did no miracle</span>] Or <span class="bld">sign</span>. This is indirect evidence of the genuineness of the miracles recorded of Christ. It is urged that if Jesus had wrought no miracles, they would very possibly have been attributed to Him after His death. Let us grant this; and at the same time it must be granted that the same holds good to a very great extent of the Baptist. The enthusiasm which he awakened, as a Prophet appearing after a weary interval of four centuries, was immense. Miracles would have been eagerly believed of him, the second Elijah, and would be likely enough to be attributed to him. But more than half a century after his death we have one of his own disciples <span class="ital">quite incidentally</span> telling us that ‘John did <span class="ital">no</span> miracle’; and there is no rival tradition to the contrary. <span class="ital">All</span> traditions concur in attributing miracles to Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/10-41.htm" title="And many resorted to him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.">John 10:41</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μέν</span>, <span class="ital">indeed</span>) The antithesis is between <span class="ital">John</span> and <span class="ital">this Man</span>, Jesus: not between the works and sayings of John.—<span class="greekheb">περὶ τούτου</span>, <span class="ital">concerning this Man</span>) concerning this Man, who doeth so many <span class="ital">miracles</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀληθῆ ἦν</span>) <span class="ital">were true</span>.

It was not John's function to work miracles or startle the world with visible proofs of his Divine commission. John stood on the natural sphere, found a place in contemporaneous history, and exerted all his influence by the force of his prophetic word. But as a remarkable confirmation of the whole revelation enacted by the life and deeds of Christ, we read, <span class="cmt_word">But all things that John spake of this Man were true.</span> The testimonies of John were to the effect that Jesus was "mightier" than he - that he was the Son of God, the "Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and with fire," and "<span class="accented">the</span> Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world." The absence of the miraculous nimbus from the record of John's ministry is one of the subsidiary evidences we possess of the supernatural power wielded by our Lord Jesus Christ. John was a historic contemporary of Jesus, whose following survived for some centuries, but not until comparatively recent times did credulity or the mythopceic tendency clothe him in a supernatural glory. He was believed to be the Elijah of the new covenant, but he was not supposed to have gone to heaven, like his prototype. A rumor grew up that Jesus was John raised from the dead, but nothing came of it. There was all the material for a splendid myth, but no evolution of one. The reasoning, therefore, is fair - since Jesus <span class="accented">is</span> reported by <span class="accented">John's disciples</span> to have wrought great signs; these reports are not to be put down to credulity or fiction. The evangelist distinctly asserts that all these testimonies which he had himself recorded in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>, when followed up by the visible and wonderful presence of the Son of God himself, were held to be true. We need not wonder, then, that <span class="cmt_word">many believed on him there.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
