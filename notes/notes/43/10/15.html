But connecting the words with those of the previous verse, we have, “I am the Good Shepherd, and know <span class= "ital">those who are Mine, and those who are Mine know Me, even as the Father knoweth Me, and I know the Father.”</span> This deeper sense of union between the human spirit and Himself, and the wondrous likening of it to the union of Himself and the Father, is present to His mind as the close of His work on earth draws near.

It is bound up with the thought of the love which lays down His own life for them. This is repeated here and again in <a href="/context/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17-18</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the Father knoweth me ... - See the <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a> note; also <a href="/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a> note.<p>I lay down my life for the sheep - That is, I give my life as an atoning sacrifice for their sins.

As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father&#8212;What claim to absolute equality with the Father could exceed this? (See on [1819]Mt 11:27).<p>and I lay down my life for the sheep&#8212;How sublime this, immediately following the lofty claim of the preceding clause! It is the riches and the poverty of "the Word made flesh"&#8212;one glorious Person reaching at once up to the Throne and down even to the dust of death, "that we might live through Him." A candid interpretation of the words, "for the sheep," ought to go far to establish the special relation of the vicarious death of Christ to the Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By these words our Saviour openeth how he knew his sheep, and should be again known of them, even as the Father knoweth him, and he knows his Father: this mutual knowledge between the Father and Christ was joined with perfect love and delight. Thus our Saviour knoweth those that are his sheep, not only fully and distinctly, so as to call them all by their names; but so as to love them, delight in them; so as to be ready to lay down his life for their good, and eternal salvation. Christ, to show not only the sincerity, but the degrees, of his love to his people, doth often compare it to the love wherewith his Father loved him, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/15-9.htm" title="As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you in my love.">John 15:9</a> 17:23,26</span>. So that if we can believe that God the Father loved Christ his only begotten Son, we may also believe that both the Father and Christ love those that are truly the sheep of Christ. The love that Christ hath to his people is as true and as certain as the Father’s love to Christ, or Christ’s love to his Father; and this could be showed by no higher act than that of laying down his life, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a></span>. Now, saith he, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I lay down, </span> that is, I am ready to lay down, or I shall shortly lay down, <span class="bld">my life for the sheep:</span> whether <span class="ital">sheep</span> can signify all and every person born into the world, is their concern more strictly to inquire, who are so tenacious of that point. That Christ died equally for all and every man: as also, whether upon that principle that absurdity must not follow. That Christ loved those who shall yet perish eternally, with such a love as the Father loved him, and he loved the Father. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As the Father knoweth me,.... These words, with what follow, are in connection with <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>; and the sense is, that the mutual knowledge of Christ, and his sheep, is like that which his Father and he have of each other. The Father knows Christ as his own Son, and loves him as such, in the most strong and affectionate manner; and has entrusted him with the persons, grace, and glory, of all his people: <p>even so know I the Father; or rather, "and I know the Father"; as he needs must, since he lay in his bosom, and still does, and knows his nature, perfections, purposes, and his whole mind and will; and loves him most ardently, which he has shown by his coming down from heaven, to do his will; and trusts in him for the accomplishment of everything he promised unto him: <p>and I lay down my life for the sheep; which proves him to be the good shepherd, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "for my sheep"; which were his, by the Father's gift, and for no other has he laid down his life. The Ethiopic version, as before, renders it, or rather explains it, "I lay down my life for the redemption of my sheep". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As the Father <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span><p>(e) Loves me, allows me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/10-15.htm" title="As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.">John 10:15</a>. This reciprocal knowledge is so sure and profound that it can only be compared to the mutual knowledge of the Father and the Son: <span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span> … <span class="greekheb">πατέρα</span>. He then applies to Himself what had been stated in general of all good shepherds in <a href="/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>; and <a href="/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a> might suitably have begun with the words “And my life I lay down for the sheep”. This statement is, however, prompted by His reference to His knowledge of the Father. He knows it is the Father’s will that He should lay down His life. See <a href="/context/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again....">John 10:17-18</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/john/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">As the Father knoweth me, even so</span>, &c.] This rendering entirely obscures the true meaning. There should be no full stop at the end of <span class="ital"><a href="/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a></span>, and the sentence should run; <span class="bld">I know Mine, and Mine know Me, even as the Father knoweth Me and I know the Father</span>. So intimate is the relation between the Good Shepherd and His sheep that it may be compared to the relation between the Father and the Son. The same thought runs through the discourses in the latter half of the Gospel: <a href="/john/14-20.htm" title="At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.">John 14:20</a>, <a href="/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>, <a href="/john/17-8.htm" title="For I have given to them the words which you gave me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from you, and they have believed that you did send me.">John 17:8</a>; <a href="/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>; <a href="/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>; <a href="/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.">John 17:21</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/10-15.htm" title="As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.">John 10:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθώς</span>, <span class="ital">as</span>) This is connected with the preceding verse.
