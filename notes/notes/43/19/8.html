He must have heard of some of the current impressions as to His life and words; he had himself heard Him claim a kingdom which is not of this world; his wife’s dream (<a href="/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>) had furnished an evil omen which the superstition of the most educated classes of the Roman empire would interpret as a message from the gods; and now the Jews speak of Him as one who claimed to be the Son of God.

For doubtless he had heard of some of the many miracles which Jesus had performed, and now, it seems, began to think that perhaps what had been currently reported was true, and that he really had performed the wonderful works ascribed to him. For it is very well known, that the religion which the governor professed directed him to acknowledge the existence of demi-gods and heroes, or men descended from the gods. Nay, the heathen believed that their gods themselves sometimes appeared on earth, in the form of men, <a href="/context/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men....">Acts 14:11-12</a>. Pilate, therefore, <span class="ital">went again into the judgment-hall — </span>Being resolved to act cautiously; <span class="ital">and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? </span>— That is, From whom art thou descended? or what is this divine original which thou art charged with claiming? <span class="ital">But Jesus</span> — Knowing that his innocence was already apparent, even to the conviction of Pilate’s conscience; <span class="ital">gave him no answer </span>— To that question. Indeed, Pilate’s ordering, or allowing such cruelties to be inflicted on a person he knew to be innocent, rendered him unworthy of an answer. <span class="ital">Then saith Pilate </span>— Marvelling at his silence, and being displeased with it; <span class="ital">Speakest thou not unto me? </span>— Dost thou make me no reply, and not so much as speak to me in such a circumstance as this, in which thy life is so evidently concerned? <span class="ital">Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee</span> — To adjudge thee to that terrible death; <span class="ital">and have power to release thee</span> — If I please, notwithstanding all the clamourous demands of thine enemies? <span class="ital">Jesus answered — </span>With great calmness and mildness; <span class="ital">Thou couldest have no power at all against me </span>— For I have done nothing to expose myself to the power of any magistrate; <span class="ital">except it were given thee </span>— In an extraordinary way; <span class="ital">from above </span>— From the God of heaven, whose providence I acknowledge in all these events. Some have thought that the word <span class="greekheb">ανωθεν</span>, <span class="ital">from above, </span>refers to the situation of the temple, which stood much higher than the pretorium: and that it is as if Jesus had said, I know that whatever thou dost against me, is only in consequence of the sentence passed in yonder court held above, so that their guilt is greater than thine. But though this would very well account for the connection of the latter part of this verse, “I cannot think,” says Dr. Doddridge, “it altogether just; for had Providence permitted Pilate to seize Christ as one dangerous to Cesar’s dignity, he would have had as much power of putting him to death as he now had. It is therefore much more reasonable to suppose it refers to the permission of God’s providence.” <span class="ital">Therefore he that delivered me unto thee </span>— Namely, the Jewish high-priest, with his council, having far greater opportunities of being acquainted with God and his law than thou hast, and knowing, also, that I have done nothing amiss; <span class="ital">hath the greater sin </span>— Is more blameable than thou art. <span class="ital">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him </span>— That is, he was still further satisfied of the injustice of the prosecution, and of the innocence of Jesus, so that he endeavoured even more than before to have him released. For the reader will observe, that this was not the first attempt of Pilate to release Jesus. This evangelist himself tells us, (<a href="/john/18-39.htm" title="But you have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?">John 18:39</a>,) that he had once before offered to release him. And the answer of the priests on this occasion corresponds thereto. They <span class="ital">cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar’s friend </span>— That is, thou art not faithful to the emperor; by which they insinuated that they would accuse him to his master, if he did not do his duty. This argument was weighty, and shook Pilate’s resolution to the foundation. He was frightened at the very thought of being accused to Tiberius, who in matters of government, as Tacitus and Suetonius testify, was apt to suspect the worst, and always punished the least crimes relative thereto with death. <span class="ital">Whosoever maketh himself a king — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">maketh, </span>or <span class="ital">calleth himself king, speaketh against Cesar. </span>So Dr. Campbell reads the clause, observing, “the sentence is true, when <span class="greekheb">βασιλεα </span>[the word here used] is rendered <span class="ital">king, </span>but not when rendered <span class="ital">a king. </span>Judea, at that time, together with Syria, to which it was annexed, made a province of the empire. Nothing is more certain than that whoever in Judea called himself <span class="ital">king, </span>in the sense wherein the word was commonly understood, opposed Cesar. But it did not therefore hold, that whosoever called himself <span class="ital">a king, </span>opposed Cesar. For if the kingdom to which he laid claim was without the bounds of the Roman empire, the title in nowise interfered with the rights of the emperor.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-18 Little did Pilate think with what holy regard these sufferings of Christ would, in after-ages, be thought upon and spoken of by the best and greatest of men. Our Lord Jesus came forth, willing to be exposed to their scorn. It is good for every one with faith, to behold Christ Jesus in his sufferings. Behold him, and love him; be still looking unto Jesus. Did their hatred sharpen their endeavours against him? and shall not our love for him quicken our endeavours for him and his kingdom? Pilate seems to have thought that Jesus might be some person above the common order. Even natural conscience makes men afraid of being found fighting against God. As our Lord suffered for the sins both of Jews and Gentiles, it was a special part of the counsel of Divine Wisdom, that the Jews should first purpose his death, and the Gentiles carry that purpose into effect. Had not Christ been thus rejected of men, we had been for ever rejected of God. Now was the Son of man delivered into the hands of wicked and unreasonable men. He was led forth for us, that we might escape. He was nailed to the cross, as a Sacrifice bound to the altar. The Scripture was fulfilled; he did not die at the altar among the sacrifices, but among criminals sacrificed to public justice. And now let us pause, and with faith look upon Jesus. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? See him bleeding, see him dying, see him and love him! love him, and live to him!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When Pilate therefore heard that saying - That they had accused him of blasphemy. As this was not the charge on which they had arraigned him before his bar, he had not before heard it, and it now convinced him more of their malignity and wickedness.<p>He was the more afraid - What was the ground of his fear is not declared by the evangelist. It was probably, however, the alarm of his conscience, and the fear of vengeance if he suffered such an act of injustice to be done as to put an innocent man to death. He was convinced of his innocence. He saw more and more clearly the design of the Jews; and it is not improbable that a pagan, who believed that the gods often manifested themselves to people, dreaded their vengeance if he suffered one who claimed to be divine, and who might be, to be put to death. It is clear that Pilate was convinced that Jesus was innocent; and in this state of agitation between the convictions of his own conscience, and the clamors of the Jews, and the fear of vengeance, and the certainty that he would do wrong if he gave him up, he was thrown into this state of alarm, and resolved again to question Jesus, that he might obtain satisfaction on the subjects that agitated his mind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-11.

Superstition goes hand in hand with skepticism. Instead of this being (as Keim says) contrary to psychologic laws, the history of skepticism is constantly presenting the same features (cf. Herod Antipas the Sadducee, who would dogmatically have repudiated the idea of resurrection, crying out concerning Jesus, "It is John the Baptist, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead," etc.). We need not suppose that Pilate was suddenly affected by the truth of Jewish monotheism; but he may readily have believed that the wondrous Being before him was enshrouded in a mystery of supernatural portent and pretension that he could not fathom, and before which he trembled. The idea of Divine energy enshrined in and wielded by human beings was not altogether foreign to heathen thought - and one centurion, at least, who was probably present on this very occasion, exclaimed that Jesus was a Son of God (<a href="/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The more afraid<p>"These words of the Jews produced an effect on Pilate for which they were not prepared.

Was this extraordinary man truly a divine being who had appeared on the earth? The truth naturally presents itself to his mind in the form of pagan superstitions and mythological legends" (Godet). </body></html>
