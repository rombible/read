On the other hand (1) St. John’s custom is to quote the fulfilment of Scripture as seen in the event after its occurrence; (2) he does not here use the ordinary words which accompany such a reference; (3) the actual meaning of “knowing that all things were now accomplished” seems to exclude the idea of a further accomplishment, and to refer to the whole life which was an accomplishment of Scripture; (4) the context of words as they occur in the Psalm (<a href="/john/19-22.htm" title="Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.">John 19:22</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) cannot be understood of our Lord.

Pilate would not gratify the chief priests by allowing the writing to be altered; which was doubtless owing to a secret power of God upon his heart, that this statement of our Lord's character and authority might continue. Many things done by the Roman soldiers were fulfilments of the prophecies of the Old Testament. All things therein written shall be fulfilled. Christ tenderly provided for his mother at his death. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort from us, he raises up another for us, where we looked not for it. Christ's example teaches all men to honour their parents in life and death; to provide for their wants, and to promote their comfort by every means in their power. Especially observe the dying word wherewith Jesus breathed out his soul. It is finished; that is, the counsels of the Father concerning his sufferings were now fulfilled. It is finished; all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament, which pointed at the sufferings of the Messiah, were accomplished. It is finished; the ceremonial law is abolished; the substance is now come, and all the shadows are done away. It is finished; an end is made of transgression by bringing in an everlasting righteousness. His sufferings were now finished, both those of his soul, and those of his body. It is finished; the work of man's redemption and salvation is now completed. His life was not taken from him by force, but freely given up.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46-50</a>.<p>That the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst - See <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>. Thirst was one of the most distressing circumstances attending the crucifixion. The wounds were highly inflamed, and a raging fever was caused, usually, by the sufferings on the cross, and this was accompanied by insupportable thirst. See the notes at <a href="/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>. A Mameluke, or Turkish officer, was crucified, it is said in an Arabic manuscript recently translated, on the banks of the Barada River, under the castle of Damascus. He was nailed to the cross on Friday, and remained until Sunday noon, when he died. After giving an account of the crucifixion, the narrator proceeds: "I have heard this from one who witnessed it; and he thus remained until he died, patient and silent, without wailing, but looking around him to the right and the left, upon the people. But he begged for water, and none was given him; and the hearts of the people were melted with compassion for him, and with pity on one of God's creatures, who, yet a boy, was suffering under so grievous a trial. In the meantime the water was flowing around him, and he gazed upon it, and longed for one drop of it; and he complained of thirst all the first day, after which he was silent, for God gave him strength" - Wiseman's Lectures, pp. 164, 165, ed.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-30. After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished&#8212;that is, the moment for the fulfilment of the last of them; for there was one other small particular, and the time was come for that too, in consequence of the burning thirst which the fevered state of His frame occasioned (Ps 22:15).<p>that the scripture&#8212;(Ps 69:21).<p>might be fulfilled saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar&#8212;on the offer of the soldiers' vinegar, see on [1912]Joh 19:24.<p>and they&#8212;"one of them," (Mt 27:48).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 28,29.

Part of these words were without a figure literally fulfilled in Christ, who was the Son of David; for he crying out upon the cross that he thirsted, there being no other liquor at hand, or this being set on purpose for this end, they dip a spunge in it, and give it to him to drink; whether to stupify his sense, or to prolong his life in those torments, or barely to quench his thirst, is hard to determine. It is probable that it was such a kind of refreshment as they allowed to ordinary malefactors in his circumstances, the particulars of which usage we are not able to determine. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>After this,....

The apparent contradiction almost disappears when we remember that the thirst had been felt sometime before it was expressed. All things were finished, including the thirst; but Christ alone knew this. In order that the prophecy <span class="ital">might be</span> <span class="bld">accomplished</span>, it was necessary that He should make known His thirst. ‘Brought to its due end’ or ‘made perfect’ is the natural meaning of the very unusual expression translated ‘fulfilled.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/19-28.htm" title="After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.">John 19:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μετὰ τοῦτο</span>, <span class="ital">after this</span>) <span class="ital">after this</span> one event which immediately preceded. [After the <span class="ital">parting of the garments</span>, whereby the Scripture which was immediately before quoted by John obtained its fulfilment.—V. g.] [The conjecture is somewhat different, which is exhibited almost in these words in the <span class="ital">Harm</span>., p. 569: “The phrase <span class="greekheb">μετὰ τοῦτο</span> seems rather to refer to the whole <span class="ital">Acts of the crucifixion</span>, than the <span class="ital">address</span> to His mother and the disciple mentioned in <a href="/context/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!...">John 19:26-27</a>, as <span class="ital">immediately preceding</span>. For John, having brought Mary to his dwelling, returned to the cross, <a href="/john/19-35.htm" title="And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.">John 19:35</a>; from which we may gather the inference, that not only was she brought into the house out of the open air <span class="ital">before the darkness</span>, but even that immediately <span class="ital">after the first</span> word spoken by Jesus on the cross, which was directed to <span class="ital">the Father, the second</span> word had regard to His mother, whom He observed beneath His cross.” Let the impartial Reader weigh well in what way best the statements which the Gnomon has, as to the order of these events, can be made to harmonise with those which we have now brought forward, as well from the <span class="ital">Harm. Ev</span>. as also from the Germ Vers.—E. B.] <span class="greekheb">Τοῦτο</span> differs from <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>, ch. <a href="/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>. The former is never taken adverbially.—<span class="greekheb">εἰδὼς</span>, <span class="ital">knowing</span>) Believers also, in the agony of the last conflict, may perceive that the issue (end) is near.—<span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>, <span class="ital">all things</span>) for instance, those things which are recorded in <a href="/john/19-24.htm" title="They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, They parted my raiment among them, and for my clothing they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.">John 19:24</a>, even concerning minor matters.—<span class="greekheb">τετέλεσται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα τελειωθῇ</span>) The verb <span class="greekheb">τελέω</span> applies to events; <span class="greekheb">τελειόω</span>, to Holy Scripture. The verb <span class="greekheb">διψῶ</span>, I <span class="ital">thirst</span>, and the verb <span class="greekheb">τετέλεσται</span>, it is finished (‘consummated’), are closely connected. The thirst had been, in the case of the body of Jesus, what the dereliction by the Father had been in His soul. In His journey on foot He had felt weariness (ch. <a href="/john/4-6.htm" title="Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6</a>); in His voyage, He had been overpowered by sleep (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm" title="And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, care you not that we perish?">Mark 4:38</a>); in the desert previously, He had felt hunger (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm" title="And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.">Matthew 4:2</a>); and now, in fine, on the cross, the most extreme and burning thirst, after His sweat, His goings back and forward [between Caiaphas, Herod, Pilate, and the people], His speaking, His scourging, and the nails. Amidst all these He had not said, <span class="ital">He is in pain</span>; for the fact spoke for itself as to His pains, which were foretold in Scripture; but He does speak of His <span class="ital">thirst</span>, in which all the rest have their confluence and termination, and thereby He asks for a drink. For the Scripture had foretold both the thirst and the drink. Thirst is wont both to be felt most, and to be quenched, only then when one’s toil has been completely ended: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>, may be joined with <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, <span class="ital">He saith</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - (c) "I thirst" - the last agony. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - It does not come within the purpose of John to record the portents which attended the final scene - either the supernatural darkness on the one hand, or the rending of the veil of the temple on the other. He does not record the visions of the saints, nor the testimony of the centurion (see <a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45-56</a>; <a href="/mark/15-33.htm">Mark 15:33-39</a>; <a href="/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44-49</a>). He does not record the further quotation of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>; the cry, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" nor the misinterpretation of the multitudes; nor the jeer at his dying agonies. But he does record two of the words of the Lord, which they had omitted. He, moreover, implies that he had purposely left these omissions to be filled up from the synoptists, for he adds, <span class="cmt_word">After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had been</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">now finished, said, I thirst, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> John heard in this word the comprehensive cry which gathered up all the yearnings and agonies of his soul, which fulfilled its travail, which expressed the awful significance of his suffering, and strangely filled up the prophetic picture (<a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Were accomplished (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., with stricter rendering of the perfect tense, are finished.
