But the law of Moses expressly prohibited the Jews from suffering the bodies of those who were hanged to remain all night on the trees, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm" title="And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>; for that reason, as well as because the sabbath was at hand, which would have been profaned by their remaining, especially as that sabbath was a day of peculiar solemnity, being the second day of the feast of unleavened bread, (from whence they reckoned the weeks to pentecost,) and also the day for presenting and offering the sheaf of new corn; therefore, <span class="ital">the Jews besought </span>Pilate that the legs of the three crucified persons might be broken, to hasten their death; and Pilate consented, and gave the order they desired. <span class="ital">Then came the soldiers </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who guarded the execution; <span class="ital">and brake the legs of the first </span>— Malefactor, or of him that hung nearest the place where they had been sitting; and then, passing by Jesus, who hung in the middle, they went and brake the legs <span class="ital">of the other, who was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, </span>perceiving <span class="ital">that he was dead already — </span>They did not take the trouble of breaking his legs; <span class="ital">but one of the soldiers </span>— Had so much boldness and inhumanity that, <span class="ital">with a spear, </span>which he had in his hand, he <span class="ital">pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water </span>— Real blood and real water; the spear having pierced both the pericardium and heart, the water issuing from the former and the blood from the latter; a wound which must inevitably have killed him, had he been living when it was given, and which consequently put it out of all doubt that he was really dead, before he was taken down from the cross; a point of infinite importance to be ascertained. For the grand evidence of Christ’s mission is his resurrection, which implies the certainty of his death. On that account, crucifixion might have seemed, on a slight view, a less proper execution than some others, such as <span class="ital">beheading, burning, </span>and the like; but this wound, which pierced his heart, would effectually exclude all pretences of his having been taken down alive by his friends; and hence, false and malicious as his enemies were, we do not find that they ever had recourse to such an evasion. Accordingly, as it was of such importance to mankind to be ascertained of the truth of Christ’s death, the evangelist here, in speaking of it, attests this circumstance, which demonstrates it, as being a thing which he himself saw; saying, <span class="ital">And he that saw it bare record, &c., and he knoweth </span>— By the most certain testimony of his senses; <span class="ital">that he saith true </span>— And he makes this declaration that you, whoever you are, into whose hands this history may come, <span class="ital">may believe </span>— And may be confirmed in your adherence to that gospel which is established on the death and resurrection of Christ. Of the mystical meaning of the blood and water which issued out of the side of Christ, see the note on <a href="/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1 John 5:6</a>. <span class="ital">For these things were done </span>— Or were permitted to be done, in the course of divine providence, however inconsiderable they may appear, <span class="ital">that the scripture should be fulfilled — </span>That is, Jesus’s legs were not broken, that the passage, (<a href="/exodus/12-46.htm" title="In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone thereof.">Exodus 12:46</a>,) <span class="ital">Neither shall ye break a bone thereof, </span>might be fulfilled. “These words were primarily spoken of the paschal lamb, whose bones were not to be broken, that it might be a fit representation of the Messiah, typified by this sacrifice; and who, though he was to suffer a violent death, was to have none of his bones broken, because he was to rise from the dead on the third day. Wherefore, as the scripture which speaks of the type has necessarily a reference to the antitype, the evangelist had good reason to interpret what is there said of the paschal lamb, as prophetical of this circumstance of our Lord’s death. And the rather, as by so doing he makes his readers sensible it was not owing to accident that the soldiers treated Christ’s body otherwise than they treated the bodies of those who were crucified with him. It happened by the direction of God, who had always determined that Christ should rise from the dead, and that his mission should be fully demonstrated by the evidence of miracles and prophecies united. John observes also, that Christ’s side was pierced with a spear, because another scripture (<a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>) had said <span class="ital">They shall look on him whom they have pierced;” </span>that is, they who have occasioned his sufferings by their sins, (and who has not?) shall either look upon him in this world with penitential sorrow, or with terror when he cometh in the clouds of heaven, <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:31-37 A trial was made whether Jesus was dead. He died in less time than persons crucified commonly did. It showed that he had laid down his life of himself. The spear broke up the very fountains of life; no human body could survive such a wound. But its being so solemnly attested, shows there was something peculiar in it. The blood and water that flowed out, signified those two great benefits which all believers partake of through Christ, justification and sanctification; blood for atonement, water for purification. They both flow from the pierced side of our Redeemer. To Christ crucified we owe merit for our justification, and Spirit and grace for our sanctification. Let this silence the fears of weak Christians, and encourage their hopes; there came both water and blood out of Jesus' pierced side, both to justify and sanctify them. The Scripture was fulfilled, in Pilate's not allowing his legs to be broken, Ps 34:20. There was a type of this in the paschal lamb, Ex 12:46. May we ever look to Him, whom, by our sins, we have ignorantly and heedlessly pierced, nay, sometimes against convictions and mercies; and who shed from his wounded side both water and blood, that we might be justified and sanctified in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The preparation - <a href="/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>.<p>That the bodies ... - The law required that the bodies of those who were hung should not remain suspended during the night. See <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>. That law was made when the punishment by crucifixion was unknown, and when those who were suspended would almost immediately expire. In the punishment by crucifixion, life was lengthened out for four, five, or eight days. The Jews therefore requested that their death might be hastened, and that the land might not be polluted by their bodies remaining suspended on the Sabbath day.<p>Was an high day - It was:<p>1.

Greek: "Great day."<p>Their legs might be broken - To hasten their death. The effect of this, while they were suspended on the cross, would be to increase their pain by the act of breaking them, and to deprive their body of the support which it received from the feet, and to throw the whole weight on the hands. By this increased torment their lives were soon ended. Lactantius says that this was commonly done by the Romans to persons who were crucified. The common period to which persons crucified would live was several days. To compensate for those lingering agonies, so that the full amount of suffering might be endured, they increased their sufferings by breaking their limbs, and thus hastening their death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Joh 19:31-42.

That is, either of the passover, as in <a href="/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a> which was the Chagigah or grand festival in which they offered their peace offerings and slew their oxen, and feasted together in great mirth and jollity; or of the sabbath, the evening of it, or day before it, as in <a href="/mark/15-42.htm">Mark 15:42</a><p>that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day; which was now drawing near: according to the Jewish law, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a> the body of one that was hanged on a tree was not to remain all night, but to be taken down that day and buried; though this was not always observed; see <a href="/2_samuel/21-9.htm">2 Samuel 21:9</a>. What was the usage of the Jews at this time is not certain; according to the Roman laws, such bodies hung until they were putrefied, or eaten by birds of prey; wherefore that their land might not be defiled, and especially their sabbath, by their remaining on the cross, they desire to have them taken down: <p>for that sabbath day was an high day; it was not only a sabbath, and a sabbath in the passover week, but it was the day in which all the people appeared and presented themselves before the Lord in the temple, and the sheaf of the first fruits was offered up; all which solemnities meeting together made it a very celebrated day: it is in the original text, "it was the great day of the sabbath"; which is the language of the Talmudists, and who say (d), <p>  "is called the great sabbath", on account of the miracle or sign of the passover;'' <p>and in the Jewish Liturgy (e) there is a collect for the "great sabbath": hence the Jews pretending a great concern lest that day should be polluted, though they made no conscience of shedding innocent blood, <p>besought Pilate that their legs might be broken; which was the manner of the Jews (f), partly to hasten death, since, according to their law, the body was to betaken down before night; and partly that it might be a clear point that the person was rightly executed; for this was not the Roman custom, with whom breaking of the legs, or rather thighs, was a distinct punishment, and was done by laying a man's legs or thighs upon an anvil, and striking them with an hammer (g); which could not be the case here; this seems to have been done by striking the legs of those that were crucified, which were fastened to the cross, with a bar of iron, or some such instrument. Nonnus suggests that their legs were cut off with a saw or sword; but the former seems more reasonable: <p>and that they might be taken away; which it seems the Jews had not power to do, but must be done by the Roman soldiers, or by leave at least from the Roman governor; and therefore they make their request to him. <p>(d) Piske Tosephot Sabbat, art. 314.

It also appears as a punishment by itself, Suetonius, <span class="ital">Aug</span>. 67; Seneca, <span class="ital">de ira</span>, iii. 32; and see generally Wetstein, also Lipsius, <span class="ital">ad Plaut</span>. <span class="ital">Asin</span>. ii. 4. 68. The addition of a <span class="ital">finishing blow</span>, by which (therefore not by the crucifragium in itself) death was brought about, cannot be shown, least of all, from <a href="/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>, against Michaelis, Sender, Kuinoel, Hug.

The Jews still continue their relentless hostility. They do not know whether any one of the three sufferers is dead or not; their request shews that; so that ‘therefore’ cannot mean in consequence of Jesus’ death. In order to save the Sabbath, and perhaps also to inflict still further suffering, they ask Pilate for this terrible addition to the punishment of crucifixion. Certainly the lesson ‘I will have mercy and not sacrifice,’ of which Christ had twice reminded them, and once in connexion with the Sabbath (<a href="/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.">Matthew 12:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>), had taken no hold on them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the preparation</span>] The <span class="ital">eve</span> of the Sabbath; and the Sabbath on this occasion coincided with the 15th Nisan, the first day of the Passover.

The two were sometimes combined, as here. Lactantius (iv. xxvi) says, ‘His executioners did not think it necessary to break His bones, <span class="ital">as was their prevailing custom</span>;’ which seems to imply that to Jewish crucifixions this horror was commonly added, perhaps to hasten death. For even without a Sabbath to make matters more urgent, corpses ought to be removed before night-fall (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm" title="His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>); whereas the Roman custom was to leave them to putrefy on the cross, like our obsolete custom of hanging in chains.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/19-31.htm" title="The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) sought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.">John 19:31</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν τῷ Σαββάτῳ</span>, <span class="ital">on the Sabbath</span>) This special reason includes that general reason, of which <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm" title="His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> speaks: The criminal’s “body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him on that day (for he that is hanged is accursed of God), that thy land be not defiled.”—<span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) This assigns the reason why the Preparation (<span class="greekheb">παρασκευή</span>) urged them to make haste.—<span class="greekheb">μεγάλη</span>, <span class="ital">a great</span>) inasmuch as the Sabbath and the Feast met together on the same day: add, that the Rest of the Lord in the sepulchre was an accessory circumstance of its greatness [though this was not perceived by the Jews].—<span class="greekheb">ἐκείνου</span>) This is a more appropriate reading than <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνη</span>;[393] for the word <span class="greekheb">σαββάτῳ</span> precedes, and <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνου</span> is to be referred to it.—<span class="greekheb">κατεαγῶσιν</span>, <span class="ital">might be broken</span>) Thomas Magister denies that the augment has place here, and reads <span class="greekheb">κατεάγωσιν</span>, like <span class="greekheb">τετύφωσιν</span> [the Middle Perf.

This note of time certainly blends both the synoptists and John in the assurance that the crucifixion took place on a Friday. It was also, according to the previous statement, the preparation of the Passover, which, we have seen, is better understood in that literal sense than in the sense of "the Friday of Passover week." Consequently, there was a twofold sanctity about that particular sabbath, seeing that the sabbatic rest of the day following the Paschal meal coincided with the ordinary weekly sabbath; (<span class="cmt_word">for great, or high, was the day of that sabbath</span>) (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7</a>; and notes on John 13:1; 18:28; 19:14). It was a "great" and "high" day in a sense far more profoundly impressive than any that could be derived from the ceremonial enactments of the Hebrew code. The sabbath of his rest came at length. The toil, the agony, are over, the whole world is transformed during its hours into his resting-place. There has been no such sabbath since the creative Word rested from all his work. <span class="cmt_word">In order that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath.</span> This statement, with the events which followed, strongly confirms our interpretation of the day of the Crucifixion. The Jews would scarcely have justified a crucifixion on the first sabbatic day of the feast, if they shrank from the proceeding here described as in danger of taking place on the ordinary sabbath. They follow the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a>) so far as it would apply, and hasten the dissolution of the crucified, if it had not already occurred.
