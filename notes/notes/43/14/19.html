(Comp. <a href="/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>.)

I will not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily to you at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in the tokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly at the end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shall see him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming; but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. These mysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace, that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ's commands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keep them in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christ is, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens of Christ and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love to Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be a commanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty follows from a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedient believers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in love to them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges are confined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesus leads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the Holy Spirit's new-creating grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A little while - This was the day before his death.<p>Seeth me no more - No more until the day of judgment.

You will continue to see me by the eye of faith as still your gracious Saviour and Friend.<p>Because I live - Though the Saviour was about to die, yet was he also about to be raised from the dead. He was to continue to live, and though absent from them, yet he would feel the same interest in their welfare as when he was with them on earth. This expression does not refer "particularly" to his "resurrection," but his "continuing to live." He had a nature which could not die. As Mediator also he would be raised and continue to live: and he would have both power and inclination to give them also life, to defend them, and bring them with him.<p>Ye shall live also - This doubtless refers to their future life. And we learn from this:<p>1. That the life of the Christian depends on that of Christ. They are united; and if they were separated, the Christian could neither enjoy spiritual life here nor eternal joy hereafter.<p>2. The fact that Jesus lives is a pledge that all who believe in him shall he saved. He has power over all our spiritual foes, and he can deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and from all temptations and trials. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. world seeth&#8212;beholdeth.<p>me no more, but ye see&#8212;behold.<p>me&#8212;His bodily presence, being all the sight of Him which "the world" ever had, or was capable of, it "beheld Him no more" after His departure to the Father; but by the coming of the Spirit, the presence of Christ was not only continued to His spiritually enlightened disciples, but rendered far more efficacious and blissful than His bodily presence had been before the Spirit's coming.<p>because I live&#8212;not "shall live," only when raised from the dead; for it is His unextinguishable, divine life of which He speaks, in view of which His death and resurrection were but as shadows passing over the sun's glorious disk. (Compare Lu 24:5; Re 1:18, "the Living One"). And this grand saying Jesus uttered with death immediately in view. What a brightness does this throw over the next clause, "ye shall live also!" "Knowest thou not," said Luther to the King of Terrors, "that thou didst devour the Lord Christ, but wert obliged to give Him back, and wert devoured of Him? So thou must leave me undevoured because I abide in Him, and live and suffer for His name's sake. Men may hunt me out of the world&#8212;that I care not for&#8212;but I shall not on that account abide in death. I shall live with my Lord Christ, since I know and believe that He liveth!"

The men of the world now see me with their bodily eyes, which is all the sight they have of me; and this they will be deprived of in a very little time; they will see me no more until the time that I shall come in the clouds of heaven to judge the world; and then every eye shall see me: <p>but ye see me; ye see me now, and shall see me after my resurrection, as they did; for then he appeared alive and conversed with them for forty days; and when he ascended into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God, they saw him by faith crowned with glory and honour; and will see him as he is when he comes a second time to take them to himself in glory. <p>Because I live, ye shall believe also: Christ lives as God, as man, and as Mediator: as God, he lives the same life his Father does, partaking of the same nature, and possessing the same perfections; so he lived from everlasting, and will live to everlasting; as man, he lived first a private, and then a public life, attended with meanness, reproaches, sorrows, and sufferings; a life which was filled up with acts of devotion and piety to God, and with doing good to the bodies and souls of men; he lived in all obedience to the law of God, and at last endured the penalty of that law, in the room and stead of his people; when his life was taken away for a while, and then taken up by him again; and now, as man, he lives, and lives for evermore. As Mediator, he has his life from the Father, which is dependent upon him, by whom he was set up in an office capacity from everlasting; and as such will live to everlasting, to see the travail of his soul, the fruit of his sufferings, to make intercession for his people, and to rule until all enemies are made his footstool. And his people "live also", which is to be understood, not of the preservation of his disciples from dying with him, when he died; for then it should rather have been said, "because I die, ye shall live": nor of the continuance of their natural life in this world; for the saints are not to live always here; nor do they desire it, nor is it proper they should; death is for their advantage; it is a blessing to them. Though these words may be understood of a corporeal life, which they shall live after the resurrection; for though they die, they shall live again, and never die more; they shall not only live and reign with Christ a thousand years, but to all eternity. They also live a spiritual life now; a life of grace and holiness from Christ; a life of faith on him, and sometimes of communion with him, and desire to live to his honour and glory; and shall hereafter live an eternal life of perfection and pleasure, with Father, Son, and Spirit, for evermore. Now between these two lives, the life of Christ, and his people, there is a close connection; the one is dependent on the other, and secured by the other: "because I live, ye shall live also"; the spiritual life of a believer is from Christ, and is maintained by him; the same which is in the head, is in the members; yea, it is not so much they that live, as Christ that lives in them, and therefore their life can never be lost; it is bound up in the bundle of life with Christ, and is hid safe and secure with him in God, and so out of the reach both of men and devils. The corporeal life of the saints after death, in the resurrection morn, springs from, and is secured by the life of Christ: his resurrection from the dead is the pattern and pledge of theirs; he undertook to raise them from the dead, and will do it; as sure as his dead body is raised and lives, so sure shall theirs; their bodies, as well as their souls, are united to Christ; and by virtue of this union, which death does not, and cannot dissolve, they shall be raised and live again. They are in Christ whilst they are dead; and because they are "the dead in Christ", they shall "rise first". Their eternal life is in the hands of Christ, and when he, who is the true God, and their eternal life, shall appear, they shall appear with him in glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/john/14-19.htm" title="Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.">John 14:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔτι μικρ</span>.] <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span>.

Note the change from the present to the future, and that <span class="greekheb">ζῶ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ζήσεσθε</span> cannot without arbitrariness be taken as essentially different in idea, but that <span class="greekheb">ζῶ</span> manifestly, since it exists without interruption (present), denotes <span class="ital">the higher life of Christ independent of death</span>, of Christ, who, by His departure to the Father, becomes a partaker of the heavenly <span class="ital">glory</span>. Christ <span class="ital">lives</span>, for He is, indeed, Himself the Possessor and bearer of the true <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> (comp. <a href="/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>); death, which translates Him into the glory of the Father, by no means breaks off this true and higher life of His (although His life <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span> ceases), but is only the medium of the consummation and transfiguration of this His <span class="greekheb">ζῆν</span> into the everlasting heavenly <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> and <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> (comp. <a href="/context/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God....">Colossians 3:3-4</a>). Out of <span class="ital">this</span> consciousness the Lord here utters the words: <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ ζῶ</span>. And He adds thereto: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς ζήσεσθε</span>: <span class="ital">and you shall live, i.e</span>. you shall be partakers (in its temporal development on to its glorious consummation) of the same higher <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>, liable to no death (<a href="/john/11-26.htm" title="And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?">John 11:26</a>), under the life-giving (<a href="/john/6-33.htm" title="For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.">John 6:33</a>) influence of the Spirit. “Stat enim illud fixum, nullam fore <span class="ital">ejus</span> vitam <span class="ital">membris</span> mortuis,” Calvin. Thus the life is in both essentially <span class="ital">alike</span>, only with this difference, that it is original in Jesus, and with His approaching departure is already at its glorious consummation; but in the case of the disciples, being imparted by Christ in the Holy Spirit, who is the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς ζωῆς</span> (<a href="/romans/8-2.htm" title="For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.">Romans 8:2</a>), it is, in the first instance, to be unfolded within (before the Parousia as the living fellowship with the exalted Christ), in order to become, at the Parousia by means of the resurrection (<a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>) and relative transformation (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,...">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>), the participation in His <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. Comp. the idea of the <span class="greekheb">συζῆν τῷ Χριστῷ</span> in Paul, <a href="/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you.">2 Corinthians 7:3</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2 Timothy 2:11</a>. The moment which <span class="ital">assigns the reason</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) lies simply in this, that the above two-sided <span class="greekheb">ζῆν</span> is the necessary condition of the promised <span class="greekheb">θεωρεῖτέ με</span>. If the higher <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>, that is meant, were to be the lot only of Christ, and not also thereafter (through the working of the Spirit) that of the disciples, there could be no mention of a beholding of the Lord on the part of the disciples. The <span class="ital">paritas rationis</span> for the mutual relation would be wanting, and thereby the disciples would lose the capacity (the eye, as it were) to see Christ. But thus <span class="ital">the living behold the Living One</span>. The reference to the resurrection of Jesus has led to interpretations like that of Grotius (comp. Euth. Zigabenus): you shall see me <span class="ital">actually alive</span> (“non spectrum”) and <span class="ital">remaining in life</span> amidst the impending dangers; or (so Theophylact, comp. Kuinoel): I shall, as having risen, be <span class="ital">alive</span>, and you shall be as <span class="ital">newly made alive</span> for <span class="ital">joy!</span> or: <span class="ital">I rise again</span>, and you shall (at the last day) <span class="ital">arise</span> (so Augustine). Again the interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ζήσεσθε</span> in Weiss (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 70) of the new life, which arises in the disciples through the reappearance of the Risen One, who is recognised by them (as in the case of Thomas, <a href="/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>), is a forced expedient, proceeding from an erroneous assumption, and is not appropriate, moreover, to <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ</span>, <a href="/john/14-20.htm" title="At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.">John 14:20</a>, which is definite and valid for all disciples, nor to the intimate reciprocal confidence of <a href="/context/john/14-20.htm" title="At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you....">John 14:20-21</a>; wherefore Weiss again, adding violence to violence, explains <a href="/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a> of the further unfolding of the new communion begun with the appearances of the Risen One (p. 276). Had the resurrection been spoken of, the simplest explanation would be that of Kaeuffer, p. 136: “quae instat fortunae vicissitudo nec me nec vos poterit pessumdare,” according to which, however, a thought of much too small importance would result, and, besides, the change of tense is overlooked. But if, according to the above, both <span class="greekheb">ζῶ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ζήσεσθε</span> must embrace time and eternity, then De Wette has incorrectly limited <span class="greekheb">ζήσεσθε</span> to the <span class="ital">life of faith</span> with its joyous victory over death and the fear of death; on the other side again, Luthardt has erroneously understood it only of the <span class="ital">life of transfiguration</span> after the Parousia, because <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ ζῶ</span> can only denote the glorified life,—an assumption, however, which is unsupported, since the expression used is not <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ ζήσομαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[152] Not: through the <span class="ital">being caught away to me at the Parousia</span> (Luthardt).

In a short time, <span class="greekheb">ἔτι μικρόν</span>, the world would no longer see Him, but His disciples would be conscious of His presence, <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς δὲ θεωρεῖτέ με</span>, present for immediate future. His presence would be manifested in their new life which they would trace to Him, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐγὼ ζῶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς ζήσεσθε</span>.

Jesus here passed over the concrete fact of the Resurrection, to return to it afterwards. We know that the resurrection of his body and his victory over death became <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the condition of his sending the Spirit, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the proof of his being the living One whom death could not hold, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the ground of the higher appreciation of the relation they sustained to him. But he fixed their attention on his continuous life (in spite of death), and their consequent life under the shadow of his Divine protection, without specifically mentioning the Resurrection, of which he had (in synoptic narrative) given them explicit but misapprehended prophecies. This version seems to be preferable to making the last clause <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., a reason of the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> - a view advocated as possible by Meyer and Luthardt; or than the view which limits the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;</span> to the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>: "Ye see me because I live, and as a consequence of this vision ye shall live also." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye shall live also (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>This may also be rendered, and ye shall live, explaining the former statement, ye behold me. So Rev., in margin. This is better. John is not arguing for the dependence of their life on Christ's, but for fellowship with Christ as the ground of spiritual vision. </body></html>
