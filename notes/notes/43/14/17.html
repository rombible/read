not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1John 5:6</a>. He is called the Spirit of Truth, because part of His special office is to bring truth home to the hearts of men, to carry it from the material to the moral sphere, to make it something more than a collection of signs seen or heard—a living power in living men.<p><span class= "bld">Whom the world cannot receive.</span>—The Holy Spirit can be received only by those who have the spiritual faculty. It cannot be otherwise. The unbelieving world, caring only for things of the senses, has lost its spiritual perception. It has no eye to see and no heart to know spiritual things, for they are spiritually discerned. (Comp. Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1Corinthians 2:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</span>—The better text is,. . . . <span class= "ital">and is in you.</span> The verbs are in the present tense, describing the receptivity of the disciples as opposed to the moral blindness of the world. They had, during our Lord’s work and teaching in their midst, exercised and strengthened their spiritual faculties. They had in part received the Spirit, and by that reception were prepared for the fuller gift. They knew Him. He was in their midst. He was then, and therefore should be in the future, a living power, dwelling in their inmost life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:12-17 Whatever we ask in Christ's name, that shall be for our good, and suitable to our state, he shall give it to us. To ask in Christ's name, is to plead his merit and intercession, and to depend upon that plea. The gift of the Spirit is a fruit of Christ's mediation, bought by his merit, and received by his intercession. The word used here, signifies an advocate, counsellor, monitor, and comforter. He would abide with the disciples to the end of time; his gifts and graces would encourage their hearts. The expressions used here and elsewhere, plainly denote a person, and the office itself includes all the Divine perfections. The gift of the Holy Ghost is bestowed upon the disciples of Christ, and not on the world. This is the favour God bears to his chosen. As the source of holiness and happiness, the Holy Spirit will abide with every believer for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Spirit of truth - He is thus called here because he would teach them the truth, or would guide them into all truth, <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>. He would keep them from all error, and teach them the truth, which, either by writing or preaching, they were to communicate to others.<p>The world - The term world is often used to denote all who are entirely under the influence of the things of this world - pride, ambition, and pleasure; all who are not Christians, and especially all who are addicted to gross vices and pursuits, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>.<p>Cannot receive - Cannot admit as a Teacher or Comforter, or cannot receive in his offices of enlightening and purifying. The reason why they could not do this is immediately added.<p>Because it seeth him not - The men of the world are under the influence of the senses. They walk by sight, and not by faith. Hence, what they cannot perceive by their senses, what does not gratify their sight, or taste, or feeling, makes no impression on them. As they cannot see the operations of the Spirit <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>, they judge that all that is said of his influence is delusive, and hence, they cannot receive him. They have an erroneous mode of judging of what is for the welfare of man.<p>Neither knoweth him - To know, in the Scriptures, often means more than the act of the mind in simply understanding a thing. It denotes every act or emotion of the mind that is requisite in receiving the proper impression of a truth. Hence, it often includes the idea of "approbation," of "love," of "cordial feeling," <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-7.htm">Nahum 1:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>. In this place it means the approbation of the heart; and as the people of the world do not approve of or desire the aid of the Spirit, so it is said they cannot receive him. They have no love for him, and they reject him. Men often consider his work in the conversion of sinners and in revivals as delusion. They love the world so much that they cannot understand his work or embrace him.<p>He dwelleth in you - The Spirit dwells in Christians by his sacred influences. There is no personal union, no physical indwelling, for God is essentially present in one place as much as in another; but he works in us repentance, peace, joy, meekness, etc. He teaches us, guides us, and comforts us. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-24</a>. Thus, he is said to dwell in us when we are made pure, peaceable, holy, humble; when we become like him, and cherish his sacred influences. The word "dwelleth" means to remain with them. Jesus was to be taken away, but the Spirit would remain. It is also implied that they would know his presence, and have assurance that they were under his guidance. This was true of the apostles as inspired men, and it is true of all Christians that by ascertaining that they have the "graces of the Spirit" - joy, peace, long-suffering, etc. they know that they are the children of God, <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. whom the world cannot receive, &c.&#8212;(See 1Co 2:14).<p>he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you&#8212;Though the proper fulness of both these was yet future, our Lord, by using both the present and the future, seems plainly to say that they already had the germ of this great blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He here explains himself, and tells them, that by that other Comforter, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a></span>, he meant the Spirit; whom he here calls <span class="ital">the Spirit of truth, </span> either because he is a Spirit that declareth and revealeth the truth, as in <span class="bld"><a href="/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.

They see Him in His operations. Unbelievers also see Him in His operations; but they do not perceive that it is He, and that He is the Spirit of truth; wherefore they cannot receive Him: whereas believers not only see Him, but also perceive that He is the same Spirit.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">ye</span>) This is the emphatic word in the sentence.—<span class="greekheb">γινώσκετε</span>, <span class="ital">ye know</span>) This denotes an event immediately about to take place.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">because</span>) From the indwelling of the Spirit comes the intimate acquaintance: <a href="/context/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him....">John 14:21-22</a>, “He that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him and will <span class="ital">manifest Myself</span> to him.
