Here, again, He tells them the event before the accomplishment, that it may serve to strengthen their faith. Two interpretations of this verse are possible. (1) That He told them of the coming of the Advocate to teach all truth, and bring all things to their remembrance, in order that in the fulfilment of this they may, with increase of faith, believe in Him. (2) That He told them of His going to the Father, in order that when the hour of departure came they may believe that He had gone to the Father. Upon the whole, and especially considering the close parallel with <a href="/john/13-19.htm" title="Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.">John 13:19</a>, the first seems the more probable meaning.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:28-31 Christ raises the expectations of his disciples to something beyond what they thought was their greatest happiness. His time was now short, he therefore spake largely to them. When we come to be sick, and to die, we may not be capable of talking much to those about us; such good counsel as we have to give, let us give while in health. Observe the prospect Christ had of an approaching conflict, not only with men, but with the powers of darkness. Satan has something in us to perplex us with, for we have all sinned; but when he would disturb Christ, he found nothing sinful to help him. The best evidence of our love to the Father is, our doing as he has commanded us. Let us rejoice in the Saviour's victories over Satan the prince of this world. Let us copy the example of his love and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before it come to pass - Before my death, resurrection, and ascension.<p>Ye might believe - You might be confirmed or strengthened in faith by the evidence which I gave that I came from God - the power of foretelling future events. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father, for my Father is greater than I&#8212;These words, which Arians and Socinians perpetually quote as triumphant evidence against the proper Divinity of Christ, really yield no intelligible sense on their principles. Were a holy man on his deathbed, beholding his friends in tears at the prospect of losing him, to say, "Ye ought rather to joy than weep for me, and would if ye really loved me, "the speech would be quite natural. But if they should ask him, why joy at his departure was more suitable than sorrow, would they not start back with astonishment, if not horror, were he to reply, "Because my Father is greater than I?" Does not this strange speech from Christ's lips, then, presuppose such teaching on His part as would make it extremely difficult for them to think He could gain anything by departing to the Father, and make it necessary for Him to say expressly that there was a sense in which He could do so? Thus, this startling explanation seems plainly intended to correct such misapprehensions as might arise from the emphatic and reiterated teaching of His proper equality with the Father&#8212;as if so Exalted a Person were incapable of any accession by transition from this dismal scene to a cloudless heaven and the very bosom of the Father&#8212;and by assuring them that this was not the case, to make them forget their own sorrow in His approaching joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Evils that surprise us are always the most heavy, and load our spirits. Saith our Saviour, Before these things come to pass, I have given you notice of them, that, when you see them come to pass, you might not be overwhelmed with sorrow and trouble, to the hinderance of your faith in me; but understanding that I have told you the truth before the thing come to pass, you may be assured that I am not mere man, but truly God; and receive and embrace me, and rest upon me as your Saviour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now I have told you before it came to pass,....

Christ often appeals to the effect which the fulfillment of his own predictions will produce in the minds of his disciples (<a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>; <a href="/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>). They will, when the series of events will unroll themselves, believe that he has gone to the Father, to do all he said he would do, to be all he said he was. This means undoubtedly more than a spiritual consolation whereby they may endure his separation by <span class="accented">death</span> from their society. It is the announcement beforehand of the Resurrection and Ascension, by which their faith in his exaltation would be fanned into burning flame and made a revelation of Divine love to the universe. </body></html>
