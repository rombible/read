Upon the word troubled. Be not cast down and disquieted. The word heart. Let your heart be kept with full trust in God. The word your. However others are overwhelmed with the sorrows of this present time, be not you so. Christ's disciples, more than others, should keep their minds quiet, when everything else is unquiet. Here is the remedy against this trouble of mind, Believe. By believing in Christ as the Mediator between God and man, we gain comfort. The happiness of heaven is spoken of as in a father's house. There are many mansions, for there are many sons to be brought to glory. Mansions are lasting dwellings. Christ will be the Finisher of that of which he is the Author or Beginner; if he have prepared the place for us, he will prepare us for it. Christ is the sinner's Way to the Father and to heaven, in his person as God manifest in the flesh, in his atoning sacrifice, and as our Advocate. He is the Truth, as fulfilling all the prophecies of a Saviour; believing which, sinners come by him the Way. He is the Life, by whose life-giving Spirit the dead in sin are quickened. Nor can any man draw nigh God as a Father, who is not quickened by Him as the Life, and taught by Him as the Truth, to come by Him as the Way. By Christ, as the Way, our prayers go to God, and his blessings come to us; this is the Way that leads to rest, the good old Way. He is the Resurrection and the Life. All that saw Christ by faith, saw the Father in Him. In the light of Christ's doctrine, they saw God as the Father of lights; and in Christ's miracles, they saw God as the God of power. The holiness of God shone in the spotless purity of Christ's life. We are to believe the revelation of God to man in Christ; for the works of the Redeemer show forth his own glory, and God in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am in the Father - See the notes at <a href="/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>.<p>The words that I speak ... - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16-17</a>.<p>The Father that dwelleth in me - Literally, "The Father remaining in me." This denotes most intimate union, so that the works which Jesus did might be said to be done by the Father. It implies a more intimate union than can subsist between a mere man and God.

The substance of this passage is that the Son is the ordained and perfect manifestation of the Father, that His own word for this ought to His disciples to be enough; that if any doubts remained His works ought to remove them (see on [1851]Joh 10:37); but yet that these works of His were designed merely to aid weak faith, and would be repeated, nay exceeded, by His disciples, in virtue of the power He would confer on them after His departure. His miracles the apostles wrought, though wholly in His name and by His power, and the "greater" works&#8212;not in degree but in kind&#8212;were the conversion of thousands in a day, by His Spirit accompanying them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</span> It is the opinion of Mr. Calvin, that these words are not here spoken so much to express his Divine nature and being, (for so Christ is no more known to us than his Father), as to express his manner of revealing it. Yet is the Divine nature of Christ fully proved from hence. Others judge, that these words do clearly signify both the distinction of persons, for nothing is in itself, and also the union of the persons in the Divine Being. He proveth his union with the Father, because he spake not those words which he spake of himself; that is, not of himself solely; he revealed but his Father’s will, and declared his Father’s mind; and because the works which he did, he did not by his own sole power, without the concurrence of his Father’s power in those operations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Believest thou not that I am in the Father?....

The first proposition is often arbitrarily supplemented from the second, and <span class="ital">vice versâ</span>.[145] This, however, does not agree with the Greek mode of allowing, in antithetic propositions, one clause to be completed from the other (Kühner, II. p. 603 f.; Bernhardy, p. 455), and would here run counter to the <span class="ital">context</span>, since Jesus, <a href="/john/14-11.htm" title="Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.">John 14:11</a>, desires to have deduced from the <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> that which He had brought into light by <span class="greekheb">τὰ ῥήματα</span> … <span class="greekheb">λαλῶ</span>.

Philip had heard in an inverted order these very words (see <a href="/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>). He might have grasped their meaning; two aspects of the same Divine truth or reality - the reciprocal fellowship between the Father and the Son, between the Father and the Effulgence of the Father's glory who is now the God-Man. I am in the Father, I the God-Man am in the Father, as the Logos has ever been in him and proceeding from him. I, who was forever in the bosom of the Father in heaven though on earth, am in the Father now, as the sun dwells in its own effluent light; and the Father is in me, seeing I am the Image of his substance, the Agent of his purpose, the Speaker of his words, the Doer of his works. The words (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) which I speak (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, R.T.) unto you - those words which are "spirit and life" (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>), those "words of eternal life," according to Peter's grand confession (<a href="/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68, 69</a>) - I do not utter (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>) from myself; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are the words of the Father, and also the proof that I am in the Father, but the Father worketh always and ever more in and through the Son, these works which may seem to be mine as the Son of man, but are the operation of the Father himself, he who abides in the Son. <span class="cmt_word">And the Father abiding in me, doeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">his works.</span> These works of mine (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) are all signs (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of my relation to the Father. They are indications to Philip of the nature, and quality, and character, and feeling towards him of the Father himself. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of myself (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;' &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Rev., better, from myself.

Philip doubts whether Christ is in the Father, and the Father in Him. The answer is twofold, corresponding to the two phases of the doubt. His words, spoken not from Himself, are from the Father, and therefore He utters them from within the Father, and is Himself in the Father. His works are the works of the Father abiding in Him; therefore the Father is in Him. </body></html>
