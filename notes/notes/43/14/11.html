Upon the word troubled. Be not cast down and disquieted. The word heart. Let your heart be kept with full trust in God. The word your. However others are overwhelmed with the sorrows of this present time, be not you so. Christ's disciples, more than others, should keep their minds quiet, when everything else is unquiet. Here is the remedy against this trouble of mind, Believe. By believing in Christ as the Mediator between God and man, we gain comfort. The happiness of heaven is spoken of as in a father's house. There are many mansions, for there are many sons to be brought to glory. Mansions are lasting dwellings. Christ will be the Finisher of that of which he is the Author or Beginner; if he have prepared the place for us, he will prepare us for it. Christ is the sinner's Way to the Father and to heaven, in his person as God manifest in the flesh, in his atoning sacrifice, and as our Advocate. He is the Truth, as fulfilling all the prophecies of a Saviour; believing which, sinners come by him the Way. He is the Life, by whose life-giving Spirit the dead in sin are quickened. Nor can any man draw nigh God as a Father, who is not quickened by Him as the Life, and taught by Him as the Truth, to come by Him as the Way. By Christ, as the Way, our prayers go to God, and his blessings come to us; this is the Way that leads to rest, the good old Way. He is the Resurrection and the Life. All that saw Christ by faith, saw the Father in Him. In the light of Christ's doctrine, they saw God as the Father of lights; and in Christ's miracles, they saw God as the God of power. The holiness of God shone in the spotless purity of Christ's life. We are to believe the revelation of God to man in Christ; for the works of the Redeemer show forth his own glory, and God in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Believe me ... - Believe my declarations that I am in the Father, etc. There were two grounds on which they might believe; one was his own testimony, the other was his works.<p>Or else - If credit is not given to my words, let there be to my miracles.<p>For the very works' sake - On account of the works; or, be convinced by the miracles themselves.

The substance of this passage is that the Son is the ordained and perfect manifestation of the Father, that His own word for this ought to His disciples to be enough; that if any doubts remained His works ought to remove them (see on [1851]Joh 10:37); but yet that these works of His were designed merely to aid weak faith, and would be repeated, nay exceeded, by His disciples, in virtue of the power He would confer on them after His departure. His miracles the apostles wrought, though wholly in His name and by His power, and the "greater" works&#8212;not in degree but in kind&#8212;were the conversion of thousands in a day, by His Spirit accompanying them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Believe my words (for that is your duty); but yet if you will not believe my words, declaring to you my union with my Father, yet when you see me doing such works as none but God can do, believe me for their sake. It is true, that both the prophets and the apostles spake God’s words, not their own, to the people, and also did many great and mighty works; but still their doctrine led unto another, that was Christ; and their miracles were not wrought in their own names, but in the name of Christ. Elijah raised the Shunammite’s dead child to life by prayer to God that he would do it; and the apostles bid the lame man arise and walk, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ’s doctrine terminated in himself; he called men to believe in him, and he wrought miracles by his own power, and by a virtue proceeding out of and from himself, though by the power of his Father also, because he and his Father were one in essence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,....

Some copies read, by way of interrogation, and so the Ethiopic version; and the Vulgate Latin version reads, "believe ye not?" <p>or else believe me for the very work's sake: meaning his miraculous works, such as raising the dead, cleansing the lepers, causing the deaf to hear, and giving sight to the blind; and which were such as none but a divine person could ever perform. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/14-11.htm" title="Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.">John 14:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">πιστεύετέ μοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">πιστεύετε</span>. “Believe me,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, my assertion, not my manifestation, “or if you find that difficult, believe on account of the works themselves”. The mention of His works and the evidence they afford that He is in the Father suggests to Him a ground of comfort for His disciples in view of His departure. And from this point onwards in this chapter it is to the comforting of the disciples our Lord addresses Himself. First, in <a href="/context/john/14-12.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father....">John 14:12-14</a>; second, in <a href="/context/john/14-15.htm" title="If you love me, keep my commandments....">John 14:15-17</a>; third, in <a href="/context/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you....">John 14:18-21</a>.

Philip and addresses all the eleven: ‘believe’ is plural not singular. ‘You have been with Me long enough to believe what I say; but if not, at any rate believe what I do. My words need no credentials: but if credentials are demanded, there are My works.’ He had said the same, somewhat more severely, to the Jews (<a href="/context/john/10-37.htm" title="If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not....">John 10:37-38</a>); and he repeats it much more severely in reference to the Jews (<a href="/john/15-22.htm" title="If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.">John 15:22</a>; <a href="/john/15-24.htm" title="If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.">John 15:24</a>).

My words are spirit and life, and carry their own evidence with them. Christ is not here antithetically contrasting (as Lange suggests) words and works, as though the words were his, and the works the Father's; but he is appealing to their spiritual intuition of truth which is legible by its own light as eternal and Divine, and then reminding them that they may fail in transcendental vision and fall back on reason and its processes, which will come nearer to their understanding - <span class="cmt_word">Or else</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>), if it be after all that you cannot take my words as the Father's words, as the utterance of the Divine thought, <span class="cmt_word">believe me</span> - believe that I am in the Father, etc. - <span class="cmt_word">by reason of the very works</span> which are the witness of the Father's power, holiness, and love. In this last appeal he turns from Philip to the whole group of the apostles. Miracles are, if not primary evidence, secondary and convincing evidence, where the eye has been blinded by the mists of doubt, and the vision of the Father confused and withheld by lack of inward purity. Moreover, by Christ's <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span> are meant, not merely the supernatural portents, but all the work of his life, all the healing of souls, all the conversion of souls, all the indubitable issues of his approach to the heart of man. The great <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is salvation from sin, the gift of righteousness, and the life where before there was moral death (see notes, Vers. 19,20; <a href="/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37, 38</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Believe me (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>The plural of the imperative: "believe ye me."
