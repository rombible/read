The prayer is thought of as addressed to the Father; but the answer here, and still more emphatically in the following verse, is thought of as coming from the Son, who is one with the Father. The width and limitation of the promise are both to be noted. It is “<span class= "ital">whatsoever</span> ye shall ask,” and it is “ask <span class= "ital">in My name</span>.” This means, as My representatives on earth (comp. Notes on previous verse), as persons doing My work, living in My spirit, seeking as I have sought to do the will of the Father. It follows from this that personal petitions are not contemplated here, except as far as they are for the glory of God; and that petitions asked in ignorance may be most truly answered when they are not granted. The prayer of Gethsemane—“If it be possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless, not My will, but Thine be done,” should teach what prayer in the name and spirit of Christ means. We commonly attach to our prayers, “through Jesus Christ our Lord.” We do not always bear in mind that this implies an absolute self-sacrifice, and is a prayer that our very prayers may not be answered except in so far as they are in accordance with the divine will.

To ask in Christ's name, is to plead his merit and intercession, and to depend upon that plea.

He would abide with the disciples to the end of time; his gifts and graces would encourage their hearts. The expressions used here and elsewhere, plainly denote a person, and the office itself includes all the Divine perfections. The gift of the Holy Ghost is bestowed upon the disciples of Christ, and not on the world. This is the favour God bears to his chosen.

This may be referred either to the petition, which must be made with this view, that the Father may be glorified by, or in the Son, in whose name it is put up, and for whose sake it is made; or to Christ's promise to do it; who in doing it, seeks not his own glory, at least not singly; but as the good of his people, so the glory of his heavenly Father. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/john/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/john/14-13.htm" title="And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.">John 14:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο ποιήσω</span>, so what they do is still His doing; one condition being attached to their prayers, that they ask <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου</span>.

Here for the first time our Lord uses these words. Frequently (<a href="/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25</a>) he had spoken of the <span class="accented">Father's Name</span>, and in <a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs; but now he suggests a new and vitalizing condition of prayer. Luthardt has suggested that the believer, being "in Christ," prays to the Father, who is also in Christ. But the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is used here in two entirely distinct senses. Others have said, taking "Name" as the compendium of all his perfections, that asking "in his Name" meant in full recognition of his Person and his relation to them and to the Father. The Name of the Son reveals the Father, and by assuming this most excellent Name, and having its fullness of meaning avouched by the Resurrection and Ascension, the Father was truly manifested. Others, again, urge that Christ's "Name" is equivalent to "himself;" and "in my Name" means "in the full consciousness that he is the element in which prayerful activity lives and moves" (Meyer). Surely this passage is the true justification of prayer to Christ himself, as identically one with the Father (see <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>). "This thing I will do" is strongly in favor of this interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">That the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> The end of this prayer-offering and the Lord's response is that the <span class="accented">Father</span> may be glorified; the Father who has such a Son is thereby glorified in the grateful love of his children, and <span class="accented">in the Son himself</span>, who is seen thus to be the link between him and his other children. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In my name<p>The first occurrence of the phrase. See on <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>. Prayer is made in the name of Jesus, "if this name, Jesus Christ, as the full substance of the saving faith and confession of him who prays, is, in his consciousness, the element in which the prayerful activity moves; so that thus that Name, embracing the whole revelation of redemption, is that which specifically measures and defines the disposition, feeling, object, and contents of prayer. The express use of the name of Jesus therein is no specific token; the question is of the spirit and mind of him who prays" (Meyer). Westcott cites Augustine to the effect that the prayer in Christ's name must be consistent with Christ's character, and that He fulfills it as Savior, and therefore just so far as it conduces to salvation. </body></html>
