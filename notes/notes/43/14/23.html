The thought of God as dwelling in the sanctuary and among the people was familiar to the disciples from the Old Testament Scriptures (see, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/26-11.htm" title="And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm" title="Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the middle of them for ever more.">Ezekiel 37:26</a>), and the thought of the spiritual temple in the heart of man was not unknown to contemporary writers. Philo has a remarkable parallel in his treatise, <span class= "ital">De Cherubim,</span> p. 124, “Since therefore He (God) thus invisibly enters into the region of the soul, let us prepare that place, in the best way the case admits of, to be an abode worthy of God; for if we do not, He, without our being aware of it, will quit us and migrate to some other habitation which shall appear to Him to be more excellently provided” (Bohn’s ed., vol. i., p. 199. See the whole of chap. 29). Schöttgen, in his note, quotes from a Rabbinical writer who says, “Blessed is the man who strives daily to make himself approved unto God, and prepares himself to receive the divine guest.” (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>; and <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:18-24 Christ promises that he would continue his care of his disciples. I will not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily to you at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in the tokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly at the end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shall see him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming; but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. These mysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace, that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ's commands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keep them in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christ is, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens of Christ and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love to Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be a commanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty follows from a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedient believers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in love to them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges are confined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesus leads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the Holy Spirit's new-creating grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will keep my words - See <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>.<p>We will come to him - We will come to him with the manifestation of pardon, peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Spirit. It means that God will manifest himself to the soul as a Father and Friend; that Jesus will manifest himself as a Saviour; that is, that there will be shed abroad in the heart just views and proper feelings toward God and Christ. The Christian will rejoice in the perfections of God and of Christ, and will delight to contemplate the glories of a present Saviour. The condition of a sinner is represented as one who has gone astray from God, and from whom God has withdrawn, <a href="/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-10.htm">Proverbs 28:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-11.htm">Ezekiel 14:11</a>. He is alienated from God, <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>. Religion is represented as God returning to the soul, and manifesting himself as reconciled through Jesus Christ, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>.<p>Make our abode - This is a figurative expression implying that God and Christ would manifest themselves in no temporary way, but that it would be the privilege of Christians to enjoy their presence continually. They would take up their residence in the heart as their dwelling-place, as a temple fit for their abode. See <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; "Ye are the temple of God;" <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost;" <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; "Ye are the temple of the living God." This does not mean that there is any personal union between Christians and God - that there is any special indwelling of the essence of God in us for God is essentially present in all places in the same way; but it is a figurative mode of speaking, denoting that the Christian is under the influence of God; that he rejoices in his presence, and that he has the views, the feelings, the joys which God produces in a redeemed soul, and with which he is pleased. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/john/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. we will come and make our abode with him&#8212;Astonishing statement! In the Father's "coming" He "refers to the revelation of Him as a Father to the soul, which does not take place till the Spirit comes into the heart, teaching it to cry, Abba, Father" [Olshausen]. The "abode" means a permanent, eternal stay! (Compare Le 26:11, 12; Eze 37:26, 27; 2Co 6:16; and contrast Jer 14:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/john/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If any man love Christ, he will keep Christ’s words; that is, he will study and endeavour to keep the commandments of Christ; for if nothing evidenced a true love to Christ but a perfect obedience to his will, none could comfort himself from his obedience, or conclude his love to Christ from it; but he that loveth Christ, will make it his business to be obedient to him in those things first he hath commanded, and are within his power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And my Father will love him; </span> and my Father will manifest his love to him in further dispensations of his grace; for it cannot be understood of God’s eternal love, nor yet of his love in justification and regeneration; for till the man or woman be justified and regenerated, he will never study and endeavour obedience to the will of God. This love of God is the cause, not the effect of our obedience; but <span class="ital">love</span> in this verse must be expounded by manifesting in the former verse; and this is certain, that the <span class="ital">manifestations</span> of Divine love to our souls depend upon our walking with God. This is also meant by God the Father and Christ’s coming to those that love him, and keep his commandments; viz. a coming in the sweet influences of Divine grace, suited to the soul’s various necessities: nay, our Lord promises, not only his and his Father’s coming to, but their making an abode with such as love him, and keep his commandments. Here the abiding of the First and Second Person in the Trinity with believers; the abiding of the Third Person with them is also promised, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a></span>; which all make that presence of God with them, so often promised to them in holy writ. Thus our Saviour answereth one part of what Judas said, <span class="ital">How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us?</span> Because, saith our Saviour, you love me, and keep my words: for though no love, no works of ours, foreseen or seen, be the cause of eternal love, or the first grace; yet it is so much a cause of further grace, especially in the sensible manifestations of it, that no soul must expect it that doth not love Christ, and keep his words. He also further gives them a reason, as to the second thing he asked, why he did not manifest himself to the world? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/john/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus answered and said unto him,.... This answer is returned, and these words are spoken, for the further confirmation and explanation of what was before said: <p>if a man love me, he will keep my words; by his "words" are meant not his doctrines, but his ordinances; the same with his commandments, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>, which he has said, ordered, and commanded to be observed, and which are observed by such who truly love him, and that from a principle of love to him, and with a view to his glory: and for the encouragement of such persons as before, he says, <p>and my Father will love him: which is to be understood not of the love of the Father, as in his own heart, which is not taken up in time, but was in him from all eternity; nor of the first discovery of it to his people, but of greater manifestations of it to them, and a quicker sense of it in their hearts, and also of some other effects of it, to be enjoyed by them in an higher manner; such as larger measures of grace, more communion with him here, and eternal honour and glory hereafter: <p>and we will come unto him: I who am now going away, and my Father to whom I am going, and the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, I have promised to pray for: hence a proof of a plurality of persons in the Godhead, of a trinity of persons, of there being neither more nor fewer than three; since neither more nor less can be collected from the context; and of their distinct personality, or it could not be said with any propriety, "we" each of us "will come unto him"; not locally and visibly, but spiritually, by affording our gracious and comfortable presence, the continuance of which is promised next: <p>and make our abode with him; which denotes habitation; for the saints are the dwelling places or temples of the living God, Father, Son, and Spirit; and the constancy and perpetuity of their residence in them, not as a wayfaring man, but always, though this may not be always discerned by believers; and is a wonderful instance of the grace and condescension of God to dwell on earth with sinful men; and a far greater one it is, than if the most mighty potentate on earth should take up his abode in a poor despicable cottage with the meanest of his subjects. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/john/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/john/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him....">John 14:23-24</a>.

This shews that the revelation cannot be universal, cannot be shared by those who hate and disobey (<a href="/john/15-18.htm" title="If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.">John 15:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my words</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">My</span> <span class="bld">word</span>; the Gospel in its entirety.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we will come</span>] For the use of the plural comp. <a href="/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">abode</span>] See on <span class="ital"><a href="/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

The thought of God dwelling among His people was familiar to every Jew (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-45.htm" title="And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.">Exodus 29:45</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-10.htm" title="Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, see, I come, and I will dwell in the middle of you, said the LORD.">Zechariah 2:10</a>; &c.). This is a thought far beyond that,—God dwelling in the heart of the individual; and later Jewish philosophy had attained to this also. But the united indwelling of the Father and the Son by means of the Spirit is purely Christian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In these two verses (23, 24) the changes ‘words’ … ‘sayings’ … ‘word’ give a wrong impression: they should run—‘word’ … ‘words’ … ‘word.’ In the Greek we have the same substantive, twice n the singular and once in the plural.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/john/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν λόγον μου</span>, <span class="ital">My word</span>) [Not as Engl.

Therefore <span class="ital">to keep His word</span> is a middle term between the love towards Jesus Christ, and the love of the Father towards him who loves Jesus Christ.—<span class="greekheb">ἐλευσόμεθα</span>, <span class="ital">We will come</span>) I and the Father.

In Ver. 21 we see the complementary statement, "He that has and keeps my commandments loves me;" here, "He that loves me keeps my Word." In Ver. 21 obedience proves inward love, and may indicate to the world the fact of the Father's love and my own response. Here our Lord is laying down the principle of relation - the law of close intimacy, the conditions of higher knowledge. The keeping of the Word is a certain consequence of holy love. <span class="cmt_word">And my Father will love him.</span> So far Christ has only reiterated the great statement of Ver. 21, but instead of saying, "I will love him, and manifest myself," he added, <span class="cmt_word">We will come</span> - the Father and I - <span class="cmt_word">to him, and take up our abode</span>, make for ourselves a resting-place <span class="cmt_word">in his dwelling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>); cf. the analogous and wonderful parallel in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>. There is a clear utterance of Divine self-consciousness. It is worthy of note that such an expression as this sounds a profounder depth of that consciousness than any phrase (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) already delivered. Apart from the stupendous corroborative facts elsewhere on record, this seems, to mere human experience, either awfully true or infinitely blasphemous. <span class="accented">The Father add</span> g will come together in the power of the Spirit, and we will dwell within the loving and obedient soul. This phrase suggests the mystical union of the Divine Personality with that of those who have entered into spiritual relation with Christ through love and obedience. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/john/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>My word (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>The entire gospel message, as distinguished from its separate parts or commandments.<p>We will come<p>Compare <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>.<p>Abode (&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2</a>.
