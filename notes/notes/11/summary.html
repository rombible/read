THE BUILDING OF ISRAEL’S FIRST TEMPLE IS THE GOOD NEWS. THE BREAKUP OF ISRAEL’S TWELVE TRIBES IS THE BAD NEWS!<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Concerning the good news: The overseer of this first temple was the world’s wisest man (chapter 3) and one of the richest men who ever lived (chapters 4, 10). Solomon’s reign was the high water mark of Israel’s kingdom in the Old Testament. He controlled more than 60,000 square miles, some ten times the size of David’s dominion. The three Old Testament books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon were written during this time. This temple, begun in 968 B.C., lasted nearly four centuries. It was destroyed by Babylonian monarch Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Concerning the bad news: Solomon’s love for wealth, women, pomp, and power had seriously weakened the fragile unity among the twelve tribes. Upon Solomon’s death, the northern ten split from the southern two in a tragic civil war.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Jeremiah.</b> He was known as the weeping prophet (Jer. 4:19; 9:1, 2, 10; 13:17; 14:17) and authored the longest book in the Bible (apart from the Psalms), the book of Jeremiah.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?
