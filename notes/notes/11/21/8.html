Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience.

Judah's signet and Pharaoh's signet-ring are mentioned in Genesis Gen 38:18; <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>. Signets of Egyptian kings have been found which are referred to about 2000 B.C. Sennacherib's signet, and an impression of Sargon's, are still extant. There can be no doubt that in the East, from a very remote antiquity, kings had seals and appended them to all documents which they set forth under their authority. (Compare also <a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a>; <a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>). The Hebrew mode of sealing seems to have been by attaching a lump of clay to the document, and impressing the seal thereupon <a href="/job/38-14.htm">Job 38:14</a>.<p>His city - i. e., Jezreel <a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1</a>. The mode in which it is spoken of here, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-11.htm">1 Kings 21:11</a>, seems to imply that it was not the city from which Jezebel wrote. The court was evidently at this time residing at Samaria <a href="/1_kings/20-43.htm">1 Kings 20:43</a>; and Ahab may either have met Naboth there, or have gone down (compare <a href="/1_kings/21-16.htm">1 Kings 21:16</a>) to Jezreel to make his request, and then, on being refused, have returned to Samaria.

So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal&#8212;The seal-ring contained the name of the king and gave validity to the documents to which it was affixed (Es 8:8; Da 6:17).

It is evident that, though Ahab had recently been in Jezreel, when he made the offer to Naboth, both he and Jezebel were now in Samaria (1Ki 20:43).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whom she very well knew to be fit for her purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In his city, </span> i.e. in Jezreel.

The letters would be prepared for her by the royal secretaries.

The sequel shews that for such an offence as that charged against Naboth they had the power of life and death. But the whole proceeding is very Oriental. The royal letter dictates the sentence, and how it is to be obtained, and the persons to whom it is addressed make no scruple about obeying, although the last words of this verse increase the enormity of their proceeding by telling that they ‘were in his city, dwelling with Naboth’, and so it would seem well acquainted with his character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words ‘in his city’ are omitted in the LXX.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So she wrote letters</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">writings</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal</span> [The use of the seal, for the purpose of authentication, is of great antiquity.
