Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment, and makes men torment themselves. It is a sin that is its own parent; it arises not from the condition, but from the mind: as we find Paul contented in a prison, so Ahab was discontented in a palace. He had all the delights of Canaan, that pleasant land, at command; the wealth of a kingdom, the pleasures of a court, and the honours and powers of a throne; yet all avails him nothing without Naboth's vineyard. Wrong desires expose men to continual vexations, and those that are disposed to fret, however well off, may always find something or other to fret at.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon his bed - That is, "upon his couch."

It rather shows that so little did he meditate evil that he accepted the refusal of Naboth as conclusive, and gave way to childish grief. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then the disciple of the prophets drew the bandage quickly from his eyes, so that the king recognised him as a prophet, and announced to him the word of the Lord: "Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man of my ban (i.e., Benhadad, who has fallen under my ban), thy life shall stand for his life, and thy people for his people," i.e., the destruction to which Benhadad was devoted will fall upon thee and thy people.
