Jezebel his wife stirred him up to do wickedly. Ahab is reproved, and his sin set before his eyes, by Elijah. That man's condition is very miserable, who has made the word of God his enemy; and very desperate, who reckons the ministers of that word his enemies, because they tell him the truth. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent, yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. Ahab's repentance was only what might be seen of men; it was outward only. Let this encourage all that truly repent, and unfeignedly believe the holy gospel, that if a pretending partial penitent shall go to his house reprieved, doubtless, a sincere believing penitent shall go to his house justified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying - These are not the words of Elijah, but of the writer, who notes a special prophecy against Jezebel, whose guilt was at least equal to her husband's.<p>Wall - The marginal rendering "ditch," is preferable.

This threat was only so far fulfilled upon Ahab, from the compassion of God, and in consequence of his humbling himself under the divine judgment (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27-29</a>), that dogs licked his blood at Samaria when the carriage was washed in which he had died (<a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>); but it was literally fulfilled in the case of his son Joram, whose corpse was cast into Naboth's piece of ground (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25-26</a>). </body></html>
