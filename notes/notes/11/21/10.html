Now, in order to make sure work, the witnesses, as they were instructed, accused Naboth of both those crimes, that the people might be the better satisfied to see him stoned. There is, however, this difference to be observed between these two crimes, that by blaspheming God, a person only forfeited his life, not his estate, which went to his heirs; whereas, when a man was executed for treason, his estate was forfeited to him against whom the offence was committed. For this reason it was that Naboth was charged with this crime also, that his estate might be confiscated, and Ahab might, by that means, get possession of the vineyard. <span class="ital">And then carry him out — </span>Not merely out of the assembly, but out of the city, <a href="/1_kings/21-13.htm" title="And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.

There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience.

Pretending that a heavy guilt lay on one, or some unknown party, who was charged with blaspheming God and the king and that Ahab was threatening vengeance on the whole city unless the culprit were discovered and punished, they assembled the people to observe a solemn fast.

This is the sense everywhere in the O.T. and should have been in the text. In N.T. times ‘Belial’ was personified (see <a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>), but there is no trace of this idea in the earlier Scriptures.

The root idea appears to be ‘to say adieu to’. This might be and most frequently was with a parting benediction; but it also might be a renunciation, a declaration of hostility. Hence the R.V. has put ‘renounce’ in the margin, to indicate how the sense of ‘curse’ is obtained. The verb is used in the bad sense also in <a href="/job/1-5.htm" title="And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.

It is remarkable that an accusation of this nature should have been set afoot by Jezebel. We need not however assume that she had any care about the cursing of God; only that she found this the first convenient mode of getting rid of Naboth. But amongst the people, who were to suppose Naboth justly executed, there must have still been some regard for the divine name and the divine law.

According to some, it is an euphemism, the idea of cursing God being altogether too horrible for the Jew to express in words; whilst others derive this signification from the fact that a curse is really a <span class="accented">prayer</span> addressed to God; and others, again, account for it by the consideration that a person who <span class="accented">bids</span> <span class="accented">farewell</span> to another sometimes does so in the sense of dismissing and cursing him. Anyhow, it is noticeable that the word "blessing" is sometimes used with a similar meaning amongst ourselves] <span class="cmt_word">God and the king</span> [God and the representative of God in Israel are here coupled together, as in <a href="/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>. To curse the king was practically to curse Him whose vicegerent he was (cf. <a href="/matthew/23-18.htm">Matthew 23:18-22</a>).

[The terrible power accorded to "two or three witnesses," of denouncing a man to death, accounts for the prominence given to the sin of bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16</a>).

This childish mode of giving expression to his displeasure at Naboth's refusal to comply with his wish, shows very clearly that Ahab was a man sold under sin (<a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>), who only wanted the requisite energy to display the wickedness of his heart in vigorous action.</body></html>
