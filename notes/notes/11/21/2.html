Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment, and makes men torment themselves. It is a sin that is its own parent; it arises not from the condition, but from the mind: as we find Paul contented in a prison, so Ahab was discontented in a palace. He had all the delights of Canaan, that pleasant land, at command; the wealth of a kingdom, the pleasures of a court, and the honours and powers of a throne; yet all avails him nothing without Naboth's vineyard. Wrong desires expose men to continual vexations, and those that are disposed to fret, however well off, may always find something or other to fret at.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will give thee the worth of it in money - literally, "I will give thee silver, the worth of it."

Naboth Refuses Ahab His Vineyard.<p>1-3. Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel&#8212;Ahab was desirous, from its contiguity to the palace, to possess it for a vegetable garden. He proposed to Naboth to give him a better in exchange, or to obtain it by purchase; but the owner declined to part with it. In persisting in his refusal, Naboth was not actuated by any feelings of disloyalty or disrespect to the king, but solely from a conscientious regard to the divine law, which, for important reasons, had prohibited the sale of a paternal inheritance [Le 25:23; Nu 36:7]; or if, through extreme poverty or debt, an assignation of it to another was unavoidable, the conveyance was made on the condition of its being redeemable at any time [Le 25:25-27]; at all events, of its reverting at the jubilee to the owner [Le 25:28]. In short, it could not be alienated from the family, and it was on this ground that Naboth (1Ki 21:3) refused to comply with the king's demand. It was not, therefore, any rudeness or disrespect that made Ahab heavy and displeased, but his sulky and pettish demeanor betrays a spirit of selfishness that could not brook to be disappointed of a favorite object, and that would have pushed him into lawless tyranny had he possessed any natural force of character.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs,.... For a kitchen garden to produce eatables of the vegetable kind for his household, or for a flower garden; and perhaps for both, as Kimchi observes, it being customary to have such in court yards, or behind the house; perhaps he might take his notion of an herb garden from his neighbours the Syrians, who were very diligent and laborious in cultivating their gardens, as Pliny (z); hence <p>"multa Syrorum olera'', <p>the many herbs of the Syrians, became a proverb with the Greeks: <p>because it is near unto mine house; lay very convenient for him: <p>and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seemeth good unto thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money; which seems very well spoken, that he would either give him a better in exchange, or purchase it at its full value; he did not pretend to take it by usurpation, by force, against his will, as it was represented by Samuel kings would do, <a href="/1_samuel/8-14.htm">1 Samuel 8:14</a> as yet such oppression and tyranny was not exercised. <p>(z) Nat Hist. l. 20. c. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it <i>is</i> near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; <i>or</i>, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</span><p>(a) Though Ahab's tyranny is condemned by the Holy Spirit, yet he was not so rigorous that he would take from another man his right without full recompense.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">that I may have it for a garden of herds</span>] These events must have taken place during a time of peace, when Ahab had leisure to think about the convenient arrangement of his grounds. And it is most probable they occurred after Ben-hadad’s utter defeat, otherwise the victory then granted to Ahab would have been like a condonation of his sin, and not in harmony with the doom pronounced in this chapter (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm" title="And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.">1 Kings 21:19</a>) by Elijah.

The rest may be easily imagined, namely the request to be saved from this punishment.
