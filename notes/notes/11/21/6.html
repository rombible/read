Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon his bed - That is, "upon his couch." The Jews, like other Orientals, reclined upon couches at their meals (<a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>, etc.). Ahab turns his face toward the back of the couch, rejecting all converse with others, and so remains, after the banquet is served, refusing to partake of it. Such an open manifestation of ill temper is thoroughly characteristic of an Oriental king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 21:5-16.

But the narrative is much more in character with the rest of Ahab’s behaviour, if he at first makes mention only of the blank refusal. The ground for holding firm to his inheritance would most likely have found an echo in many an Israelite’s heart. We see that Jezebel gives no hint to any one of the true cause for wishing to put Naboth out of the way. Had she done so, she must have mentioned the reason for his scruple, and the elders of Jezreel though they had forgotten the laws of Jehovah, would, for all that, not have cared to give publicity to Naboth’s answer.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him; Give me thy vineyard for money</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">silver</span>]; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>or else, if it please</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">delight</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">said</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> I will not give thee my vineyard.</span> [Ahab does not mention the reason which Naboth assigned for his refusal.
