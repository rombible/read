Here let us observe, that as obsequious as the elders of Jezreel were to Jezebel’s orders, which she sent from Samaria for the murder of Naboth, so obsequious were the elders of Samaria afterward to Jehu’s orders, which he sent from Jezreel, for the murder of Ahab’s seventy sons, only that was not done by course of lay. “Those tyrants,” says Henry, “that, by their wicked orders, debauch the consciences of their inferior magistrates, may perhaps find at last the wheel return upon them; and that those, who will not stick to do one cruel thing for them, will be as ready, when occasion offers, to do another cruel thing against them.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:5-16 When, instead of a help meet, a man has an agent for Satan, in the form of an artful, unprincipled, yet beloved wife, fatal effects may be expected. Never were more wicked orders given by any prince, than those Jezebel sent to the rulers of Jezreel. Naboth must be murdered under colour of religion. There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has sometimes been made a cover for it. Also, it must be done under colour of justice, and with the formalities of legal process. Let us, from this sad story, be amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of Satan in the children of disobedience. Let us commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for innocence will not always be our security; and let us rejoice in the knowledge that all will be set to rights in the great day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Naboth had sons who were also put to death at this time (marginal reference). It is not improbable that they were stoned together with their parent (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>).

Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession&#8212;Naboth's execution having been announced, and his family being involved in the same fatal sentence (2Ki 9:26), his property became forfeited to the crown, not by law, but traditionary usage (see 2Sa 16:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They sent to Jezebel; </span> by whom they knew the affairs of the kingdom were managed, and this design contrived. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. Not only stoned, but stoned to death. This message was sent to her from the magistrates of Jezreel; for though the letters came in Ahab's name, they might be privately informed that this was a scheme of Jezebel's; besides, they knew she had the sway at court, and especially that the news of this man's death would be acceptable to her, and the more if he was of the 7000 that would not bow the knee to Baal. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they sent to Jezebel</span> [clearly she was not at Jezreel], <span class="cmt_word">saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</span> [Stanley observes that it is significant that this announcement was made to her and not to Ahab.

The letter ran thus: "Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people, and set two worthless men opposite to him, that they may give evidence against him: Thou hast blasphemed God and king; and lead him out and stone him, that he may die." Jezebel ordered the fasting for a sign, as though some public crime or heavy load of guilt rested upon the city, for which it was necessary that it should humble itself before God (<a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>). The intention was, that at the very outset the appearance of justice should be given to the legal process about to be instituted in the eyes of all the citizens, and the stamp of veracity impressed upon the crime of which Naboth was to be accused. &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;...&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, "seat him at the head of the people," i.e., bring him to the court of justice as a defendant before all the people. The expression may be explained from the fact, that a sitting of the elders was appointed for judicial business, in which Naboth and the witnesses who were to accuse him of blasphemy took part seated. To preserve the appearance of justice, two witnesses were appointed, according to the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6-7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>; but worthless men, as at the trial of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, to bless God, i.e., to bid Him farewell, to dismiss Him, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>, equivalent to blaspheming God. God and king are mentioned together, like God and prince in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-27.htm">Exodus 22:27</a>, to make it possible to accuse Naboth of transgressing this law, and to put him to death as a blasphemer of God, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>, where the punishment of stoning is awarded to idolatry as a practical denial of God. Blaspheming the king is not to be taken as a second crime to be added to the blasphemy of God; but blaspheming the king, as the visible representative of God, was eo ipso also blaspheming God.</body></html>
