See what they get that join with wicked men. How can it be expected that he should be true to his friend, who has been false to his God! He had said in compliment to Ahab, I am as thou art, and now he was indeed taken for him. Those that associate with evil-doers, are in danger of sharing in their plagues. By Jehoshaphat's deliverance, God let him know, that though he was displeased with him, yet he had not deserted him. God is a friend that will not fail us when other friends do. Let no man think to hide himself from God's judgment. God directed the arrow to hit Ahab; those cannot escape with life, whom God has doomed to death. Ahab lived long enough to see part of Micaiah's prophecy accomplished. He had time to feel himself die; with what horror must he have thought upon the wickedness he had committed!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Commanded - "Had commanded." Ben-hadad delivers his order in the hyperbolical style common in the East. His meaning is, "Make it your chief object to kill or take the king of Israel." Apparently, his own defeat and captivity were still rankling in his mind, and he wished to retaliate on Ahab, the humiliation which he considered himself to have suffered. He shows small appreciation of the generosity which had spared his life and restored him to his kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-38. went up to Ramoth-gilead&#8212;The king of Israel, bent on this expedition, marched, accompanied by his ally, with all his forces to the siege; but on approaching the scene of action, his courage failed, and, hoping to evade the force of Micaiah's prophecy by a secret stratagem, he assumed the uniform of a subaltern, while he advised Jehoshaphat to fight in his royal attire. The Syrian king, with a view either to put the speediest end to the war, or perhaps to wipe out the stain of his own humiliation (1Ki 20:31), had given special instructions to his generals to single out Ahab, and to take or kill him, as the author of the war. The officers at first directed their assault on Jehoshaphat, but, becoming aware of their mistake, desisted. Ahab was wounded by a random arrow, which, being probably poisoned, and the state of the weather increasing the virulence of the poison, he died at sunset. The corpse was conveyed to Samaria; and, as the chariot which brought it was being washed, in a pool near the city, from the blood that had profusely oozed from the wound, the dogs, in conformity with Elijah's prophecy, came and licked it [1Ki 21:19].

The changes are as usual to conform to 2 Chronicles. These thirty-two captains were most likely those who had been chosen to supply the places of the thirty-two kings that were removed in the campaign of three years before (<a href="/1_kings/20-24.htm" title="And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:">1 Kings 20:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that had rule over his chariots</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">of his chariots</span>.

[This Orientalism, translated into Western ideas, means, "Direct your weapons against the king." What Ahab had done to provoke such resentment is not quite clear. Rawlinson supposes that Ben-hadad's "defeat and captivity were still rankling in his mind, and he wished to retaliate on Ahab the humiliation which he considered himself to have suffered." But it is impossible to see in Ahab's generous conduct towards him a sufficient reason for the fierce hatred which these words disclose. It is much more probable that some affront had subsequently been offered to the Syrian monarch, possibly in the shape of the reproaches which Ahab may have addressed to him on account of his retention of Ramoth-Gilead, and the gross violation of the treaty of <a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>. It is also possible that he hoped that the death of Ahab would terminate the war (Bahr).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Micah was not led astray, however, by this, but disclosed to him by a further revelation the hidden ground of the false prophecy of his 400 prophets. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, "therefore, sc. because thou thinkest so, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw the Lord sit upon His throne, and all the army of heaven stand around him (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>, etc.) on His right hand and on His left. And the Lord said, Who will persuade Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth in Gilead? and one spake so, the other so; and the spirit came forth (from the ranks of the rest), stood before Jehovah, and said, I will persuade him...I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He (Jehovah) said, Persuade, and thou wilt also be able; go forth and do so. And now Jehovah has put a lying spirit into the mouth of all his prophets; but Jehovah (Himself) has spoken evil (through me) concerning thee." The vision described by Micah was not merely a subjective drapery introduced by the prophet, but a simple communication of the real inward vision by which the fact had been revealed to him, that the prophecy of those 400 prophets was inspired by a lying spirit. The spirit (&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;) which inspired these prophets as a lying spirit is neither Satan, nor any evil spirit whatever, but, as the definite article and the whole of the context show, the personified spirit of prophecy, which is only so far a &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; (<a href="/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-6.htm">1 John 4:6</a>) and under the influence of Satan as it works as &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; in accordance with the will of God. For even the predictions of the false prophets, as we may see from the passage before us, and also from <a href="/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a> and the scriptural teaching in other passages concerning the spiritual principle of evil, were not mere inventions of human reason and fancy; but the false prophets as well as the true were governed by a supernatural spiritual principle, and, according to divine appointment, were under the influence of the evil spirit in the service of falsehood, just as the true prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit in the service of the Lord. The manner in which the supernatural influence of the lying spirit upon the false prophets is brought out in Micah's vision is, that the spirit of prophecy (&#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1492;&#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;) offers itself to deceive Ahab as &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; in the false prophets. Jehovah sends this spirit, inasmuch as the deception of Ahab has been inflicted upon him as a judgment of God for his unbelief. But there is no statement here to the effect that this lying spirit proceeded from Satan, because the object of the prophet was simply to bring out the working of God in the deception practised upon Ahab by his prophets. - The words of Jehovah, "Persuade Ahab, thou wilt be able," and "Jehovah has put a lying spirit," etc., are not to be understood as merely expressing the permission of God, as the fathers and the earlier theologians suppose. According to the Scriptures, God does work evil, but without therefore willing it and bringing forth sin. The prophet's view is founded upon this thought: Jehovah has ordained that Ahab, being led astray by a prediction of his prophets inspired by the spirit of lies, shall enter upon the war, that he may find therein the punishment of his ungodliness. As he would not listen to the word of the Lord in the mouth of His true servants, God had given him up (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>, <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>) in his unbelief to the working of the spirits of lying. But that this did not destroy the freedom of the human will is evident from the expression &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, "thou canst persuade him," and still more clearly from &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, "thou wilt also be able," since they both presuppose the possibility of resistance to temptation on the part of man.<p>Zedekiah was so enraged at this unveiling of the spirit of lying by which the pseudo-prophets were impelled, that he smote Micah upon the cheek, and said (<a href="/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>): "Where did the Spirit of Jehovah depart from me, to speak to thee?" To &#1488;&#1497;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492; the Chronicles add as an explanation, &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;: "by what way had he gone from me?" (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>, and Ewald, 326, a.) Zedekiah was conscious that he had not invented his prophecy himself, and therefore it was that he rose up with such audacity against Micah; but he only proved that it was not the Spirit of God which inspired him. If he had been inspired by the Spirit of the Lord, he would not have thought it necessary to try and give effect to his words by rude force, but he would have left the defence of his cause quietly to the Lord, as Micah did, who calmly replied to the zealot thus (<a href="/1_kings/22-25.htm">1 Kings 22:25</a>): "Thou wilt see it (that the Spirit of Jehovah had departed from thee) on the day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself" (&#1492;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1495;&#1489;&#1488;, see Ges. 75, Anm. 21). This was probably fulfilled at the close of the war, when Jezebel or the friends of Ahab made the pseudo-prophets suffer for the calamitous result; although there is nothing said about this in our history, which confines itself to the main facts.</body></html>
