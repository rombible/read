The natural result is a mingled awe and contempt, such as Balak feels for Balaam. The delusion is, of course, silenced at once by such declarations as the stern reply of Micaiah, which even Balaam could convey (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm" title="And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.">Numbers 22:18</a>). But, as all false religions and corruptions of true religion show, it is never rooted out, except by real spiritual knowledge of God and of His dealings with the soul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/22-13.htm" title="And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good....">1 Kings 22:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Speak that which is good — </span>This was a most absurd request: for if Micaiah was a true prophet, he could say nothing but what was suggested to him by divine inspiration, and if he were not, why should he speak at all?

They will be drawn to wink at and countenance such conduct and conversation as they ought to protest against with abhorrence. Whithersoever a good man goes, he ought to take his religion with him, and not be ashamed to own it when he is with those who have no regard for it. Jehoshaphat had not left behind him, at Jerusalem, his affection and reverence for the word of the Lord, but avowed it, and endeavoured to bring it into Ahab's court. And Ahab's prophets, to please Jehoshaphat, made use of the name of Jehovah: to please Ahab, they said, Go up. But the false prophets cannot so mimic the true, but that he who has spiritual senses exercised, can discern the fallacy. One faithful prophet of the Lord was worth them all. Wordly men have in all ages been alike absurd in their views of religion. They would have the preacher fit his doctrine to the fashion of the times, and the taste of the hearers, and yet to add. Thus saith the Lord, to words that men would put into their mouths. They are ready to cry out against a man as rude and foolish, who scruples thus to try to secure his own interests, and to deceive others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the messenger spake unto him ... - There seems to have been a widespread notion among the irreligious and the half-religious of the ancient world, that their prophets were not the mere mouth-pieces of the god, but that they were persons who had power with the god, and could compel, or at least induce, Him to work their will (compare <a href="/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>).

Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron&#8212;Small projections, of the size and form of our candle extinguishers (worn in many parts of the East as military ornaments), were worn by the Syrians of that time, and probably by the Israelite warriors also. Zedekiah, by assuming two horns, personated two heroes, and, pretending to be a prophet, wished in this manner to represent the kings of Israel and Judah in a military triumph.

For Jehoshaphat did not recognise them as genuine prophets of Jehovah, but inquired whether there was not such a prophet still in existence (<a href="/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>), that they might inquire the will of the Lord of him (&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;).</body></html>
