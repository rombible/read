Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There shalt not an hair ... - This was a proverbial expression, meaning "he shall suffer no hurt at all." Solomon's clemency in pardoning Adonijah is very remarkable. In the East not only are pretenders almost always punished with death, but it has often been the custom for each king upon his accession to put to death all his brothers as mere possible pretenders. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53. they brought him down from the altar&#8212;from the ledge around the altar on which he was standing.<p>he bowed himself&#8212;that is, did homage to Solomon as king.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Lead a private or retired and quiet life, without noise and numerous attendants, and meddle not with the affairs of the court and kingdom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So King Solomon sent, and they brought down Adonijah from the altar,....

So Adonijah did homage to Solomon as his lord; and by pardoning the chief offender the new king shewed the rest of Adonijah’s adherents that they need not despair of forgiveness. Thus he would be most likely to change them from foes to friends.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So King Solomon sent and they brought him down</span> [The altar was elevated: probably a slope, not steps (<a href="/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>) led to it] <span class="cmt_word">from</span> [Hebrew <span class="accented">from upon.</span> He was still clinging to it] <span class="cmt_word">the altar.

The repetition of &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; three times (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-46.htm">1 Kings 1:46-48</a>) gives emphasis to the words, since every new point which is introduced with &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; raises the thing higher and higher towards absolute certainty. The fact related in <a href="/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a> refers to the words of Benaiah in <a href="/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a> and <a href="/1_kings/1-37.htm">1 Kings 1:37</a>. The Chethib &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; is the correct reading, and the Keri &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; an unnecessary emendation. The prayer to God, with thanksgiving for the favour granted to him, was offered by David after the return of his anointed son Solomon to the royal palace; so that it ought strictly to have been mentioned after <a href="/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>. The worship of grey-headed David upon the bed recalls to mind the worship of the patriarch Jacob after making known his last will (<a href="/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a>). </body></html>
