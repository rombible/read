David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor.

There appears to be an undertone of reproof in these words. Nathan assumes that Adonijah cannot have done all this without David's knowledge and sanction, because "his father had not displeased him at any time" (ver. 6).

The plural shows that other  high officers had followed his lead. "Under the captains of the host (ver. 25), the servants of the king (ver. 10) are included" (Bahr). Bahr's accidental miscitation (ver. 10 for ver. 9) has apparently led his American translator (p. 24) to the serious mistake of identifying these "captains of the host" with "the mighty men" (Gibborim) of ver. 10, who, it is distinctly said, "were not with Adonijah] <span class="cmt_word">and Abtathar the priest, and behold, they eat and drink before him</span> [<span class="accented">convivia apta conjurationibus.</span> Grotius] <span class="cmt_word">and say, God save king Adonijah.</span> [Hebrews "let the king (not "king," as marg.)

This was the customary acclamation wherewith the Jews greeted their kings (cf. ver. 39; <a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-16.htm">2 Samuel 16:16</a>: <a href="/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-11.htm">2 Chronicles 23:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Bathsheba followed this advice, and went to the king into the inner chamber (&#1492;&#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1492;), since the very aged king, who was waited upon by Abishag, could not leave his room (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1514;; cf. Ewald, 188, b., p. 490), and, bowing low before him, communicated to him what Adonijah had taken in hand in opposition to his will and without his knowledge. The second &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is not to be altered into &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, inasmuch as it is supported by the oldest codices and the Masora,<p>(Note: Kimchi says: "Plures scribae errant in hoc verbo, scribentes &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; cum Aleph, quia sensui hoc conformius est; sed constat nobis ex correctis MSS et masora, scribendum esse &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492; cum Ain." Hence both Norzi and Bruns have taken &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1492; under their protection.Compare de Rossi, variae lectt. ad h. l.)<p>although about two hundred codd. contain the latter reading. The repetition of &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; ("And now, behold, Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord king, thou knowest it not") may be explained from the energy with which Bathsheba speaks. "And Solomon thy servant he hath not invited" (<a href="/1_kings/1-19.htm">1 Kings 1:19</a>). Bathsheba added this, not because she felt herself injured, but as a sign of Adonijah's feelings towards Solomon, which showed that he had reason to fear the worst if Adonijah should succeed in his usurpation of the throne. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-20.htm">1 Kings 1:20</a>, again, many codd. have &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in the place of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;; and Thenius, after his usual fashion, pronounces the former the "only correct" reading, because it is apparently a better one. But here also the appearance is deceptive. The antithesis to what Adonijah has already done is brought out quite suitably by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;: Adonijah has made himself king, etc.; but thou my lord king must decide in the matter. "The eyes of all Israel are turned towards thee, to tell them who (whether Adonijah or Solomon) is to sit upon the throne after thee." "The decision of this question is in thy hand, for the people have not yet attached themselves to Adonijah, but are looking to thee, to see what thou wilt do; and they will follow thy judgment, if thou only hastenest to make Solomon king." - Seb. Schmidt. To secure this decision, Bathsheba refers again, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-21.htm">1 Kings 1:21</a>, to the fate which would await both herself and her son Solomon after the death of the king. They would be &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., guilty of a capital crime. "We should be punished as though guilty of high treason" (Clericus).</body></html>
