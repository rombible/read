Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king bowed himself - The king worshipped God and prayed that it might be so.

The arrival of a trusty messenger, who gave a full detail of the coronation ceremony [1Ki 1:43-48], spread dismay in their camp. The wicked and ambitious plot they had assembled to execute was dissipated, and every one of the conspirators consulted his safety by flight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To bless our lord king David; </span> to praise and thank him for his great and good care, in leaving them in the hands of so excellent a successor, under whom they might expect peace and all prosperity; and to congratulate with him for God’s great mercy to him, in giving him such a son and successor, and that his eyes had now seen the actual accomplishment of God’s promise made to him concerning this thing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The king bowed himself upon the bed; </span> adoring God for this great mercy, and thereby declaring his hearty approbation and consent to this action.

To give him thanks for the wise and good provision he had made before his death for the welfare of the kingdom, by making Solomon his son king in his stead, and to congratulate him upon it; which showed that they highly approved of it, and were ready to swear allegiance to Solomon, and therefore Adonijah had nothing to hope for from them: <p>saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name; that is, may he be more famous, and his name be more celebrated in the world than his was, or be more respectable and valued among his people Israel: <p>and make his throne greater than thy throne; see <a href="/1_kings/1-37.htm">1 Kings 1:37</a>; <p>and the king bowed himself upon the bed; signifying not only his approbation of what was done, but also of their prayers and wishes; as well as he bowed himself to give thanks to God that he had lived to see this work done, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne.

He prayed that the good wishes he had just heard might be fulfilled, and thanked God for what had already happened. The action and intention is similar to that of Jacob described <a href="/genesis/47-31.htm" title="And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him.

The music, therefore, and the joyful acclamations of the people must have been heard as far off as the fountain of Rogel. When Joab observed the sound of the trumpet, knowing what these tones must signify, he asked "wherefore the sound of the city in an uproar" (i.e., what does it mean)? At that moment Jonathan the son of Abiathar arrived (see <a href="/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>.). Adonijah called out to him: "Come, for thou art a brave man and bringest good tidings;' suppressing all anxiety with these words, as he knew his father's will with regard to the succession to the throne, and the powerful and influential friends of Solomon (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-19.htm">1 Kings 1:19</a>, <a href="/1_kings/1-26.htm">1 Kings 1:26</a>). </body></html>
