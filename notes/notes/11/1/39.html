Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tabernacle - Probably that which David had made for the ark of the covenant on Mount Zion <a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>.

The ‘holy anointing oil’ was no doubt preserved for occasions like this, and for the anointing of the priests.

And as Gibeon was ‘the great high place’ (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1 Kings 3:4</a>), all that was most sacred would be kept there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">out of the tabernacle</span>] The word here rendered ‘tabernacle’ is not the same as that so rendered in the passage from 1 Chron. just quoted, and it is advisable to make a distinction between them. The word in this verse is that usually translated, when it does not refer to the sacred dwellingplace of God’s glory, by the English ‘tent’ (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm" title="And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.">Genesis 9:21</a> &c.) and it would be well so to render here. In no other passage in Scripture does the word occur of the Divine dwellingplace without some qualifying expression added to it. It is ‘the tabernacle of the congregation,’ ‘the tabernacle of witness,’ ‘the tabernacle of the Lord.’ In all these cases ‘<span class="bld">Tent</span>’ might well be substituted. This word refers to the external covering of black goats’ hair, while the other word implies the interior, the very dwellingplace of God, and for this ‘Tabernacle’ might be specially retained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the people said</span>] Solomon’s anointing was made a public ceremonial, news of what was to be done would go forth during the time that a messenger went to Gibeon for the sacred oil, and thus there seems to have been present not only those whom David had commissioned but a large body of the people of Jerusalem.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil</span> [Hebrews the oil.

The servants of your lord (&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;) are the Crethi and Plethi, and not the Gibborim also (Thenius), as <a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a> clearly shows, where we find that these alone went down with him to Gihon as the royal body-guard. &#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, upon the mule which belongs to me, i.e., upon my (the king's) mule. When the king let any one ride upon the animal on which he generally rode himself, this was a sign that he was his successor upon the throne. Among the ancient Persians riding upon the king's horse was a public honour, which the king conferred upon persons of great merit in the eyes of all the people (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8-9</a>). &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, the female mule, which in Kahira is still preferred to the male for riding (see Rosenmller, bibl. Althk. iv. 2, p. 56). Gihon (&#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;) was the name given, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>, to a spring on the western side of Zion, which supplied two basins or pools, viz., the upper watercourse of Gihon (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>) or upper pool (<a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>), and the lower pool (<a href="/isaiah/22-9.htm">Isaiah 22:9</a>). The upper Gihon still exists as a large reservoir built up with hewn stones, though somewhat fallen to decay, which is called by the monks Gihon, by the natives Birket el Mamilla, about 700 yards W.N.W. from the Joppa gate, in the basin which opens into the valley of Hinnom. The lower pool is probably the present Birket es Sultan, on the south-western side of Zion (see Robinson, Palestine, i. p. 485ff., 512ff., and Biblical Researches, p. 142ff.). The valley between the two was certainly the place where Solomon was anointed, as it is not stated that this took place at the fountain of Gihon. And even the expression &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500; &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; (take him down to Gihon) agrees with this. For is you go from Zion to Gihon towards the west, you first of all have to descend a slope, and then ascend by a gradual rise; and this slope was probably a more considerable one in ancient times (Rob. Pal. i. p. 514, note).<p>(Note: The conjecture of Thenius, that &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503; should be altered into &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, is hardly worth mentioning; for, apart from the fact that all the ancient versions confirm the correctness of &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;, the objections which Thenius brings against it amount to mere conjectures or groundless assumptions, such as that Zadok took the oil-horn out of the tabernacle at Gibeon, which is not stated in v. 39. Moreover, Gibeon was a three hours' journey from Jerusalem, so that it would have been absolutely impossible for the anointing, which was not commanded by David till after Adonijah's feast had commenced, to be finished so quickly that the procession could return to Jerusalem before it was ended, as is distinctly recorded in v. 41.) </body></html>
