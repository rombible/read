He stands out in consistent portraiture throughout, as a bold, hard, and unscrupulous man; in his relations to the king often imperious and disobedient; but nevertheless an absolutely loyal servant, to whom, in great degree, the establishment of David’s throne was due, and who, moreover (as is shown by his remonstrance against the numbering of the people, recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/24-3.htm" title="And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD your God add to the people, how many soever they be, an hundred times, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?">2Samuel 24:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?">1Chronicles 21:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-6.htm" title="But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.">1Chronicles 21:6</a>), was not without some right instincts of policy and of duty to God.<p><span class= "bld">Abiathar the priest</span>.—Of Abiathar we also know that he had been the companion of all David’s adversity, and of his reign at Hebron (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm" title="And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.">1Samuel 22:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.">1Samuel 23:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1Samuel 30:7</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.">2Samuel 2:1-4</a>); that he was in-installed (with Zadok) as high priest at Jerusalem, and remained faithful to David in the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm" title="And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;">2Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/15-24.htm" title="And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.">2Samuel 15:24-29</a>).<p>The adhesion of these two faithful servants of David, as also of “the king’s sons,” and “the men of Judah, the king’s servants,” to the rash usurpation of Adonijah, seems strange at first sight. Probably Joab had never recovered his position in the king’s favour since the death of Absalom; and it is possible that the evident growth of despotic power and state in David’s latter years may have alienated from him the trusty friends of earlier and simpler days. But the true explanation would seem to be, that the attempt of Adonijah was not viewed as an actual rebellion. Solomon was young; David’s designation of him for the succession might be represented as the favouritism of dotage; and the assumption of the crown by the eldest son, a man in the prime of life and of popular qualities, might seem not only justifiable, but even right and expedient.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 Indulgent parents are often chastised with disobedient children, who are anxious to possess their estates.

So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.">1 Chronicles 11:6</a>), and served David faithfully in the main until this time. But he held David’s secret in the matter of Uriah, and accordingly defied him, when it suited his purpose. His greatest offence against the king was the slaughter of Absalom, whom he killed in defiance of David’s order. (<a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm" title="Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you.

He must have known that he was under David's displeasure, and he must have feared, too, that he would be an object of dislike and distrust to a successor trained, as Solomon had been, under David's and Nathan's immediate influence. He could hardly be unconscious that under a new reign his position - unless he took measures to assure it - would be a precarious one. He resolved, therefore, to secure himself by helping Adonijah to his throne. It is also highly probable that Adonijah's ambitious character was much more to his liking than that of the pious and pacific Solomon. Adonijah's physical qualities, again, would no doubt commend him to this rough soldier, who may also have sympathised with him as the eldest son.

An obvious transposition] <span class="cmt_word">the priest.</span> ["Abiathar's defection is still more surprising" than Joab's (Rawlinson). It is certainly remarkable, when we consider the close ties which subsisted between Abiathar and David, ties which were cemented by the blood of eighty-five persons (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>), and strengthened by the many afflictions which they had shared in common (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 23 to 1 Kings 28; <a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>), that he should have joined in a plot to defeat David's cherished hopes and plans - plans, too, which he must surely have known, had the sanction of religion (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>), and there must have been some powerful motive to account for this. May we not find one in jealousy of Zadok, who had for some time been associated with him in the priesthood, who is generally mentioned first (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-29.htm">2 Samuel 15:29, 35, 36</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). as if he were the more important and influential, and whose advancement, after the prophecy of <a href="/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33-36</a>, Abiathar could not contemplate without suspicion and dread. Is it not highly probable that among the "words" Adonijah had with him was a promise to restore the priesthood to his family exclusively, as the reward of his allegiance]: <span class="cmt_word">and they following Adonijah helped him</span> (lit., as marg., "helped after Adonijah." It is a pregnant construction, "they aided having followed the side of Adonijah" (Gesenius). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When king David had become so old that they could no longer warm him by covering him with clothes, his servants advised him to increase his vitality by lying with a young and robust virgin, and selected the beautiful Abishag of Shunem to perform this service. This circumstance, which is a trivial one in itself, is only mentioned on account of what follows - first, because it shows that David had become too weak from age, and too destitute of energy, to be able to carry on the government any longer; and, secondly, because Adonijah the pretender afterwards forfeited his life through asking for Abishag in marriage. - The opening of our book, &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; (and the King), may be explained from the fact that the account which follows has been taken from a writing containing the earlier history of David, and that the author of these books retained the Vav cop. which he found there, for the purpose of showing at the outset that his work was a continuation of the books of Samuel. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; &#1494;&#1511;&#1503; as in <a href="/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-1.htm">Genesis 24:1</a>, etc. "They covered him with clothes, and he did not get warm." It follows from this that the king was bedridden, or at least that when lying down he could no longer be kept warm with bed-clothes. &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean clothes to wear here, but large cloths, which were used as bed-clothes, as in <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a> and <a href="/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6</a>. &#1497;&#1495;&#1501; is used impersonally, and derived from &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;, cf. Ewald, 193, b., and 138, b. As David was then in his seventieth year, this decrepitude was not the natural result of extreme old age, but the consequence of a sickly constitution, arising out of the hardships which he had endured in his agitated and restless life. The proposal of his servants, to restore the vital warmth which he had lost by bringing a virgin to lie with him, is recommended as an experiment by Galen (Method. medic. viii. 7). And it has been an acknowledged fact with physicians of all ages, that departing vitality may be preserved and strengthened by communicating the vital warmth of strong and youthful persons (compare Trusen, Sitten Gebruche u. Krankheiten der Hebrer, p. 257ff.). The singular suffix in &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; is to be explained on the ground that one person spoke. &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, a maid who is a virgin. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, to stand before a person as servant  equals  to serve (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a> with <a href="/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>). &#1505;&#1499;&#1504;&#1514;, an attendant or nurse, from &#1505;&#1499;&#1503;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, to live with a person, then to be helpful or useful to him. With the words "that she may lie in thy bosom," the passage passes, as is frequently the case, from the third person to a direct address. </body></html>
