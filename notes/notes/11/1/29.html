David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor.

To his former oath, he added another for greater confirmation: <p>and said, as the Lord liveth; which was the proper form of an oath, which ought to be taken by the living God; and as what would lay him under the greater obligation to observe it, he adds, <p>that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress; saved his life when in the most imminent danger; delivered him out of the hand of Goliath, and from the Philistines and other enemies, in his wars with them; and from Saul and his persecuting rage and fury, and from the rebellion of his son Absalom, and the insurrection of Sheba. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">And the king sware</span>] i.e. Solemnly renewed the oath which he had before (see <a href="/1_kings/1-13.htm" title="Go and get you in to king David, and say to him, Did not you, my lord, O king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?">1 Kings 1:13</a>) made unto Bath-sheba.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As <span class="ital">the Lord liveth</span>] The expression is equivalent to ‘As surely as the Lord liveth,’ though in the Hebrew there is no word for <span class="ital">as</span>.

And it is not without reason that he thinks of the termination of his distresses in connexion with Solomon, for the birth of that son marked the time when he became at peace not only with men but with God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king sware</span> [see on ver., 51] <span class="cmt_word">and said, As the Lord liveth</span> [or "by the life of Jehovah."

Similar expressions are found in <a href="/psalms/25-22.htm">Psalm 25:22</a>, and Psalm 34:22. The repeated deliverance out of straits and danger - "out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul" - was one of the most remarkable features of David's life, and it is no wonder that he repeatedly commemorates it, converting every adjuration into an act of thanksgiving.

When he was announced to the king, Bathsheba retired, just as afterwards Nathan went away when the king had Bathsheba called in again (cf. <a href="/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28</a> with <a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32</a>). This was done, not to avoid the appearance of a mutual arrangement (Cler., Then., etc.), but for reasons of propriety, inasmuch as, in audiences granted by the king to his wife or one of his counsellors, no third person ought to be present unless the king required his attendance. Nathan confirmed Bathsheba's statement, commencing thus: "My lord king, thou hast really said, Adonijah shall be king after me...? for he has gone down to-day, and has prepared a feast, ... and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, Long live king Adonijah!" And he then closed by asking, "Has this taken place on the part of my lord the king, and thou hast not shown thy servants (Nathan, Zadok, Benaiah, and Solomon) who is to sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him?" The indirect question introduced with &#1488;&#1501; is not merely an expression of modesty, but also of doubt, whether what had occurred had emanated from the king and he had not shown it to his servants.</body></html>
