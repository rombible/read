Large blocks of stone always attract attention in the East, and receive names which are often drawn from some trivial circumstance.

En-rogel&#8212;situated (Jos 15:7-10) east of Jerusalem, in a level place, just below the junction of the valley of Hinnom with that of Jehoshaphat. It is a very deep well, measuring one hundred twenty-five feet in depth; the water is sweet, but not very cold, and it is at times quite full to overflowing. The Orientals are fond of enjoying festive repasts in the open air at places which command the advantage of shade, water, and verdure; and those fetes champetres are not cold collations, but magnificent entertainments, the animals being killed and dressed on the spot. Adonijah's feast at En-rogel was one of this Oriental description, and it was on a large scale (2Sa 3:4, 5; 5:14-16; 1Ch 14:1-7). At the accession of a new king there were sacrifices offered (1Sa 11:15). But on such an occasion it was no less customary to entertain the grandees of the kingdom and even the populace in a public manner (1Ch 12:23-40). There is the strongest probability that Adonijah's feast was purely political, to court popularity and secure a party to support his claim to the crown.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Because he knew they favoured Solomon his competitor. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.

But in those early times in most countries but especially in the East the right of hereditary succession was not thought of, the reigning monarch selecting for his successor that member of his family who was most in favour or who seemed most fit to rule. Moreover, in this case, Solomon was not the son of the first wife.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">called</span>] i.e. invited to be present at the feast which he was about to make.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</span> [It is clear from this verse that Adonijah perfectly understood that he had in Solomon a rival. The intentions and promises (ver. 13) of his father can hardly have been unknown to him. The name "Jedidiah, too, bestowed upon Solomon by Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>), taken in connexion with the prophecy of Nathan (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 2 Samuel 7:12; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9, 10</a>), must have proved to him that Solomon was marked out for David's successor. He seems to have been well aware also who were Solomon's supporters. To some of them he may have made indirect overtures. The historian having recorded Adonijah's preparations for a <span class="accented">coup d'etat</span>, now relates the manner in which the plot was frustrated. The prophet, who had been the guardian and preceptor of Solomon's youth, and who knew the Divine will respecting the succession (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9, 10</a>), takes prompt and energetic measures to defeat the conspiracy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They then looked about for a beautiful girl for this purpose, and found Abishag of Shunem, the present Sulem or Solam, at the south-eastern foot of the Duhy of Little Hermon (see at <a href="/joshua/19-18.htm">Joshua 19:18</a>), who became the king's nurse and waited upon him. The further remark, "and the king knew her not," is not introduced either to indicate the impotence of David or to show that she did not become David's concubine, but simply to explain how it was that it could possibly occur to Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/2-17.htm">1 Kings 2:17</a>) to ask for her as his wife. Moreover, the whole affair is to be judged according to the circumstances of the times, when there was nothing offensive in polygamy. </body></html>
