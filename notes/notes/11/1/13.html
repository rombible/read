Such as this is the counsel Christ's ministers give us in his name, to give all diligence, not only that no man take our crown, Re 3:11, but that we save our lives, even the lives of our souls. David made a solemn declaration of his firm cleaving to his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Even the recollection of the distresses from which the Lord redeemed him, increased his comfort, inspired his hopes, and animated him to his duty, under the decays of nature and the approach of death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It would have been in accordance with general Eastern custom for Solomon to suffer death, if Adonijah had succeeded in his attempt. But to have executed his mother also would have been an unusual severity. Still, such cases sometimes occurred: Cassander put to death Roxana, the widow of Alexander the Great, at the same time with her son, the young Alexander. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-27. Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba &#8230; let me &#8230; give thee counsel, &c.&#8212;The revolt was defeated by this prophet, who, knowing the Lord's will (2Sa 7:12; 1Ch 22:9), felt himself bound, in accordance with his character and office, to take the lead in seeing it executed. Hitherto the succession of the Hebrew monarchy had not been settled. The Lord had reserved to Himself the right of nomination (De 17:15), which was acted upon in the appointments both of Saul and David; and in the case of the latter the rule was so far modified that his posterity were guaranteed the perpetual possession of the sovereignty (2Sa 7:12). This divine purpose was known throughout the kingdom; but no intimation had been made as to whether the right of inheritance was to belong to the oldest son. Adonijah, in common with the people generally, expected that this natural arrangement should be followed in the Hebrew kingdom as in all others. Nathan, who was aware of the old king's solemn promise to Solomon, and, moreover, that this promise was sanctioned by the divine will, saw that no time was to be lost. Fearing the effects of too sudden excitement in the king's feeble state, he arranged that Bath-sheba should go first to inform him of what was being transacted without the walls, and that he himself should follow to confirm her statement. The narrative here not only exhibits the vivid picture of a scene within the interior of a palace, but gives the impression that a great deal of Oriental state ceremonial had been established in the Hebrew court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Didst not thou swear, </span> i.e. Thou didst swear; which David himself owneth, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm" title="Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.">1 Kings 1:30</a></span>, which probably he did to satisfy Bath-sheba’s doubts and fears about it, and to oblige himself to a compliance with the Divine will declared about it.

Like the Greek <span class="greekheb">ὄτι</span>, when it stands before a direct quotation, it should be left in most cases untranslated.

The pronoun ‘he’ is emphatically expressed in the original as also in <a href="/1_kings/1-24.htm" title="And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?">1 Kings 1:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm" title="Even as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.">1 Kings 1:30</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-35.htm" title="Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.">1 Kings 1:35</a>.

Joab joined the pretender, because he had fallen out with David for a considerable time (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5-6</a>), and hoped to secure his influence with the new king if he helped him to obtain possession of the throne. But what induced Abiathar the high priest (see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>) to join in conspiracy with Adonijah, we do not know. Possibly jealousy of Zadok, and the fear that under Solomon he might be thrown still more into the shade. For although Zadok was only high priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon, he appears to have taken the lead; as we may infer from the fact that he is always mentioned before Abiathar (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>, and <a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a>.). For we cannot imagine that Joab and Abiathar had supported Adonijah as having right on his side (Thenius), for the simple reason that Joab did not trouble himself about right, and for his own part shrank from no crime, when he thought that he had lost favour with the king.</body></html>
