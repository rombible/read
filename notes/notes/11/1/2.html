Commentary by Robert Jamieson   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>1Ki 1:1-4. Abishag Cherishes David in His Extreme Age.<p>1, 2. Now king David was old&#8212;He was in the seventieth year of his age (2Sa 5:4, 5). But the wear and tear of a military life, bodily fatigue, and mental care, had prematurely, if we may say it, exhausted the energies of David's strong constitution (1Sa 16:12). In modern Palestine and Egypt the people, owing to the heat of the climate, sleep each in a "separate" bed. They only depart from this practice for medical reasons (Ec 4:11). The expedient recommended by David's physicians is the regimen still prescribed in similar cases in the East, particularly among the Arab population, not simply to give heat, but "to cherish," as they are aware that the inhalation of young breath will give new life and vigor to the worn-out frame. The fact of the health of the young and healthier person being, as it were, stolen to support that of the more aged and sickly is well established among the medical faculty. And hence the prescription for the aged king was made in a hygienic point of view for the prolongation of his valuable life, and not merely for the comfort to be derived from the natural warmth imparted to his withered frame [Porter, Tent and Khan]. The polygamy of the age and country may account for the introduction of this practice; and it is evident that Abishag was made a concubine or secondary wife to David (see on [282]1Ki 2:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His servants; </span> his physicians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A young virgin; </span> whose natural heat is fresh and wholesome, and not impaired with bearing or breeding of children. The same counsel doth Galen give for the cure of some cold and dry distempers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let her stand before the king, </span> i.e. minister unto him, or wait upon him, (as this phrase is oft used,) in his sickness, as occasion requires. Let her lie in thy bosom, as his wife or concubine; for that she was so may appear by divers arguments. First, Otherwise this had been a wicked counsel and course; which therefore neither his servants durst have prescribed, nor would David have used, especially being now in a dying condition. And seeing this was easily prevented by his taking her for his concubine, which then was esteemed allowable, it is absurd to think that he would not choose the safer way. Secondly, That passage, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/1-4.htm" title="And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.">1 Kings 1:4</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but the king knew her not, </span> implies that the king might have had carnal knowledge of her without sin or scandal. Thirdly, it appears from this phrase of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">lying in his bosom, </span> which is every where in Scripture mentioned as the privilege of a wife and concubine, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/16-5.htm" title="And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong be on you: I have given my maid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and you.">Genesis 16:5</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm" title="If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, which is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;">Deu 13:6</a> <a href="/2_samuel/12-8.htm" title="And I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given to you such and such things.">2 Samuel 12:8</a> <a href="/micah/7-5.htm" title="Trust you not in a friend, put you not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of your mouth from her that lies in your bosom.">Micah 7:5</a></span>. Fourthly, This made Adonijah’s crime, in desiring her to wife, so heinous in Solomon’s account, because he wisely saw, that by marrying the king’s wife he designed to revive his pretence to the kingdom, at least in case of Solomon’s death; which pretence had been ridiculous, if she had been only the king’s handmaid. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore his servants said unto him,.... His physicians; so Joseph's physicians are called his servants, <a href="/genesis/50-2.htm">Genesis 50:2</a>;  <p>let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin; not only a young woman, but a virgin, that has more natural heat than women that have bore children have, which is abated thereby: <p>and let her stand before the king: minister to him, serve him with whatsoever he should want to eat or drink; and so by being in his presence, and taking things at her hand, she might be the more ingratiated into his affections: <p>and let her cherish him; as the husband the wife, so she her husband, as doubtless David was; and that by giving him cordials to cheer his spirits, and everything that was convenient for him, and particularly by lying with him. Kimchi interprets the word of her being profitable to him, in which sense the word is used, <a href="/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>; that is, by warming him; Ben Gersom understands it of her being made mistress of his treasures, according to the sense of the word in <a href="/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15</a>; that she might have the command of his purse, and provide anything proper for him, without being taken notice of or obstructed; but the Targum is better, <p>"and let her be near him,'' <p>lie close unto him, and even in his bosom, as in the next clause: <p>and let her lie in his bosom; which shows that it was proposed that he should marry her, at least that she should become his concubine wife, since this phrase is descriptive of a wife, <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>; nor can it be thought his physicians would advise, or he agree to have a young woman admitted to his bed, without marriage; and if this had not been the case, it would not have answered the design of Adonijah in requesting her in marriage after his father's death, which was to make way to ascend the throne when opportunity should offer; nor would his request have been so much resented by Solomon as it was, <a href="/1_kings/2-17.htm">1 Kings 2:17</a>; <p>that my lord the king may get heat: and somewhat similar to this, Galen, that great physician, prescribed in like cases (d). <p>(d) Vid.

Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> vii. 15.3) says they were the king’s physicians. (Cf. <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm" title="And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.">Genesis 1:2</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Let there be sought</span>] Literally ‘Let them seek.’ This kind of variation is frequent in the A.V. for the sake of the English; as also the personal form of a sentence, put where the Hebrew verb is impersonal. Thus the last clause in <a href="/1_kings/1-1.htm" title="Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.">1 Kings 1:1</a> is literally ‘and it grew not warm to him.’ As such literal renderings are very often noticed on the margin, no special mention will hereafter be made of them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a young virgin</span>] This device, whereby it was thought to communicate vital heat from a young frame to an old one, was adopted by the advice of physicians long after David’s time. See Bacon, <span class="ital">Hist. Vitœ et Mortis</span>, Medicamina ad longævitatem <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm" title="And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.">1 Kings 9:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and let her stand before the king</span>] This phrase is used of those who serve or minister to another. Thus <a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm" title="But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>, Joshua the minister of Moses is said to ‘stand before him.’ It seems clear from the language of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-22.htm" title="And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.">1 Kings 2:22</a>) that Abishag was to be counted as one of the wives of David. Polygamy was not at this time confined to kings like David and Solomon, but was practised by other Israelites, as is shewn by the history of Elkanah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-2.htm" title="And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.">1 Samuel 1:2</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his servants</span> [according to Josephus (Antiq. 7:14, 3), his physicians] <span class="cmt_word">said unto him, Let there be sought</span> [lit. as marg., "<span class="accented">let</span> <span class="accented">them seek"</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for my lord the king</span> [the singular pronoun is used as representing the servant who was spokesman for the rest] <span class="cmt_word">a young virgin</span> [marg., "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">damsel, a virgin."</span> She must be young, to impart heat, and a virgin, as befitted a king.
