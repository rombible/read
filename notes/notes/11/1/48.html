Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king bowed himself - The king worshipped God and prayed that it might be so.

The arrival of a trusty messenger, who gave a full detail of the coronation ceremony [1Ki 1:43-48], spread dismay in their camp. The wicked and ambitious plot they had assembled to execute was dissipated, and every one of the conspirators consulted his safety by flight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And also thus said the king,....

The music, therefore, and the joyful acclamations of the people must have been heard as far off as the fountain of Rogel. When Joab observed the sound of the trumpet, knowing what these tones must signify, he asked "wherefore the sound of the city in an uproar" (i.e., what does it mean)? At that moment Jonathan the son of Abiathar arrived (see <a href="/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>.). Adonijah called out to him: "Come, for thou art a brave man and bringest good tidings;' suppressing all anxiety with these words, as he knew his father's will with regard to the succession to the throne, and the powerful and influential friends of Solomon (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-19.htm">1 Kings 1:19</a>, <a href="/1_kings/1-26.htm">1 Kings 1:26</a>). </body></html>
