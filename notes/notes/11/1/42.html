Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jonathan had acted in a similar capacity, as a carrier of intelligence, in the time of Absalom's attempt <a href="/2_samuel/15-36.htm">2 Samuel 15:36</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>; but at that time, like his father, he was faithful to David, and "a valiant man," "a virtuous man," or "a man of worth."
