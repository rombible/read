Every true Israelite rejoices in the exaltation of the Son of David. Combinations formed upon evil principles will soon be dissolved, when self-interest calls another way. How can those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? Adonijah had despised Solomon, but soon dreaded him. We see here, as in a glass, Jesus, the Son of David and the Son of God, exalted to the throne of glory, notwithstanding all his enemies. His kingdom is far greater than that of his father David, and therein all the true people of God cordially rejoice. The prosperity of his cause is vexation and terror to his enemies. No horns of the altar, nor forms of godliness, nor pretences to religion, can profit those who will not submit to His authority, and accept of his salvation; and if their submission be hypocritical, they shall perish without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the "horns" of the altar, see <a href="/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a> note.

Adonijah &#8230; went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar&#8212;most probably the altar of burnt offering which had been erected on Mount Zion, where Abiathar, one of his partisans, presided as high priest. The horns or projections at the four corners of the altar, to which the sacrifices were bound, and which were tipped with the blood of the victim, were symbols of grace and salvation to the sinner. Hence the altar was regarded as a sanctuary (Ex 21:14), but not to murderers, rebels, or deliberate perpetrators. Adonijah, having acted in opposition to the will of the reigning king, was guilty of rebellion, and stood self-condemned. Solomon spared his life on the express condition of his good behavior&#8212;living in strict privacy, leading a quiet, peaceable life, and meddling with the affairs of neither the court nor the kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He owns Solomon as his king, and himself as his servant and subject; and being sensible of his great guilt, and of the jealousy which kings have of their competitors, could not be satisfied without Solomon’s oath. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was told Solomon,....

Both courtiers and criminals hasten to give the young king his new honours. In Adonijah's mouth it is also a virtual abdication of his claim to the throne and a direct acknowledgment of the new monarch. But see on vers. 1 and 35.] <span class="cmt_word">swear unto me today</span> [Cf. <a href="/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>. This is one of many passages which show how lightly the Jews esteemed promises in comparison with oaths. The sentiment possibly took its rise in the oaths sworn by the Divine Being (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/24-7.htm">Genesis 24:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>, etc.), though it is possible, on the other hand, that these asseverations were made in deference to the popular sentiment. Be that as it may, the oath held a much more conspicuous and important place in the Jewish than the Christian economy.

Even our Lord, who rebuked the habit (<a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34-37</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16-22</a>) respected the adjuration of Caiaphas, and St. Paul frequently appeals to God (<a href="/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>.)

The repetition of &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; three times (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-46.htm">1 Kings 1:46-48</a>) gives emphasis to the words, since every new point which is introduced with &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; raises the thing higher and higher towards absolute certainty. The fact related in <a href="/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a> refers to the words of Benaiah in <a href="/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a> and <a href="/1_kings/1-37.htm">1 Kings 1:37</a>. The Chethib &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; is the correct reading, and the Keri &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; an unnecessary emendation. The prayer to God, with thanksgiving for the favour granted to him, was offered by David after the return of his anointed son Solomon to the royal palace; so that it ought strictly to have been mentioned after <a href="/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>. The worship of grey-headed David upon the bed recalls to mind the worship of the patriarch Jacob after making known his last will (<a href="/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a>). </body></html>
