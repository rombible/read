The royal progress was of public importance. It was a season of national devotion. The king was accompanied by his principal nobility (2Ch 1:2); and, as the occasion was most probably one of the great annual festivals which lasted seven days, the rank of the offerer and the succession of daily oblations may help in part to account for the immense magnitude of the sacrifices.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The great high place; </span> the most eminent and frequented, because there was the tabernacle and the altar of Moses, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm" title="And Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,">1 Chronicles 16:39</a> 21:29 <a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>,5,6</span>, which possibly were placed upon a high or raised ground. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar; </span> thereby showing his special respect to this above all other places, and by his example teaching and inviting all his people to do so. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there,....

It is most known in early times for the cunning device of its inhabitants to secure a treaty with Joshua and the Israelites (Joshua 9), and in later history because it was the place where the tabernacle of the congregation and the brazen altar of burnt-offering were set up until the completion of Solomon’s temple.
