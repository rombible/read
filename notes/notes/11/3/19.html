Notice the difficulty of the case. To find out the true mother, he could not try which the child loved best, and therefore tried which loved the child best: the mother's sincerity will be tried, when the child is in danger. Let parents show their love to their children, especially by taking care of their souls, and snatching them as brands out of the burning. By this and other instances of the wisdom with which God endued him, Solomon had great reputation among his people. This was better to him than weapons of war; for this he was both feared and loved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Solomon determined to inaugurate his reign by a grand religious ceremonial at each of the two holy places which at this time divided between them the reverence of the Jews. Having completed the religious service at Gibeon, where was the tabernacle of the congregation, he proceeded to Jerusalem, and sacrificed before the ark of the covenant, which was in Mount Zion <a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>. A great feast naturally followed on a large sacrifice of peace-offerings. In these the sacrificer always partook of the flesh of the victim, and he was commanded to call in to the feast the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>.

His Judgment between Two Harlots.<p>16. Then came there two women&#8212;Eastern monarchs, who generally administer justice in person, at least in all cases of difficulty, often appeal to the principles of human nature when they are at a loss otherwise to find a clue to the truth or see clearly their way through a mass of conflicting testimony. The modern history of the East abounds with anecdotes of judicial cases, in which the decision given was the result of an experiment similar to this of Solomon upon the natural feelings of the contending parties.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> And so smothered it; which she justly conjectures, because there were evidences of that kind of death, but no appearance of any other cause thereof. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And this woman's child died in the night,....
