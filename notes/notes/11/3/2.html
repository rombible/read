It is clear that these high places were of two kinds—places of sacrifice to false gods, and unauthorised sanctuaries of the Lord, probably associating His worship with visible representations of Deity. The former class were, of course, absolute abominations, like the high places of the Canaanite races, so sternly denounced in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-2.htm" title="You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>. The prohibition of the other class of high places—constantly disobeyed by some even of the better kings—appears to have had two distinct objects—(<span class= "ital">a</span>) to guard against all local corruptions of God’s service, and all idolatry, worshipping Him (as at Bethel) under visible forms; (<span class= "ital">b</span>) to prevent the breach of national unity, by the congregation of the separate tribes round local sanctuaries. But besides these objects, it served (<span class= "ital">c</span>), as a very remarkable spiritual education for the worship of the invisible God, without the aid of local and visible emblems of His presence, in accordance with the higher prophetic teaching, and preparatory for the perfect spirituality of the future. It is, indeed, hardly to be conceived that there should not have been before the Captivity some places of non-sacrificial worship, in some degree like the synagogues of the period after the exile, although not as yet developed into a fully organised system. Unless we refer <a href="/psalms/74-8.htm" title="They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.">Psalm 74:8</a> to the Maccabæan times, it must be supposed to describe the Chaldæan invasion, as destroying not only the Temple, but also “all the houses of God”—properly “assemblies,” and in our Bible version actually translated “synagogues “—“in the land.” But these places of prayer and praise and instruction would be different in their whole idea from the “high places” rivalling the Temple. Up to this time it is clear that, even under Samuel and David, sacrificial worship elsewhere than in the Tabernacle was used without scruple, though certainly alien from the spirit of the Mosaic Law as to the supreme sacredness of the “place which God should choose to place his name there.” (See, for example, <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm" title="And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.">1Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm" title="And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.">1Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-35.htm" title="And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD.">1Samuel 14:35</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.

After the solemn consecration of the Temple, the circumstances and the character of such worship were altogether changed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm" title="Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.">1 Kings 3:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Only the people sacrificed in high places </span>— Which were groves, or other convenient places upon hills. In such places the patriarchs had been wont to offer up their worship, and sacrifices to God; and from them this custom was derived both to the Gentiles and the Jews; and in them the Gentiles sacrificed to idols, and the Hebrews to the true God. But this custom was expressly forbidden by God to his people, except in some extraordinary cases, and they were commanded to offer their sacrifices and other oblations only in the place which the Lord should choose, and where his tabernacle, altar, and ark should be, <a href="/context/leviticus/17-3.htm" title="What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that kills it out of the camp,...">Leviticus 17:3-5</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-10.htm" title="But when you go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;...">Deuteronomy 12:10-14</a>. It is, therefore, here mentioned as an exception to Solomon’s integrity and glory, and the happiness of his reign, and as a blemish to his government, that he permitted and practised what was thus so expressly forbidden. Possibly he permitted it because he thought it better to allow of an error in a circumstance, than occasion a neglect of God’s worship altogether, which he apprehended would follow upon a severe prohibition of that practice. For the people’s hearts were generally and constantly set upon these high places, as appears from the following history; and they were not willing to submit to the trouble and charge which the bringing their sacrifices to one place would cause, nor, indeed, would they yield to it until the temple was built: and, as that was speedily to be done, Solomon seems to have thought it more advisable to delay enforcing obedience to God’s law in this point for the present, than by force to drive them to it. These, however, and all other prudential considerations, ought to have given place to the will and wisdom of God. <span class="ital">Because there was no house built to the name of the Lord — </span>For his service, and to the honour, and praise, and glory of his name; that is, of his majesty, and all his perfections, which were to be adored and manifested there.

Solomon was a wise man, a rich man, a great man; yet the brightest praise of him, is that which is the character of all the saints, even the poorest, He loved the Lord. Where God sows plentifully, he expects to reap accordingly; and those that truly love God and his worship, will not grudge the expenses of their religion. We must never think that wasted which is laid out in the service of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word "only" introduces a contrast. The writer means to say that there was one exception to the flourishing condition of things which he has been describing, namely, that "the people sacrificed in high-places." (Compare the next verse.) The Law did not forbid "high-places" directly, but only by implication. It required the utter destruction of all the high-places which had been polluted by idolatrous rites <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; and the injunction to offer sacrifices nowhere except at the door of the tabernacle <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3-5</a> was an indirect prohibition of them, or, at least, of the use which the Israelites made of them; but there was some real reason to question whether this was a command intended to come into force until the "place" was chosen "where the Lord would cause His name to dwell." (See <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>.) The result was that high-places were used for the worship of Yahweh, from the time of the Judges downward <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>; <a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-35.htm">1 Samuel 14:35</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>, with an entire unconsciousness of guilt on the part of those who used them. And God so far overlooked this ignorance that He accepted the worship thus offered Him, as appears from the vision vouchsafed to Solomon on this occasion. There were two reasons for the prohibition of high-places; first, the danger of the old idolatry creeping back if the old localities were retained for worship; and, secondly, the danger to the unity of the nation if there should be more than one legitimate religious center. The existence of the worship at high places did, in fact, facilitate the division of the kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 3:2-5.

The kingdom was established and all was well in temporal matters, but there was still a part of the Divine appointment not duly observed. There were high places in considerable numbers on which the people offered sacrifices. It was ordained (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-13.htm" title="Take heed to yourself that you offer not your burnt offerings in every place that you see:...">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>) that this should not be so. “Offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest, but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes.’ But as yet this one place had not been fixed. So the previous ordinance of Exodus (<a href="/1_kings/20-24.htm" title="And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:">1 Kings 20:24</a>) intended for an unsettled time was still adhered to. God had there said ‘In all places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.’ An altar of earth was to be erected, and burnt offerings and peace offerings brought thither. This early ordinance was doubtless meant to be superseded as soon as possible after the settlement in Canaan, but events happened which delayed the choice of one place for all offerings, and so we find that God accepts the sacrifice of Gideon at Ophrah (<a href="/judges/6-23.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Peace be to you; fear not: you shall not die.">Jdg 6:23</a>), of Manoah at Zorah (<a href="/judges/13-19.htm" title="So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it on a rock to the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.">Jdg 13:19</a>), while Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm" title="And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:">1 Samuel 9:12</a>) offers sacrifice at the high place in the land of Zuph, and many other instances of the worship in the high places are to be found in the books of Samuel, and there is no expression anywhere of God’s disapproval. As soon as we enter on the books of the Kings we find that the writer has another standpoint, and counts it an evil that the high places still remain. Hence the language of this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sacrificed</span>] It is not possible to express the exact force in good English of the participle used both here and in the next verse. It implies the continuance of this custom, both with king and people, of worshipping on the high places. The Hebrew requires both here and in the following verse ‘in <span class="bld">the</span> high places.’ They were well-known seats of worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the name of the Lord</span>] The phrase in the Pentateuch is that God ‘chooses to place His name’ where He desires to be worshipped. Cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-23.htm" title="And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-2.htm" title="You shall therefore sacrifice the passover to the LORD your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-6.htm" title="But at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 16:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; &c.

The idea rather is that just as he was obliged to bring his Egyptian wife into the city of David, because his palace was not yet finished, so the people were compelled to sacrifice on the high places, because the temple was not yet built (Keil), and "the place" where God would put His name had only just been chosen (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">the people sacrificed</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">were sacrificing, i.e.</span>, habitually, constantly] <span class="cmt_word">in high places</span> [All nations have chosen hill tops for acts of worship, perhaps as being nearer heaven. "Even Abraham built an altar to the Lord on a mountain near Bethel  (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 8</a>; cf. 22:2, 9; 31:54)." And the use of high places for this purpose was not <span class="accented">distinctly</span> condemned in the Law. It is true the Hebrews were commanded to have but one place of sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/17-9.htm">Leviticus 17:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 13, 26, 27</a>; cf. <a href="/joshua/22-29.htm">Joshua 22:29</a>), and this no doubt was, if not an indirect prohibition, a discouragement of such sanctuaries. It has been held, however, that this command was purely prospective, and it is certainly remarkable that even when the Israelites were settled in the promised land, and the tabernacle was set up (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), altars were constantly built and sacrifices offered on high places, and sometimes, as in the case of Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>), and Manoah (<a href="/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19, 20</a>), by express Divine command. Later on we find Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9, 10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>), Saul (1 Samuel 13:9; 14:35), David (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>), Solomon and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>), offering sacrifices in various places, which they could not possibly have done had it seemed to them that this was condemned beforehand by the Law. It is highly probable, therefore, that though the contemporaries of Joshua took a different view (as <a href="/joshua/22-15.htm">Joshua 22:15-31</a> proves), the men of a later age excused themselves on the ground stated in the text, that "there was no house built unto the name of the Lord." It has been held by some that "had they not sacrificed and burnt incense on high places, they could not have sacrificed or burnt incense at all" (Bp. Horsley); but this seems to overlook the fact that there was one place provided for sacrifices - the door of the tabernacle &#8212;  and that for some reason or other they sacrificed elsewhere. And the reason, no doubt, was the one assigned by the historian.
