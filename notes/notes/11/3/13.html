While his bodily powers were locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice. God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to give him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us in our particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because he did not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A striking illustration of that law of the divine government to which Christ referred (marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the speech pleased the Lord&#8212;It was Solomon's waking prayers that God heard and requited, but the acceptance was signified in this vision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have also given; </span> either, first, I have granted and decreed to give; for words signifying action are oft put only for the purpose of the action.

There is a connection between the question which God addressed to Solomon in the dream, "What shall I give thee?" and the object of the sacrifice, viz., to seek the help of God for his reign. Solomon commences his prayer in <a href="/1_kings/3-6.htm">1 Kings 3:6</a> with an acknowledgment of the great favour which the Lord had shown to his father David, and had continued till now by raising his son to his throne (&#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, as it is this day: cf. <a href="/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>, etc.); and then, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7-9</a>, in the consciousness of his incapacity for the right administration of government over so numerous a people, he asks the Lord for an obedient heart and for wisdom to rule His people. &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; introduces the petition, the reasons assigned for which are, (1) his youth and inexperience, and (2) the greatness or multitude of the nation to be governed. I am, says he, &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;, i.e., an inexperienced youth (Solomon was only about twenty years old): "I know not to go out and in," i.e., how to behave myself as king, or govern the people (for &#1493;&#1489;&#1488; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; compare the note on <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>).
