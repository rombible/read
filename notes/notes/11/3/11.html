All these secondary blessings are good, just so far as they conduce to the supreme good, which is the growth of the human nature, by the knowledge of God and by faithfully doing His work on earth, to the perfection designed for it in His wisdom. So long as Solomon used them in subordination to true wisdom, they were a blessing to him; when he made them idols, they became a curse. The connection of these lower gifts with the moral and intellectual gifts of wisdom, is the result of the natural law of God’s Providence, so far as that law overcomes the resistance of evil and folly, still allowed to strive against it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/3-11.htm" title="And God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life; neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies; but have asked for yourself understanding to discern judgment;...">1 Kings 3:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Nor hast asked the life of thine enemies — </span>That God would take away their lives, or put it into his power to destroy them. <span class="ital">Behold I have done according to thy word — </span>I have granted, and do at this present grant thy desire. And accordingly at this time God did infuse into him a far higher degree of wisdom than he had before possessed; and that not only to govern his people, and to know and do the several duties which he owed to God and them, but also the knowledge of divers arts and sciences, and of things human and divine, as appears from <a href="/context/1_kings/4-29.htm" title="And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore....">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>; and that in a far greater measure and proportion, than with the best natural understanding he could have attained by the most diligent study, if he had been employed therein from a child. <span class="ital">So that there was none like thee before thee — </span>Either no king, or rather no man.

No mere man, it appears, since the fall of Adam, ever equalled him in universal knowledge, especially in the art of well governing his people. But, it may be asked, did not the apostles excel him? Not in natural and political knowledge, but only in the knowledge of the mysteries of faith, which were more freely and more fully imparted in these latter times; the ignorance whereof was no disparagement to Solomon’s wisdom, because they were not discoverable by any creature without that divine revelation which God saw fit not to afford in Solomon’s time.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:5-15 Solomon's dream was not a common one. While his bodily powers were locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice. God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to give him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us in our particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because he did not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thine enemies - e. g.

There is a connection between the question which God addressed to Solomon in the dream, "What shall I give thee?" and the object of the sacrifice, viz., to seek the help of God for his reign. Solomon commences his prayer in <a href="/1_kings/3-6.htm">1 Kings 3:6</a> with an acknowledgment of the great favour which the Lord had shown to his father David, and had continued till now by raising his son to his throne (&#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, as it is this day: cf. <a href="/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>, etc.); and then, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7-9</a>, in the consciousness of his incapacity for the right administration of government over so numerous a people, he asks the Lord for an obedient heart and for wisdom to rule His people. &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; introduces the petition, the reasons assigned for which are, (1) his youth and inexperience, and (2) the greatness or multitude of the nation to be governed. I am, says he, &#1511;&#1496;&#1503; &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;, i.e., an inexperienced youth (Solomon was only about twenty years old): "I know not to go out and in," i.e., how to behave myself as king, or govern the people (for &#1493;&#1489;&#1488; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; compare the note on <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>). At <a href="/1_kings/3-8.htm">1 Kings 3:8</a> he describes the magnitude of the nation in words which recall to mind the divine promises in <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>, to indicate how gloriously the Lord has fulfilled the promises which He made to the patriarchs.</body></html>
