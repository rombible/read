While his bodily powers were locked up in sleep, the powers of his soul were strengthened; he was enabled to receive the Divine vision, and to make a suitable choice. God, in like manner, puts us in the ready way to be happy, by assuring us we shall have what we need, and pray for. Solomon's making such a choice when asleep, and the powers of reason least active, showed it came from the grace of God. Having a humble sense of his own wants and weakness, he pleads, Lord, I am but a little child. The more wise and considerate men are, the better acquainted they are with their own weakness, and the more jealous of themselves. Solomon begs of God to give him wisdom. We must pray for it, Jas 1:5, that it may help us in our particular calling, and the various occasions we have. Those are accepted of God, who prefer spiritual blessings to earthly good. It was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked. God gave him wisdom, such as no other prince was ever blessed with; and also gave him riches and honour. If we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will bring outward prosperity with them, or sweeten the want of it. The way to get spiritual blessings, is to wrestle with God in prayer for them. The way to get earthly blessings, is to refer ourselves to God concerning them. Solomon has wisdom given him, because he did ask it, and wealth, because he did not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references.

The limiting &#1512;&#1511;, only, by which this general account of the existing condition of the religious worship is appended to what precedes, may be accounted for from the antithesis to the strengthening of the kingdom by Solomon mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/2-46.htm">1 Kings 2:46</a>. The train of thought is the following: It is true that Solomon's authority was firmly established by the punishment of the rebels, so that he was able to ally himself by marriage with the king of Egypt; but just as he was obliged to bring his Egyptian wife into the city of David, because the building of his palace as not yet finished, so the people, and (according to <a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3</a>) even Solomon himself, were only able to sacrifice to the Lord at that time upon altars on the high places, because the temple was not yet built. The participle &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; denotes the continuation of this religious condition (see Ewald, 168, c.). The &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, or high places,<p>(Note: The opinion of Bttcher and Thenius, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; signifies a "sacred coppice," is only based upon untenable etymological combinations, and cannot be proved. And Ewald's view is equally unfounded, viz., that "high places were an old Canaanaean species of sanctuary, which at that time had become common in Israel also, and consisted of a tall stone of a conical shape, as the symbol of the Holy One, and of the real high place, viz., an altar, a sacred tree or grove, or even an image of the one God as well" (Gesch. iii. p. 390). For, on the one hand, it cannot be shown that the tall stone of a conical shape existed even in the case of the Canaanitish bamoth, and, on the other hand, it is impossible to adduce a shadow of a proof that the Israelitish bamoth, which were dedicated to Jehovah, were constructed precisely after the pattern of the Baal's-bamoth of the Canaanites.)<p>were places of sacrifice and prayer, which were built upon eminences of hills, because men thought they were nearer the Deity there, and which consisted in some cases probably of an altar only, though as a rule there was an altar with a sanctuary built by the side (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="/1_kings/13-32.htm">1 Kings 13:32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>, <a href="/2_kings/17-32.htm">2 Kings 17:32</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-19.htm">2 Kings 23:19</a>), so that &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; frequently stands for &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>), and the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is also distinguished from the &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495; (<a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a>). These high places were consecrated to the worship of Jehovah, and essentially different from the high places of the Canaanites which were consecrated to Baal. Nevertheless sacrificing upon these high places was opposed to the law, according to which the place which the Lord Himself had chosen for the revelation of His name was the only place where sacrifices were to be offered (<a href="/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3</a>.); and therefore it is excused here on the ground that no house (temple) had yet been built to the name of the Lord.</body></html>
