Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We need not suppose a complete shattering of the altar, but rather the appearance of a crack or fissure in the fabric, which, extending from top to bottom, caused the embers and the fragments of the victims to fall until they reached the ground. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-9. he cried against the altar&#8212;which is put for the whole system of worship organized in Israel.<p>Behold, a child shall be born &#8230; Josiah by name&#8212;This is one of the most remarkable prophecies recorded in the Scriptures; and, in its clearness, circumstantial minuteness, and exact prediction of an event that took place three hundred sixty years later, it stands in striking contrast to the obscure and ambiguous oracles of the heathen. Being publicly uttered, it must have been well known to the people; and every Jew who lived at the accomplishment of the event must have been convinced of the truth of a religion connected with such a prophecy as this. A present sign was given of the remote event predicted, in a visible fissure being miraculously made on the altar. Incensed at the man's license of speech, Jeroboam stretched out his hand and ordered his attendants to seize the bold intruder. That moment the king's arm became stiff and motionless, and the altar split asunder, so that the fire and ashes fell on the floor. Overawed by the effects of his impiety, Jeroboam besought the prophet's prayer. His request was acceded to, and the hand was restored to its healthy state. Jeroboam was artful, and invited the prophet to the royal table, not to do him honor or show his gratitude for the restoration of his hand, but to win, by his courtesy and liberal hospitality, a person whom he could not crush by his power. But the prophet informed him of a divine injunction expressly prohibiting him from all social intercourse with any in the place, as well as from returning the same way. The prohibition not to eat or drink in Beth-el was because all the people had become apostates from the true religion, and the reason he was not allowed to return the same way was lest he should be recognized by any whom he had seen in going.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king answered, </span> i.e. spoke, as that word is oft used in both Testaments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Entreat now the face of the Lord thy God, </span> who by his zeal for time hath manifested himself to be thy God and Friend in a singular manner; and therefore will hear thy prayers for me, though he will not regard mine, because I have forsaken him and his worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The man of God besought the Lord, </span> to assure Jeroboam that what he had said was not from ill-will to him, and that he heartily desired his reformation, not his ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The king’s hand was restored again; </span> partly, to assure him that the stroke was from God; partly, because he repented of that violence which he intended against the prophet, for which God inflicted it; and partly, that the goodness of God to him might have led him to repentance; or if he continued impenitent, leave him without all excuse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king answered and said unto the man of God,....

We are not to conclude because Jeroboam says ‘the Lord thy God’ that he himself had ceased to acknowledge Jehovah. But in the present circumstances God was evidently more favourable to the prophet than to the king and this Jeroboam intends to express.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and pray for me</span>] These words are omitted in the LXX.

The pretext for this arbitrary alteration of the law, which repeatedly describes the seventh month as the month appointed by the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39</a>, <a href="/leviticus/23-41.htm">Leviticus 23:41</a>), he may have found in the fact that in the northern portion of the kingdom the corn ripened a month later than in the more southern Judah (see my Bibl. Archol. ii. 118, Anm. 3, and 119, Anm. 2), since this feast of the ingathering of the produce of the threshing-floor and wine-press (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>) was a feast of thanksgiving for the gathering in of all the fruits of the ground. But the true reason was to be found in his intention to make the separation in a religious point of view as complete as possible, although Jeroboam retained the day of the month, the fifteenth, for the sake of the weak who took offence at his innovations. For we may see very clearly that many beside the Levites were very discontented with these illegal institutions, from the notice in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-16.htm">2 Chronicles 11:16</a>, that out of all the tribes those who were devoted to the Lord from the heart went to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the God of the fathers there. "And he sacrificed upon the altar." This clause is connected with the preceding one, in the sense of: he instituted the feast and offered sacrifices thereat. In <a href="/1_kings/12-32.htm">1 Kings 12:32</a> (from &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; onwards) and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-33.htm">1 Kings 12:33</a>, what has already been related concerning Jeroboam's religious institutions is brought to a close by a comprehensive repetition of the leading points. "Thus did he in Bethel, (namely) to offer sacrifice to the calves; and there he appointed the priests of the high places which he had made, and offered sacrifice upon the altar which he had made at Bethel, on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, which he himself had devised, and so made a feast for the children of Israel and sacrificed upon the altar to turn." &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; signifies seorsum, by himself alone, i.e., in this connection, i.q. "from his own heart." The Keri &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; is therefore a correct explanation as to the fact; but it is a needless correction from <a href="/nehemiah/6-8.htm">Nehemiah 6:8</a>. The last clause, &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512;...&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, leads on to what follows, and it would be more correct to take it in connection with <a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a> and render it thus: and when he was offering sacrifice upon the altar to burn, behold there came a man of God, etc. Thenius has rendered &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; incorrectly, and he stood at the altar. This thought would have been expressed by &#1492;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;, as in <a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>. By &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512; we are not to understand the burning or offering of incense, but the burning of the sacrificial portions of the flesh upon the altar, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-17.htm">Leviticus 1:17</a>, etc. </body></html>
