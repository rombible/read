and no man shall be protected in disobedience, by his office, his nearness to God, or any services he has done for him. God warns all whom he employs, strictly to observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings, nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed, that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, that the soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way. He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to his family, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselves who think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dread prospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion and temptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance in the way of God's commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the anxiety of the Hebrews to be buried with their fathers, see <a href="/genesis/47-30.htm">Genesis 47:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>,<a href="/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. a lion met him by the way, and slew him&#8212;There was a wood near Beth-el infested with lions (2Ki 2:24). This sad catastrophe was a severe but necessary judgment of God, to attest the truth of the message with which the prophet had been charged. All the circumstances of this tragic occurrence (the undevoured carcass, the untouched ass, the passengers unmolested by the lion, though standing there) were calculated to produce an irresistible impression that the hand of God was in it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And, behold, men passed by,....

By this means, the very disobedience and death of the man of God became a part of the protest against the new rites. "For if the partaking of food against the commandment of God, though the result not of indulgence, but of deceit, brought so great a punishment upon a righteous man, what sort of chastisements would befall those who had left God their Maker and were worshipping senseless images" (Theodoret.)] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Seduction of the man of God by an old prophet, and his consequent punishment. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11-19</a>.

An old prophet at Bethel heard from his sons what had taken place (the singular &#1489;&#1504;&#1493; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; as compared with the plural &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; may be explained on the supposition that first of all one son related the matter to his father, and that then the other sons supported the account given by the first); had his ass saddled; hurried after him, and found him sitting under the terebinth (the tree well known from that event); invited him to come into his house and eat with him; and when the latter appealed to the divine prohibition, said to him (<a href="/1_kings/13-18.htm">1 Kings 13:18</a>), "I am a prophet also as thou art, and an angel has said to me in the word of the Lord: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat and drink," and lied to him (&#1500;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; without a copula, because it is inserted as it were parenthetically, simply as an explanation) - then he went back with him, and ate and drank in his house. </body></html>
