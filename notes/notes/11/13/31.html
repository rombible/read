God warns all whom he employs, strictly to observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings, nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed, that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, that the soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way. He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to his family, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselves who think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dread prospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion and temptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance in the way of God's commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He laid his carcase in his own grave - As Joseph of Arimathaea did the body of our Lord <a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>. The possession of rock-hewn tombs by families, or individuals, was common among the Jews from their first entrance into the holy land to their final expulsion. A sepulchre usually consisted of an underground apartment, into which opened a number of long, narrow "loculi," or cells, placed side by side, each adapted to receive one body. The cells were 6 or 7 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 3 feet high. They were commonly closed by a stone placed at the end of each. Many such tombs still exist in Palestine. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried&#8212;His motive in making this request was either that his remains might not be disturbed when the predicted events took place (see 2Ki 23:18), or he had some superstitious hope of being benefited at the resurrection by being in the same cave with a man of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That I may be secured from that judgment threatened <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm" title="And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus said the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense on you, and men's bones shall be burnt on you.">1 Kings 13:2</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying,....

For he tried to persuade him that his hand had become numb through fatigue in lifting the victims, and that when relieved it had returned to its natural state; and that the altar being new and having so many large victims put on it was broken and fell to pieces by the weight of its load. He also pointed to the death of him who had foretold these signs, how he was slain by the lion.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in</span>  <span class="cmt_word">the sepulchre</span> [Palestine, being of limestone formation, has a large number of caves.

On the road a lion met him and slew him; "and his corpse was cast in the road, but the ass stood by it, and the lion stood by the corpse." The lion, contrary to its nature, had neither consumed the prophet whom it had slain, nor torn in pieces and devoured the ass upon which he rode, but had remained standing by the corpse and by the ass, that the slaying of the prophet might not be regarded as a misfortune that had befallen him by accident, but that the hand of the Lord might be manifest therein, so that passers-by saw this marvel and related it in Bethel. </body></html>
