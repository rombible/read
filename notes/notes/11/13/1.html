It describes the circumstances of the action; and specifies the very name of the person who was to do it; and therefore every considerate Jew, who lived in the time of its accomplishment, must have been convinced of the divine authority of a religion founded on such prophecies as this; since none but God could foresee, and consequently none but God could fore-tel events at such a distance.” — Le Clerc, Calmet, and Dodd. <span class="ital">Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense — </span>Upon the feast day which he had instituted.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 In threatening the altar, the prophet threatens the founder and worshippers. Idolatrous worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for ever. The prediction plainly declared that the family of David would continue, and support true religion, when the ten tribes would not be able to resist them. If God, in justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful. Jeroboam looked for help, not from his calves, but from God only, from his power, and his favour. The time may come when those that hate the preaching, would be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. Jeroboam does not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might be pardoned, and his heart changed, but only that his hand might be restored. He seemed affected for the present with both the judgment and the mercy, but the impression wore off. God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Bethel, to show his detestation of their idolatry and apostacy from God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness. Those have not learned self-denial, who cannot forbear one forbidden meal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "in the word of the Lord."

The appearance of the prophet of Judah took place at the moment when the king was about to engage in the act of worship. We cannot be sure that the offering of incense by one who was not of the priestly race would be counted a sin in the days of Jeroboam. King Solomon (<a href="/context/1_kings/8-62.htm" title="And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD....">1 Kings 8:62-64</a>) is described as offering sacrifice, peace offerings and burnt offerings, without anything to indicate that it was not lawful. But no doubt as time went on, and probably before the composition of the history before us, the persons who alone were allowed to offer at the altars were the priests and Levites.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there came a man of God</span> [see on 1 Kings 12:22. The "man of God" is throughout carefully distinguished from the "prophet." Josephus calls the former Jadon, probably the Grecized form of Iddo, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>, which appears as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> Ia'do in the Keri of <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>. Iddo, however, notwithstanding his "visions against Jeroboam the son of Nebat" (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>), it cannot have been, for he survived to the reign of Abijah, and indeed wrote a "story" (Heb. <span class="accented">Midrash, i.e.</span>, Commentary) of that reign, whereas this man of God died forthwith. For a similar reason, we cannot believe it to have been Shemaiah, the historian of the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5, 15</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">out of Judah</span> [whither, as a rule, both priests and prophets would seem to have retreated (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-14.htm">2 Chronicles 11:14, 16</a>). It is clear, however, that the migration of the latter was not so general as that of the former. In ver. 11 we find a prophet at Bethel; in ch. 14. Ahijah is still at Shiloh, and at a later day we find <span class="accented">schools</span> of the prophets at Bethel, Jericho, etc. (<a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5</a>). Stanley says with truth that "the prophetical activity of the time...  is to be found in the kingdom, not of Judah, but of Israel," but omits to add that it was because the northern kingdom more especially needed their ministry. It was just for this reason that Ahijah and others remained at their posts.] <span class="cmt_word">by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in</span>, same word as in vers. 2, 9, 17, 20, 32, etc. Similarly, <a href="/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>.

"<span class="accented">By</span> the word" would imply that he had received a Divine communication; "<span class="accented">in</span> the word," that his message possessed him, inspired him, was "in his heart as a burning fire shut up in his bones" (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord unto Bethel</span> [It is worth remembering that the new sanctuary at Bethel would probably be visible from the temple  (Porter, p. 219; Van de Velds, 2:283), so that this function was an act of open defiance]: <span class="cmt_word">and Jeroboam stood by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">upon</span>.

This altar was clearly, <span class="accented">pro hac vice</span>, an altar of burnt offering; not an altar of incense, as is proved by the next verse.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He therefore consulted, sc., with his counsellors, or the heads of the nation, who had helped him to the throne, and made two calves of gold. &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497; are young oxen, not of pure gold however, or cast in brass and gilded, but in all probability like the golden calf which Aaron had cast for the people at Sinai, made of a kernel of wood, which was then covered with gold plate (see the Comm. on <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). That Jeroboam had in his mind not merely the Egyptian Apis-worship generally, but more especially the image-worship which Aaron introduced for the people at Sinai, is evident from the words borrowed from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>, with which he studiously endeavoured to recommend his new form of worship to the people: "Behold, this is thy God, O Israel, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, it is too much for you to go to Jerusalem; not "let your going suffice," because &#1502;&#1503; is not to be taken in a partitive sense here, as it is in <a href="/exodus/9-28.htm">Exodus 9:28</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-6.htm">Ezekiel 44:6</a>. What Jeroboam meant to say by the words, "Behold thy God," etc., was, "this is no new religion, but this was the form of worship which our fathers used in the desert, with Aaron himself leading the way" (Seb. Schmidt). And whilst the verbal allusion to that event at Sinai plainly shows that this worship was not actual idolatry, i.e., was not a worship of Egyptian idols, from which it is constantly distinguished in our books as well as in Hosea and Amos, but that Jehovah was worshipped under the image of the calves or young oxen; the choice of the places in which the golden calves were set up also shows that Jeroboam desired to adhere as closely as possible to ancient traditions. He did not select his own place of residence, but Bethel and Dan. Bethel, on the southern border of his kingdom, which properly belonged to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a> and <a href="/joshua/18-22.htm">Joshua 18:22</a>), the present Beitin, had already been consecrated as a divine seat by the vision of Jehovah which the patriarch Jacob received there in a dream (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>, <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), and Jacob gave it the name of Bethel, house of God, and afterwards built an altar there to the Lord (<a href="/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>). And Jeroboam may easily have fancied, and have tried to persuade others, that Jehovah would reveal Himself to the descendants of Jacob in this sacred place just as well as He had done to their forefather. - Dan, in the northern part of the kingdom, on the one source of the Jordan, formerly called Laish (<a href="/judges/18-26.htm">Judges 18:26</a>.), was also consecrated as a place of worship by the image-worship established there by the Danites, at which even a grandson of Moses had officiated; and regard may also have been had to the convenience of the people, namely, that the tribes living in the north would not have to go a long distance to perform their worship.</body></html>
