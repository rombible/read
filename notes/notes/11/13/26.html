There is in his words a characteristic reticence as to his own share in the work, in respect both of the deceit and the prediction of judgment, perhaps indicating something of the strange mixture of remorse and unscrupulous policy which comes out in his later action.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:23-34 God is displeased at the sins of his own people; and no man shall be protected in disobedience, by his office, his nearness to God, or any services he has done for him. God warns all whom he employs, strictly to observe their orders. We cannot judge of men by their sufferings, nor of sins by present punishments; with some, the flesh is destroyed, that the spirit may be saved; with others, the flesh is pampered, that the soul may ripen for hell. Jeroboam returned not from his evil way. He promised himself that the calves would secure the crown to his family, but they lost it, and sunk his family. Those betray themselves who think to support themselves by any sin whatever. Let us dread prospering in sinful ways; pray to be kept from every delusion and temptation, and to be enabled to walk with self-denying perseverance in the way of God's commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the anxiety of the Hebrews to be buried with their fathers, see <a href="/genesis/47-30.htm">Genesis 47:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>,<a href="/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. a lion met him by the way, and slew him&#8212;There was a wood near Beth-el infested with lions (2Ki 2:24).
