When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease and interest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the good prophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of being drawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonder that the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God was suddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? The judgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is a judgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience. This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver. They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as a tormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon; and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the anxiety of the Hebrews to be buried with their fathers, see <a href="/genesis/47-30.htm">Genesis 47:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>,<a href="/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah&#8212;rather, "it cried," that is, the word of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Thou shalt not die a natural, but a violent death; and that in this journey, before thou returnest to thy native habitation; and thy carcass shall not be buried in the proper sepulchre; which was esteemed a kind of curse, and a note of infamy; as the contrary was reckoned an honour and blessing.

And he opened the door, and fled.">2 Kings 9:10</a>). To be buried by the side of one’s ancestors shews that all care has been bestowed upon the corpse.
