When the change took place under Jeroboam, he preferred his ease and interest to his religion. He took a very bad method to bring the good prophet back. It was all a lie. Believers are most in danger of being drawn from their duty by plausible pretences of holiness. We may wonder that the wicked prophet went unpunished, while the holy man of God was suddenly and severely punished. What shall we make of this? The judgments of God are beyond our power to fathom; and there is a judgment to come. Nothing can excuse any act of wilful disobedience. This shows what they must expect who hearken to the great deceiver. They that yield to him as a tempter, will be terrified by him as a tormentor. Those whom he now fawns upon, he will afterwards fly upon; and whom he draws into sin, he will try to drive to despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord - It was his duty not to have suffered himself to be persuaded. He should have felt that his obedience was being tried, and should have required, ere he considered himself released, "the same, or as strong, evidence," as that on which he had received the obligation. Disobedience to certain positive commands of God, was one which it was at this time very important to punish signally, since it was exactly the sin of Jeroboam and his adherents. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah&#8212;rather, "it cried," that is, the word of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He cried</span> with a loud voice, the effect of his passion, both for his own guilt and shame, and for the prophet’s approaching misery, and his unhappy influence both in procuring and in denouncing of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The mouth, </span> i.e. the word of command coming out of his mouth; a metonymy of the cause for the effect. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah,....

The man of God had resisted the invitations of Jeroboam, and set out by a different road to return to Judah. An old prophet at Bethel heard from his sons what had taken place (the singular &#1489;&#1504;&#1493; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; as compared with the plural &#1493;&#1497;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; may be explained on the supposition that first of all one son related the matter to his father, and that then the other sons supported the account given by the first); had his ass saddled; hurried after him, and found him sitting under the terebinth (the tree well known from that event); invited him to come into his house and eat with him; and when the latter appealed to the divine prohibition, said to him (<a href="/1_kings/13-18.htm">1 Kings 13:18</a>), "I am a prophet also as thou art, and an angel has said to me in the word of the Lord: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat and drink," and lied to him (&#1500;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; without a copula, because it is inserted as it were parenthetically, simply as an explanation) - then he went back with him, and ate and drank in his house. </body></html>
