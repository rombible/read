It pictures various national calamities, and in each recognises not mere evils, but chastisements of God, who desires by them to teach, and is most ready to forgive. First it naturally dwells on disaster in battle, which, in the whole history of the Exodus, of the Conquest, of the troubled age of the Judges, and of the reigns of Saul and David, is acknowledged as a sign of unfaithfulness in Israel, either through sin or through idolatry, to the covenant of God, on which the victorious possession of the promised land depended. On that history the blessing and the curse of the Law (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm" title="And I will set my face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.">Leviticus 26:17</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/26-32.htm" title="And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.">Leviticus 26:32-33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm" title="The LORD shall cause you to be smitten before your enemies: you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>) form a commentary of emphatic warning, and the Psalms again and again bring the same lesson home (<a href="/context/psalms/44-1.htm" title="We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the times of old.">Psalm 44:1-3</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/44-9.htm" title="But you have cast off, and put us to shame; and go not forth with our armies.">Psalm 44:9-17</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/60-9.htm" title="Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?">Psalm 60:9-11</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/89-42.htm" title="You have set up the right hand of his adversaries; you have made all his enemies to rejoice.">Psalm 89:42-46</a>). With characteristic seriousness, Solomon looks back from his peaceful prosperity on the stormy past, and from it learns to pray for the future.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/8-33.htm" title="When your people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray, and make supplication to you in this house:...">1 Kings 8:33-34</a></span>. <span class="ital">When thy people be smitten — </span>This is the second case he puts.

Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The oath come before ... - "The oath" is equivalent to "the man who swears the oath."

Solomon stood before the altar&#8212;This position was in the court of the people, on a brazen scaffold erected for the occasion (2Ch 6:13), fronting the altar of burnt offering, and surrounded by a mighty concourse of people. Assuming the attitude of a suppliant, kneeling (1Ki 8:54; compare 2Ch 6:24) and with uplifted hands, he performed the solemn act of consecration&#8212;an act remarkable, among other circumstances, for this, that it was done, not by the high priest or any member of the Aaronic family, but by the king in person, who might minister about, though not in, holy things. This sublime prayer [1Ki 8:22-35], which breathes sentiments of the loftiest piety blended with the deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national blessing and curse contained in the law&#8212;and the burden of it&#8212;after an ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people at the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding prayer [1Ki 8:56-61].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And confess thy name; </span> give glory to thy name, by acknowledging their sins, and thy justice; and by accepting the punishment of their iniquity; and by trusting to thy power and goodness alone for their deliverance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When thy people Israel shall be smitten down before the enemy,....

Ewald, 354, c.) of this house which I have built," in which the infinitude of God and His exaltation above the world are expressed as clearly and forcibly as possible, Solomon does not intend to guard against the delusion that God really dwells in temples (J. D. Mich.), but simply to meet the erroneous idea that He dwells in the temple as men dwell in a house, namely, shut up within it, and not also outside and above it, - a delusion which sometimes forced its way into the unspiritual nation but which was always attacked by the prophets (cf. <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, etc.). For it is evident that Solomon did combine with his clear perception of the infinite exaltation of God a firm belief in His real presence in the temple, and did not do homage to the abstract idealism of the rationalists, not merely from his declaration in <a href="/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>. that he had built this temple as a dwelling-place for God, but also from the substance of all the following prayers, and primarily from the general prayer in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>, that God would take this temple under His special protection, and hearken to every prayer directed towards it.
