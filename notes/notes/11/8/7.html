The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the tabernacle of the congregation - Not the tented structure erected for the ark on Mount Zion <a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a> by David, but the original tabernacle made by Moses, which had hitherto remained at Gibeon (margin reference). The tabernacle and its holy vessels were probably placed in the treasury. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-6. at the feast in the month Ethanim&#8212;The public and formal inauguration of this national place of worship did not take place till eleven months after the completion of the edifice. The delay, most probably, originated in Solomon's wish to choose the most fitting opportunity when there should be a general rendezvous of the people in Jerusalem (1Ki 8:2); and that was not till the next year. That was a jubilee year, and he resolved on commencing the solemn ceremonial a few days before the feast of tabernacles, which was the most appropriate of all seasons. That annual festival had been instituted in commemoration of the Israelites dwelling in booths during their stay in the wilderness, as well as of the tabernacle, which was then erected, in which God promised to meet and dwell with His people, sanctifying it with His glory. As the tabernacle was to be superseded by the temple, there was admirable propriety in choosing the feast of tabernacles as the period for dedicating the new place of worship, and praying that the same distinguished privileges might be continued to it in the manifestation of the divine presence and glory. At the time appointed for the inauguration, the king issued orders for all the heads and representatives of the nation to repair to Jerusalem and take part in the august procession [1Ki 8:1]. The lead was taken by the king and elders of the people, whose march must have been slow, as priests were stationed to offer an immense number of sacrifices at various points in the line of road through which the procession was to go. Then came the priests bearing the ark and the tabernacle&#8212;the old Mosaic tabernacle which was brought from Gibeon. Lastly, the Levites followed, carrying the vessels and ornaments belonging to the old, for lodgment in the new, house of the Lord. There was a slight deviation in this procedure from the order of march established in the wilderness (Nu 3:31; 4:15); but the spirit of the arrangement was duly observed. The ark was deposited in the oracle; that is, the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim&#8212;not the Mosaic cherubim, which were firmly attached to the ark (Ex 37:7, 8), but those made by Solomon, which were far larger and more expanded.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark,....

But in other respects it agrees almost word for word with our account.<p>With regard to the time of the dedication, it is merely stated in <a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a> that the heads of the nation assembled at Jerusalem to this feast in the seventh month. The year in which this took place is not given. But as the building of the temple was finished, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>, in the eighth month of the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, the dedication which followed in the seventh month cannot have taken place in the same year as the completion of the building. Ewald's opinion, that Solomon dedicated the building a month before it was finished, is not only extremely improbable in itself, but is directly at variance with <a href="/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>. If we add to this, that according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1-10</a> it was not till after the lapse of twenty years, during which he had built the two houses, the temple, and his palace, that the Lord appeared to Solomon at the dedication of the temple and promised to answer his prayer, we must decide in favour of the view held by Thenius, that the dedication of the temple did not take place till twenty years after the building of it was begun, or thirteen years after it was finished, and when Solomon had also completed the building of the palace, which occupied thirteen years, as the lxx have indicated at the commencement of <a href="/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a> by the interpolation of the words, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;.<p>(Note: From the whole character of the Alexandrian version, there can be no doubt that these words have been transferred by the lxx from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1</a>, and have not dropped out of the Hebrew text, as Thenius supposes.)<p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1-11</a>Removal of the ark of the covenant into the temple. - This solemn transaction was founded entirely upon the solemnities with which the ark was conveyed in the time of David from the house of Obed-edom into the holy tent upon Zion (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>.; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>.).
