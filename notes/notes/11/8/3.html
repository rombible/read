The delay, most probably, originated in Solomon's wish to choose the most fitting opportunity when there should be a general rendezvous of the people in Jerusalem (1Ki 8:2); and that was not till the next year. That was a jubilee year, and he resolved on commencing the solemn ceremonial a few days before the feast of tabernacles, which was the most appropriate of all seasons. That annual festival had been instituted in commemoration of the Israelites dwelling in booths during their stay in the wilderness, as well as of the tabernacle, which was then erected, in which God promised to meet and dwell with His people, sanctifying it with His glory. As the tabernacle was to be superseded by the temple, there was admirable propriety in choosing the feast of tabernacles as the period for dedicating the new place of worship, and praying that the same distinguished privileges might be continued to it in the manifestation of the divine presence and glory. At the time appointed for the inauguration, the king issued orders for all the heads and representatives of the nation to repair to Jerusalem and take part in the august procession [1Ki 8:1]. The lead was taken by the king and elders of the people, whose march must have been slow, as priests were stationed to offer an immense number of sacrifices at various points in the line of road through which the procession was to go. Then came the priests bearing the ark and the tabernacle&#8212;the old Mosaic tabernacle which was brought from Gibeon. Lastly, the Levites followed, carrying the vessels and ornaments belonging to the old, for lodgment in the new, house of the Lord. There was a slight deviation in this procedure from the order of march established in the wilderness (Nu 3:31; 4:15); but the spirit of the arrangement was duly observed. The ark was deposited in the oracle; that is, the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim&#8212;not the Mosaic cherubim, which were firmly attached to the ark (Ex 37:7, 8), but those made by Solomon, which were far larger and more expanded.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For although the Levites might do this, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm" title="And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.

And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.">Joshua 3:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-6.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.">Joshua 6:6</a>). At this time it was necessary that they should do so, for the ark was to be brought into the most holy place, whither the Levites (<a href="/numbers/4-20.htm" title="But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.">Numbers 4:20</a>) were forbidden to enter. Moreover, the final conveyance of the ark to its special seat was a duty to call for the most sacred of God’s ministers. It is worth while to compare with this passage the statement in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-4.htm" title="And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.">2 Chronicles 5:4</a>. There it is said ‘and the <span class="ital">Levites</span> took up the ark,’ and the narrative then continues, stating that the Levites ‘brought up’ the ark, i.e. carried it during the transfer, but before its introduction into the Temple, the phrase changes and we read ‘the <span class="ital">priests</span> brought in the ark of the covenant into his place.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the elders of Israel came</span> [Not a mere repetition.

But there is no contradiction, as has been too readily supposed. For ver. 7 of the Chronicles," <span class="accented">the priests</span> brought in the ark," etc., confirms the statement of the text. And the explanation is suggested in ver. 5 of the same chapter, "These did the priests, the Levites (so the Heb.) bring up." Same expression in <a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>. All the priests were Levites - Keil translates, "the Levitical priests" - and this somewhat singular expression is no doubt used to remind us that such was the case. Nor need it cause us any surprise to find the priests employed in this service. It is true that the ark was given into the charge of the Kohathite Levites (<a href="/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30, 31</a>); and it was their duty to bear it (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 11, 12</a>). But the real care and supervision of the ark always belonged to the sons of Aaron. It was their office, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to put on or take off the covering of the ark and of the vessels, which the Levites were forbidden directly to touch (<a href="/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>). It was quite in accordance with the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of these provisions that Solomon now entrusted the carriage of the ark to the superior order. But more than that, Solomon was not without precedent to justify his choice, indeed, we may see in his selection of the priests a minute mark of truth, amounting almost to an undo-signed coincidence. For we find that on occasions of extraordinary solemnity - at the crossing of the Jordan, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, (<a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6, 15, 17</a>), and at the siege of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6</a>), the <span class="accented">priests</span> had borne the ark (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11, 12</a>). It was no doubt these familiar precedents guided Solomon, or the ecclesiastical authorities, in their selection of the priests on this occasion. A "settled place," a "house of cedars" (<a href="/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a>), "having now been found for the ark" to abide in, after it had "dwelt in curtains" for 500 years, it was taking its last journey, and in order to mark this journey as exceptional, in order to show both the ark and the house the greater reverence, it was determined that it should be borne for the last time by the priests. Keil suggests that the ark may have been uncovered, but this is very improbable. Why, we may ask, were coverings provided, and their use prescribed (<a href="/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>), if they were to be arbitrarily dispensed with? He also adds that Levites were not allowed to enter the most holy place. But neither, it may be added, was this lawful for the priests. Levites and priests might enter that day, because the house was not then dedicated. The cloud (ver. 10) claimed it for God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The golden vessels of the Holy Place (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">2 Chronicles 4:19-22</a>). The vessels enumerated here are divided, by the repetition of &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>, into two classes, which were made of fine gold; and to this a third class is added in <a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a> which was made of gold of inferior purity. As &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; is governed in both instances by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474; as an accusative of the material, the &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; (gold) attached to the separate vessels must be taken as an adjective. "Solomon made all the vessels in the house of Jehovah (i.e., had them made): the golden altar, and the golden table on which was the shew-bread, and the candlesticks ... of costly gold (&#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;: see at <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>). The house of Jehovah is indeed here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>, the temple with its courts, and not merely the Holy Place, or the temple-house in the stricter sense; but it by no means follows from this that &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, "all the vessels," includes both the brazen vessels already enumerated and also the golden vessels mentioned afterwards. A decisive objection to our taking the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; (all) as referring to those already enumerated as well as those which follow, is to be found in the circumstance that the sentence commencing with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474; is only concluded with &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; in <a href="/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>. It is evident from this that &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is particularized in the several vessels enumerated from &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; onwards. These vessels no doubt belonged to the Holy Place or temple-house only; though this is not involved in the expression "the house of Jehovah," but is apparent from the context, or from the fact that all the vessels of the court have already been enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40-46</a>, and were made of brass, whereas the golden vessels follow here. That there were intended for the Holy Place is assumed as well known from the analogy of the tabernacle. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; merely affirms that the vessels mentioned afterwards belonged to the house of God, and were not prepared for the palace of Solomon or any other earthly purpose. We cannot infer from the expression "Solomon made" that the golden vessels were not made by Hiram the artist, as the brazen ones were (Thenius). Solomon is simply named as the builder of the temple, and the introduction of his name was primarily occasioned by <a href="/1_kings/7-47.htm">1 Kings 7:47</a>. The "golden altar" is the altar of incense in the Holy Place, which is called golden because it was overlaid with gold-plate; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>, its sides were covered with cedar wood, after the analogy of the golden altar in the tabernacle (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-5</a>). "And the table, upon which the shew-bread, of gold." &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; belongs to &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1503;, to which it stands in free subjection (vid., Ewald, 287, h), signifying "the golden table." Instead of &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1503; we have &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">2 Chronicles 4:19</a> (the tables), because there it has already been stated in <a href="/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8</a> that ten tables were made, and put in the Holy Place. In our account that verse is omitted; and hence there is only a notice of the table upon which the loaves of shew-bread generally lay, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>, in which the chronicler does not contradict himself, as Thenius fancies. The number ten, moreover, is required and proved to be correct in the case of the tables, by the occurrence of the same number in connection with the candlesticks. In no single passage of the Old Testament is it stated that there was only one table of shew-bread in the Holy Place of Solomon's temple.<p>(Note: Nothing can be learned from <a href="/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a> concerning the number of the vessels in the Holy Place. If we were to conclude from this passage that there were no more vessels in the Holy Place than are mentioned there, we should also have to assume, if we would not fall into a most unscientific inconsistency, that there was neither a candlestick nor a golden altar of incense in the Holy Place. The correct meaning of this passage may be gathered from the words of King Abiam in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a> : "We lay the shew-bread upon the pure table, and light the golden candlestick every evening;" from which it is obvious that here and there only the table and the candlestick are mentioned, because usually only one table had shew-bread upon it, and only one candlestick was lighted.)<p>The tables were certainly made of wood, like the Mosaic table of shew-bread, probably of cedar wood, and only overlaid with gold (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a>). "And the candlesticks, five on the right and five on the left, before the back-room." These were also made in imitation of the Mosaic candlestick (see <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>.), and were probably placed not near to the party wall in a straight line to the right and left of the door leading into the Most Holy Place, but along the two longer sides of the Holy Place; and the same with the tables, except that they stood nearer to the side walls with the candlesticks in front of them, so that the whole space might be lighted more brilliantly. The altar of burnt-offering, on the contrary, stood in front of and very near to the entrance into the Most Holy Place (see at <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>).<p>In the following clause (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>) the ornaments of the candlesticks are mentioned first, and then the rest of the smaller golden vessels are enumerated. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;, the flower-work, with which the candlesticks were ornamented (see <a href="/exodus/25-33.htm">Exodus 25:33</a>). The word is evidently used collectively here, so that the &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; mentioned along with them in the book of Exodus (l.c.) are included. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, the lamps, which were placed upon the shaft and arms of the candlestick (<a href="/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>). &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;, the snuffers (<a href="/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>). &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, basins in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>, here probably deep dishes (Schalen). &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, knives. &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514;, bowls (Schalen) or cans with spouts for the wine for the libations; according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-8.htm">2 Chronicles 4:8</a>, there were a hundred of these made. &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, small flat vessels, probably for carrying the incense to the altar. &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, extinguishers; see at <a href="/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>.</body></html>
