In the visions of Ezekiel the same glory is seen, first filling the house of the Lord, and then departing from it, as polluted by manifold idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.">Ezekiel 10:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.">Ezekiel 10:18</a>).

The symbol clearly implies a revelation of Divine glory, as it is seen, not in the unveiled brightness of heaven, but in the glorious cloud of mystery; through which it must always be seen on earth, and which, indeed, is all that the eye of man can bear to contemplate. Out of that glory comes the only revelation which can be distinct to man—the voice or the word of the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>).<p>The record of the Chronicles (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/5-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:">2Chronicles 5:11-13</a>)—dwelling, as usual, on the musical and ritual service of the Levites—notes here that this descent of the glory of the Lord came, as it were, in answer to a solemn burst of worship from the Levites and the people, “praising the Lord, because He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,...">1 Kings 8:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">When the priests were come out of the holy place — </span>That is, the most holy, where they had set down the ark. <span class="ital">The cloud — </span>The usual token of God’s glorious presence, <a href="/exodus/16-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.">Exodus 16:10</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/24-15.htm" title="And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount....">Exodus 24:15-16</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-15.htm" title="And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.">Numbers 9:15</a>; <span class="ital">filled the house of the Lord — </span>In testimony of his gracious acceptance of this work and their service; and to beget an awe and reverence in them and in all others when they approached to God. <span class="ital">So that the priests could not stand to minister — </span>By this it appears that the cloud filled the whole house, as well as the most holy place: for it was at the altar of incense in the sanctuary that the priests ministered.

The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2. The darkness of our present state, in comparison with the sight of God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the Divine glory is unveiled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The cloud - the visible symbol of the divine presence - the Shechinah of the Targums - which halt been promised before the ark was begun <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43</a>, and had filled the tabernacle as soon as it was completed <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>, and which had probably been seen from time to time during the long interval when we have no express mention of it, now once more appeared in full magnificence, and took, as it were, possession of the building which Solomon was dedicating.

The article denotes that it was something well known and perhaps permanent. Cf. <a href="/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle....">Exodus 40:34-35</a> where it is said ‘the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle, and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting because the cloud abode thereon.’ This was the token that God had taken up His abode there, and thus a standing lesson was before the eyes of the people concerning the fact of the Incarnation. Josephus says of this cloud that ‘it produced in the minds of all the notion and thought that God had come down into the Temple, and was gladly tabernacling therein.’ It was indeed the Shechinah, the dwellingplace of God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out</span> [Rather, <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">the priests came out</span>] of <span class="cmt_word">the holy place</span> [It has been supposed that "the holy" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is  here put for the <span class="accented">most</span> holy place, as in <a href="/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a>. But this is not by any means the necessary interpretation. The cloud may obviously have filled the <span class="accented">entire</span> building only as the priests left it. It would seem, however, from verse 11 as if the priests, having left the <span class="accented">oracle</span>, were about to min later in the holy place], <span class="cmt_word">that</span> <span class="cmt_word">the cloud</span> [Observe the article; the well known cloud which betokened the Divine presence.

It is hardly correct to identify the cloud with the Shechinah of the Targums (Rawlinson), for it is noticeable that the Targums never render "the cloud" or "the glory" by "the Shechinah." In fact, as regards the use of the word by Jewish writers, it would seem to be a periphrasis for God (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1241). We may see in the cloud, however, the <span class="accented">seat</span> of the Shechinah (Kitto, Cyclopedia,  3. p. 821) <span class="cmt_word">filled the house of the Lord.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the arrival of all the elders (i.e., of the representatives of the nation, more particularly described in <a href="/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>), the priests carried the ark and brought it up (sc., into the temple), with the tabernacle and all the holy vessels in it. The expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, which follows, introduces as a supplementary notice, according to the general diffuseness of the early Hebrew style of narrative, the more precise statement that the priests and Levites brought up these sacred vessels. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; is not the tent erected for the ark of the covenant upon Zion, which can be proved to have been never so designated, and which is expressly distinguished from the former in <a href="/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a> as compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>, but is the Mosaic tabernacle at Gibeon in front of which Solomon had offered sacrifice (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>). The tabernacle with the vessels in it, to which, however, the ark of the covenant, that had long been separated from it, did not belong, was probably preserved as a sacred relic in the rooms above the Most Holy Place. The ark of the covenant was carried by priests on all solemn occasions, according to the spirit of the law, which enjoined, in <a href="/numbers/3-31.htm">Numbers 3:31</a> and <a href="/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5</a>., that the ark of the covenant and the rest of the sacred vessels should be carried by the Levites, after the priests had carefully wrapped them up; and the Levites were prohibited from directly touching them, on pain of death. When, therefore, the ark of the covenant was carried in solemn procession, as in the case before us, probably uncovered, this could only be done by the priests, more especially as the Levites were not allowed to enter the Most Holy Place. Consequently, by the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>, that the priests and Levites carried them (&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;), viz., the objects mentioned before, we are to understand that the ark of the covenant was carried into the temple by the priests, and the tabernacle with its vessels by the Levites.<p>(Note: Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>, we have &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-4.htm">2 Chronicles 5:4</a>; and instead of &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm">1 Kings 8:4</a>, we have &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "the Levitical priests." These variations are to be attributed to inexactness in expression. For it is obvious that Thenius is wrong in his notion that the chronicler mentioned the Levites instead of the priests, from the simple fact that he states in <a href="/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a> that "the priests carried the ark," etc., in exact agreement with our account.)</body></html>
