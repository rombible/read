Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bethink themselves - literally, as in the margin - i. e.

The three expressions are thought to form a climax, rising from negative to positive guilt, and from mere wrongful acts to depravation of the moral character. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 8:22-61. His Prayer.<p>22. Solomon stood before the altar&#8212;This position was in the court of the people, on a brazen scaffold erected for the occasion (2Ch 6:13), fronting the altar of burnt offering, and surrounded by a mighty concourse of people. Assuming the attitude of a suppliant, kneeling (1Ki 8:54; compare 2Ch 6:24) and with uplifted hands, he performed the solemn act of consecration&#8212;an act remarkable, among other circumstances, for this, that it was done, not by the high priest or any member of the Aaronic family, but by the king in person, who might minister about, though not in, holy things. This sublime prayer [1Ki 8:22-35], which breathes sentiments of the loftiest piety blended with the deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national blessing and curse contained in the law&#8212;and the burden of it&#8212;after an ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people at the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding prayer [1Ki 8:56-61].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Heb. <span class="ital">their right</span>, against their invaders and oppressors. For they had forfeited all their rights to God only, but not to their enemies; whom though God used as scourges to chastise his people’s sins, yet they had no pretence of right to their land, nor any regard to it; but only minded the satisfaction of their own lusts and interests.

There the ‘cause’ was a righteous war undertaken at God’s direction; here the phrase implies that God shall do His people right by delivering them from their oppressors. For though God may use the heathen as His instruments He does not always approve of the conduct they exhibit. On this cf. <a href="/context/isaiah/10-5.htm" title="O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation....">Isaiah 10:5-16</a>.

An examination of this original passage, from which &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is taken and transferred to the temple, shows that the common explanations of this phrase, viz., "that this house is called after Thy name," or "that Thy name is invoked over this temple (at its dedication)," are erroneous. The name of the Lord is always used in the Scriptures to denote the working of God among His people or in His kingdom (see at <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>). The naming of this name over the nation, the temple, etc., presupposes the working of God within it, and denotes the confession and acknowledgment of that working. This is obvious from such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>, where the expression "Thy name is called over us" is only a further explanation of the word "Thou art in the midst of us;" and from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>, where "we are they over whom Thou hast not ruled from eternity" is equivalent to "over whom Thy name has not been called." The name of Jehovah will be named over the temple, when Jehovah manifests His gracious presence within it in such a manner, that the nations who pray towards it experience the working of the living God within His sanctuary. It is in this sense that it is stated in <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a> that the name of Jehovah is named above the ark of the covenant (see the Comm. in loc.). - There are no cases on record of the worship of foreigners in connection with Solomon's temple, though there are in connection with the temple built after the captivity (vid., Josephus, Ant. xi. 8, 5, that of Alexander the Great; xii. 2, 5ff., that of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus; and 2 Macc. 3:2, 3, that of Seleucus).</body></html>
