The name is supposed (by Thenius) to be properly, as in the LXX., <span class= "ital">Athanim</span>, and to signify the “month of gifts,” so called as bringing with it the gathering in of the vintage, and of the last of the crops. According to the Chaldee Targum, it was in old times the beginning of the civil, as Abib of the ecclesiastical year. The feast in this month was the Feast of Tabernacles—of all feasts of the year the most joyful—marking the gathering in of all the fruits of the land, commemorating the dwelling in tabernacles in the wilderness, and thanking God for settlement and blessing in the land (<a href="/context/leviticus/23-33.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:33-44</a>). It was, perhaps, the time when the Israelites could best be absent from their lands for a prolonged festival; but there was also a peculiar appropriateness in thus giving it a higher consecration, by celebrating on it the transference of the ark from the movable tabernacle to a fixed and splendid habitation. In this instance the festival was doubled in duration, from seven to fourteen days. (See <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.">1Kings 8:65</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1 Kings 8:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">All the men of Israel assembled — </span>Not only the chief men, who were particularly invited, but a vast number of the common people, as being desirous to see and join in this great and glorious solemnity. <span class="ital">At the feast — </span>This feast of the dedication to which Solomon had invited them. <span class="ital">In the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month — </span>This time he chose for the people’s greater convenience, because now they had gathered in all their fruits, and were going up to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.

Add to this, that Solomon chose to defer this solemnity till the next year, that he might celebrate it with the greater magnificence, that being the year of jubilee, their ninth, according to Archbishop Usher, which opened the fourth millenary of the world; and at the solemnity of the jubilee, there used to be always a vast concourse of people from all parts of the kingdom. “This ceremony” then of the dedication “began on the eighth day of the seventh month of the sacred year, which was the first of the civil year, answering to the latter end of our October, and lasted seven days, at the end of which began the feast of tabernacles.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 The bringing in the ark, is the end which must crown the work: this was done with great solemnity. The ark was fixed in the place appointed for its rest in the inner part of the house, whence they expected God to speak to them, even in the most holy place. The staves of the ark were drawn out, so as to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat over the ark, when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that they continued of use, though there was no longer occasion to carry it by them. The glory of God appearing in a cloud may signify, 1. The darkness of that dispensation, in comparison with the light of the gospel, by which, with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord. 2.

The delay, most probably, originated in Solomon's wish to choose the most fitting opportunity when there should be a general rendezvous of the people in Jerusalem (1Ki 8:2); and that was not till the next year. That was a jubilee year, and he resolved on commencing the solemn ceremonial a few days before the feast of tabernacles, which was the most appropriate of all seasons. That annual festival had been instituted in commemoration of the Israelites dwelling in booths during their stay in the wilderness, as well as of the tabernacle, which was then erected, in which God promised to meet and dwell with His people, sanctifying it with His glory. As the tabernacle was to be superseded by the temple, there was admirable propriety in choosing the feast of tabernacles as the period for dedicating the new place of worship, and praying that the same distinguished privileges might be continued to it in the manifestation of the divine presence and glory. At the time appointed for the inauguration, the king issued orders for all the heads and representatives of the nation to repair to Jerusalem and take part in the august procession [1Ki 8:1]. The lead was taken by the king and elders of the people, whose march must have been slow, as priests were stationed to offer an immense number of sacrifices at various points in the line of road through which the procession was to go. Then came the priests bearing the ark and the tabernacle&#8212;the old Mosaic tabernacle which was brought from Gibeon. Lastly, the Levites followed, carrying the vessels and ornaments belonging to the old, for lodgment in the new, house of the Lord. There was a slight deviation in this procedure from the order of march established in the wilderness (Nu 3:31; 4:15); but the spirit of the arrangement was duly observed. The ark was deposited in the oracle; that is, the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim&#8212;not the Mosaic cherubim, which were firmly attached to the ark (Ex 37:7, 8), but those made by Solomon, which were far larger and more expanded.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the men of Israel; </span> not only the chief men who were particularly invited, but a vast number of the common people, as being forward to see and to join in this great and glorious solemnity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At the feast:</span> understand either, first, The feast of tabernacles.

We know from <a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:34</a>, that the feast of tabernacles commenced on the fifteenth day of the seventh month and was held for seven days. The month Ethanim, which name only occurs here, is described as the seventh month. The name, which is connected with a word used for running water, is thought to signify ‘the rainy month.’ Josephus calls it <span class="greekheb">Θισρὶ</span>, which was the month between the new moons of October and November. If heavy rains were common at the time it was an unfortunate date for the feast of tabernacles. The ‘early rains’ spoken of in Scripture were the rains of autumn, and fell at the end of October or beginning of November, but came on very gradually. The ‘latter rains’ were those of spring, mostly in March. If the feast took place towards the middle of October it would close before the rains began to fall.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Supposing the Temple to have been dedicated as soon as possible after its completion, this festival must have been held in the twelfth year of Solomon’s reign. For in <a href="/1_kings/6-37.htm" title="In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:">1 Kings 6:37</a> we are told that the actual building was finished in the eighth month of the eleventh year.

As the "feast of ingathering" (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), as commemorating the deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>), and as peculiarly a social festival (<span class="accented">ib</span>. vers. 40-42; <a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a> sqq.), it was the most joyous as well as the greatest (▀Jos., Ant. 8:04. 1) gathering of the year. (Compare the Jewish saying of a later date: "He who has never seen the rejoicing at the pouring out of the water of Siloam, has never seen rejoicing in his life.") It was doubtless for this reason that tabernacles was selected for the dedication. A special feast of dedication, however, was held for seven days before the feast of tabernacles proper commenced (see on ver. 65). It did not displace that great feast, however (Stanley), but simply preceded it. It is worthy of notice that Jeroboam selected the same feast (<a href="/1_kings/12-32.htm">1 Kings 12:32</a>) for the inauguration of his new cultus.
