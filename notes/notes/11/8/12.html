He refers to the frequent declarations made in old time that the cloud is the symbol of God’s indwelling presence (such as <a href="/exodus/19-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.">Exodus 19:9</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>);<p>he recognises in the appearance of the cloud the sign that the Divine presence is granted to the Temple; and accordingly he exults in the proof that his foreordained work is accomplished by the building of a house, a “settled habitation” for the Lord. The description of the cloud as “thick darkness,” in no way contradicts the idea of the glory shining through it; for human eyes are easily “darkened by excess of light.” This mingled light and darkness symbolises—perhaps more strikingly than even the literal darkness of the Most Holy Place—the mystery which veils the presence of God, known to be, and to be infinitely glorious, but in its nature incomprehensible.<p>Thenius, from a single Chaldee version, suggests for “thick darkness” the correction “Jerusalem;” dwelling on the closer harmony of the reading with <a href="/1_kings/8-16.htm" title="Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.">1Kings 8:16</a>, quoting the promise of <a href="/context/psalms/132-13.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation.">Psalm 132:13-14</a> (closely connected there with the great promise of David), and urging the likelihood of the citation of this promise by Solomon, and the greater simplicity thus given to his whole utterance. The suggestion is ingenious; but it lacks authority, both external and internal. The LXX., in the Alexandrine MS. (for the Vatican MS. omits the whole), and the Vulg. agree with the Hebrew text; and Josephus, though he gives a verbose paraphrase of the prayer, evidently had our reading before him, for he contrasts the mystery and ubiquity of the Divine presence with the material shrine. Nor is it easy to conceive how from a passage so simple and prosaic, as this would be with the reading “Jerusalem,” the more difficult, but far more striking, reading of the present text could have arisen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.">1 Kings 8:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then spake Solomon — </span>Perceiving both priests and people to be struck with consternation and horror at this supernatural and sudden darkness, he uttered the words which follow, to compose their minds and comfort them. <span class="ital">The Lord said he would dwell in the thick darkness — </span>This dark cloud, therefore, is not a sign of his displeasure, as some may imagine, but rather a token of his special presence with us, and approbation of us, and that he owns this for his house, and will dwell in it, according to his declaration respecting the tabernacle, that he would <span class="ital">appear in a cloud upon the mercy-seat, </span><a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to Aaron your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat, which is on the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.">Leviticus 16:2</a>.

The latter statement is explained in <a href="/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>. "For the cherubim were spreading out wings towards the place of the ark, and so covered (lit., threw a shade) over the ark and over its poles from above." If the outspread wings of the great cherubic figures threw a shade not only over the ark of the covenant, but also over its poles, the ark was probably so placed that the poles ran from north to south, and not from east to west, as they are sketched in my Archologie.</body></html>
