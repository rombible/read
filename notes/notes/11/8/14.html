The dark dispensations of Providence should quicken us in fleeing for refuge to the hope of the gospel.

The Hebrew king was not authorized to bless the people - that was the prerogative of the priests (<a href="/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23</a>; cf. <a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a>), and he is only said to bless here as felicitating, as wishing them a blessing. Dean Stanley ] "Jewish Ch.," vol. <span class="cmt_word">2.</span> p 218) characteristically asserts that Solomon "performed the highest sacerdotal act of solemn benediction." But the same word is used in ver. 66, of the people blessing the king. "Did the <span class="accented">people</span>," as Wordsworth pertinently asks, "also perform a priestly act?"

Any one could convince himself of this, for the poles were there "to this day." The author of our books has retained this chronological allusion as he found it in his original sources; for when he composed his work, the temple was no longer standing. It is impossible, however, to ascertain from this statement how the heads of the poles could be seen in the Holy Place, - whether from the fact that they reached the curtain and formed elevations therein, if the poles ran from front to back; or whether, if, as is more probable, they ran from south to north, the front heads were to be seen, simply when the curtain was drawn back.<p>(Note: The proof which Thenius has endeavoured to give by means of a drawing of the correctness of the latter view, is founded upon untenable assumptions (see Bttcher, Aehrenl. ii. p. 69). It by no means follows from the expression &#1491;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; that the heads of the poles were visible as far off as the door of the Holy Place, but simply that they could be seen in the Holy Place, though not outside.)</body></html>
