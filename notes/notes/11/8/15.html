It is remarkable that in quoting it, David twice (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm" title="But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.">1Chronicles 22:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>) adds to it the instructive reason for the prohibition, that (unlike Solomon the Peaceful) he had “shed blood abundantly, and had made great wars.” With much grace of filial piety, Solomon refrains from mention of that reason, though there seems to be some allusion to it in his words to Hiram (<a href="/1_kings/5-3.htm" title="You know how that David my father could not build an house to the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.">1Kings 5:3</a>).

The intention of this remark is also simply to show that the law, which enjoined that the ark should merely preserve the stone tables of the covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>), had not been departed from in the lapse of time. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; is not a pronoun, but a conjunction: when, from the time that, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a>, etc. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; without &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, signifying the conclusion of a covenant, as in <a href="/1_samuel/20-16.htm">1 Samuel 20:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>, etc. Horeb, the general name for the place where the law was given, instead of the more definite name Sinai, as in Deuteronomy (see the Comm. on <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1-2</a>).<p>(Note: The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, to the effect that the pot of manna and Aaron's rod that budded were also to be found in the ark, which is at variance with this verse, and which the earlier commentators endeavoured to bring into harmony with it by forced methods of different kinds, simply rests upon an erroneous interpretation of &#1492;&#1506;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33-34</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>, which had become traditional among the Jews; since this merely affirms that the objects mentioned had been deposited in front of the testimony, i.e., in front of the ark which contained the testimony, and not within it, as the Jews supposed. - Still less are De Wette and others warranted in deducing from this verse an argument against the existence of the Mosaic book of the law in the time of Solomon, inasmuch as, according to the precept in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>, the book of the law was not to be kept in the ark, but by the side of it, or near it.)</body></html>
