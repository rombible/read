Reader, is this thy practice?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:22-53 In this excellent prayer, Solomon does as we should do in every prayer; he gives glory to God. Fresh experiences of the truth of God's promises call for larger praises. He sues for grace and favour from God. The experiences we have of God's performing his promises, should encourage us to depend upon them, and to plead them with him; and those who expect further mercies, must be thankful for former mercies. God's promises must be the guide of our desires, and the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. The sacrifices, the incense, and the whole service of the temple, were all typical of the Redeemer's offices, oblation, and intercession. The temple, therefore, was continually to be remembered. Under one word, forgive, Solomon expressed all that he could ask in behalf of his people. For, as all misery springs from sin, forgiveness of sin prepares the way for the removal of every evil, and the receiving of every good. Without it, no deliverance can prove a blessing. In addition to the teaching of the word of God, Solomon entreated the Lord himself to teach the people to profit by all, even by their chastisements. They shall know every man the plague of his own heart, what it is that pains him; and shall spread their hands in prayer toward this house; whether the trouble be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own hearts; our in-dwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases: every true Israelite endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them, and watch against the risings of them. These drive him to his knees; lamenting these, he spreads forth his hands in prayer. After many particulars, Solomon concludes with the general request, that God would hearken to his praying people. No place, now, under the gospel, can add to the prayers made in or towards it. The substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his name, it shall be given us. In this manner the Israel of God is established and sanctified, the backslider is recovered and healed. In this manner the stranger is brought nigh, the mourner is comforted, the name of God is glorified. Sin is the cause of all our troubles; repentance and forgiveness lead to all human happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Know every man the plague of his own heart - i. e. perceive one's sinfulness, or recognize one's sufferings as divine chastisements, and sin as their cause. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 8:22-61. His Prayer.<p>22. Solomon stood before the altar&#8212;This position was in the court of the people, on a brazen scaffold erected for the occasion (2Ch 6:13), fronting the altar of burnt offering, and surrounded by a mighty concourse of people. Assuming the attitude of a suppliant, kneeling (1Ki 8:54; compare 2Ch 6:24) and with uplifted hands, he performed the solemn act of consecration&#8212;an act remarkable, among other circumstances, for this, that it was done, not by the high priest or any member of the Aaronic family, but by the king in person, who might minister about, though not in, holy things. This sublime prayer [1Ki 8:22-35], which breathes sentiments of the loftiest piety blended with the deepest humility, naturally bore a reference to the national blessing and curse contained in the law&#8212;and the burden of it&#8212;after an ascription of praise to the Lord for the bestowment of the former, was an earnest supplication for deliverance from the latter. He specifies seven cases in which the merciful interposition of God would be required; and he earnestly bespeaks it on the condition of people praying towards that holy place. The blessing addressed to the people at the close is substantially a brief recapitulation of the preceding prayer [1Ki 8:56-61].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The plague of his own heart, </span> i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The following clause, "upon the place of which Thou hast said, My name shall be there" (namely, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>, implicite), contains within itself the ground upon which the prayer rests. Because the name of God will be in the temple, i.e., because God will manifest His gracious presence there, He will also keep His eyes open upon it, so as to hear the prayer of Solomon directed towards it. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500; (toward this place): because Solomon also was prayer in the court towards the temple. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>, "and hear the supplication of Thy servant and of Thy people Israel," he begins by asking that those prayers may be heard which the king and people shall henceforth bring before God in the temple. &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; corresponds to &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>, and is more precisely defined by the following &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (as for these prayers), Thou wilt hear them up to the place of Thine abode, to heaven. &#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; is a pregnant expression: to hear the prayer, which ascends to heaven. In the Chronicles we find throughout the explanatory &#1502;&#1503;. The last words, "hear and forgive," must be left in their general form, and not limited by anything to be supplied. Nothing but forgiveness of sin can remove the curse by which transgression is followed.<p>This general prayer is then particularized from <a href="/1_kings/8-31.htm">1 Kings 8:31</a> onwards by the introduction of seven special petitions for an answer in the different cases in which, in future, prayers may be offered to God in the temple. The first prayer (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-31.htm">1 Kings 8:31</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-32.htm">1 Kings 8:32</a>) has reference to the oaths sworn in the temple, the sanctity of which God is asked to protect. "If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him, to cause him to swear, and he come (and) swear before the altar in this house, then wilt Thou hear," etc. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; does not mean either "granted that" (Thenius) or "just when" (Ewald, 533, a.), although &#1488;&#1501; is used in the Chronicles, and we might render it freely "when;" but &#1488;&#1514; is simply an accusative particle, serving to introduce the following clause, in the sense of "as for," or "with regard to (such a case as) that a man sins" (vid., Ewald, 277, a.). &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; cannot be taken as anything but an asyndeton. For if &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; were a substantive, it would have the article (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;) provided it were the subject, and the verb would be written &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;; and if it were the object, we should have &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, as in <a href="/nehemiah/10-30.htm">Nehemiah 10:30</a> (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>). The prayer refers to the cases mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-6.htm">Exodus 22:6-12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, when property entrusted to any one had been lost or injured, or when a thing had been found and the finding was denied, or when an act of fraud had been committed; in which cases the law required not only compensation with the addition of a fifth of its value, but also a trespass-offering as an expiation of the sin committed by taking a false oath. But as this punishment could only be inflicted when the guilty person afterwards confessed his guilt, many false oaths might have been sworn in the cases in question and have remained unpunished, so far as men were concerned. Solomon therefore prays that the Lord will hear every such oath that shall have been sworn before the altar, and work (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;), i.e., actively interpose, and judge His servants, to punish the guilty and justify the innocent. The construction &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-32.htm">1 Kings 8:32</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-34.htm">1 Kings 8:34</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-36.htm">1 Kings 8:36</a>, etc.) can be explained more simply from the adverbial use of the accusative (Ewald, 300, b.), than from &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500; in <a href="/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493; &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;, to give (bring) his way upon his head, i.e., to cause the merited punishment to fall upon him (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/9-10.htm">Ezekiel 9:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-21.htm">Ezekiel 11:21</a>, etc.). &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1506; and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1492;&#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; recall <a href="/deuteronomy/25-2.htm">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>.
