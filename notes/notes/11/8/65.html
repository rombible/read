Evidently it extended at this time beyond Damascus.<p><span class= "bld">The river of Egypt </span>is not, as might naturally be thought, the Nile, or any of its branches; for the word used signifies rather a “brook” or “torrent,” and the torrent, described in <a href="/numbers/34-5.htm" title="And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.">Numbers 34:5</a> and <a href="/joshua/15-4.htm" title="From there it passed toward Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.">Joshua 15:4</a> as the border of Israel, is identified by all authorities with the torrent falling into the sea at El-Arish.<p>(65, 66) <span class= "bld">Seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.

Hence it is clear that the festival week of the Dedication preceded the regular feast; and the day of dismissal was the “eighth day,” regularly so-called, of the close of the Feast of Tabernacles.<p><span class= "bld">Unto their tents.</span>—The old memory of the wandering life of Israel still lingers in this expression, as in the well-known phrase “To your tents, O Israel!” (<a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>.) It may have been suggested to the writer in this place by the ideas symbolised in the Feast of Tabernacles, of which he had just recorded the observance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days....">1 Kings 8:65-66</a></span>. <span class="ital">At that time Solomon held a feast — </span>That is, kept a solemn festival. <span class="ital">And all Israel from Hamath unto the river of Egypt — </span>The usual and known bounds of the land, in the utmost length of it, <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm" title="From mount Hor you shall point out your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm" title="And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="/judges/3-3.htm" title="Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.">Jdg 3:3</a>. <span class="ital">Before the Lord — </span>Before the temple, as in God’s presence. <span class="ital">Seven days and seven days — </span>Seven for the dedication of the temple, or altar; and the other seven for the feast of tabernacles.

In this spirit should we go home from holy ordinances, and should rejoice for God’s goodness to our Lord Jesus, of whom David his servant was a type, in the advancement and establishment of his throne, pursuant to the covenant of redemption; and to all believers, his spiritual Israel, in their sanctification and consolation, pursuant to the covenant of grace.
