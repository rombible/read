Then spake Solomon, "Jehovah hath spoken to dwell in the darkness." "Solomon saw that the temple was filled with a cloud, and remembered that God had been pleased to appear in a cloud in the tent of Moses also. Hence he assuredly believed that God was in this cloud also, and that, as formerly He had filled the tabernacle, so He would now fill the temple and dwell therein" (Seb. Schmidt). &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, which Thenius still renders incorrectly, "the Lord intends to dwell in the darkness," refers, as Rashi, C. a Lap., and others have seen, to the utterances of God in the Pentateuch concerning the manifestation of His gracious presence among His people, not merely to <a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a> (I will appear in the cloud), but also to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, where the Lord said to Moses, "I come to thee &#1492;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;," and still more to <a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a>, according to which God came down upon Sinai &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500;. Solomon took the word &#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500; from these passages. That he meant by this the black, dark cloud which filled the temple, is perfectly obvious from the combination &#1493;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1504;&#1503; in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>.<p>(Note: Thenius, however, has built up all kinds of untenable conjectures as to alterations of the text, upon the erroneous assumption that &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; means the light and radiant cloud, and cannot be synonymous with &#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500;. Bttcher adopts the same opinion, without taking any notice of the striking remarks of Bertheau on <a href="/2_chronicles/5-14.htm">2 Chronicles 5:14</a>.)<p>Solomon saw this word of Jehovah realized in the filling of the temple with the cloud, and learned therefrom that the Lord would dwell in this temple. Hence, being firmly convinced of the presence of Jehovah in the cloud which filled the sanctuary, he adds in <a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a> : "I have built Thee a house to dwell in, a place for Thy seat for ever." We are not to understand &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; as signifying that Solomon believed that the temple built by him would stand for ever; but it is to be explained partly from the contrast to the previous abode of God in the tabernacle, which from the very nature of the case could only be a temporary one, inasmuch as a tent, such as the tabernacle was, is not only a moveable and provisional dwelling, but also a very perishable one, and partly from the promise given to David in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-16</a>, that the Lord would establish the throne of his kingdom for his seed for ever. This promise involved the eternal duration of the gracious connection between God and Israel, which was embodied in the dwelling of God in the temple. This connection, from its very nature, was an eternal one; even if the earthly form, from which Solomon at that moment abstracted himself, was temporal and perishable. - Solomon had spoken these words with his face turned to the Most Holy Place. He then (<a href="/1_kings/8-14.htm">1 Kings 8:14</a>) turned his face to the congregation, which was standing in the court, and blessed it. The word "blessed" (&#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498;) denotes the wish for a blessing with which the king greeted the assembled congregation, and introduced the praise of God which follows. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-15.htm">1 Kings 8:15-21</a> he praises the Lord for having now fulfilled with His hand what He spake with His mouth to his father David (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>).</body></html>
