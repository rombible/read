Much explanation of it has been wasted through misunderstanding of the real difficulty involved. It is comparatively easy to conceive how such a mass of victims could be brought as offerings or consumed, when we consider the vastness of the assembled multitude from the whole of the great dominions of Solomon, dwelling in or encamped about the city. Even at the Passovers of the last days of Jerusalem the multitude of worshippers seems to have been numbered by hundreds of thousands. The real difficulty is to conceive how, even through the fourteen days of the festival, and over the whole of the hallowed portion of the court, the victims could have been offered. But it is not unlikely that on such an occasion it might be deemed sufficient actually to sacrifice only certain representative victims of each hecatomb, and simply to dedicate the rest to the Lord, leaving them to be killed and eaten elsewhere.<p>This profusion of sacrifices, good as expressing the natural desire of all to offer at such a time, may perhaps have involved something of the idea, so frequent in heathen sacrifice, and so emphatically condemned by the prophets, that the Lord would be “pleased with thousands of rams and ten thousands of rivers of oil”—something also of that display of the magnificence of the king and his people, even in the very act of homage to God, which the history throughout seems to imply. If so, in these ideas lurked the evils which hereafter were to overthrow the prosperity of Israel, and make the Temple a heap of stones.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm" title="And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep.

The fat and certain internal portions of the victim are to be consumed in the fire on the altar, but all else is to go for food. This explains in part the enormous number of animals mentioned in this verse. Not only among the Jews, but among all ancient nations, sacrifices were feasts, sometimes on a very large scale. Homer supplies abundant instances. The dedication of the Temple was an event for which all who could come were sure to assemble, and for the support of such an enormous crowd for fourteen days (cf. <a href="/context/2_chronicles/7-8.htm" title="Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt....">2 Chronicles 7:8-9</a>) the supply here mentioned need not be thought excessive. Great multitudes can assemble in Eastern climates, where the shelter of a roof at night is not a necessity, with less preparation, except for actual food, than is required in western lands. Josephus says “all the Hebrews feasted with their wives and children, moreover also the king celebrated the feast which is called the feast of Tabernacles grandly and magnificently before the Temple, feasting together with all the people.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">two and twenty thousand oxen</span>] Contrary to his custom Josephus gives here a smaller number than that in the Hebrew text. He says twelve thousand oxen, but keeps the same number, one hundred and twenty thousand, for the sheep. Though it be said that the king offered this large sacrifice, we need not suppose that any great part of the offering was performed by him personally or in his presence. The next verse shows that provision was made for offering sacrifices in other places than on the brazen altar, viz. on temporary altars set up for the occasion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon offered a sacrifice</span> [Solomon is mentioned as chief donor, and as the executive.

This was especially the sacrifice of praise - it is called "the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings," <span class="accented">ib</span>. vers. 13, 15. See Bahr, Symb. 2:368 sqq. In the peace offering, the fat was burnt on the altar, but the flesh was eaten (ver. 15; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>), so that this form of offering was, in every way, adapted to a festival. The idea that "ox after ox, to the number of 22,000, and sheep after sheep, to the number of 120,000, were <span class="accented">consumed</span>," <span class="accented">sc</span>. by fire (Stanley), is expressly excluded], <span class="cmt_word">which he offered unto the Lord,</span>  <span class="cmt_word">two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep.</span> [it is very possible that these numbers have been altered in course of transcription, as is the case with numbers elsewhere, but there is no ground for suspecting exaggeration or mistake. For, in the first place, the Chronicles and all the Versions agree with the text, and, secondly, the numbers, compared with what we know of the sacrifices offered on other occasions, are not unduly large, nor were they such that (as has been alleged) it would be impossible to offer them within the time specified. If, at an ordinary Passover a quarter of a million of lambs could be sacrificed within the space of two or three hours (Jos., Bell. Jud. 6:09.8), there can obviously have been "no difficulty in sacrificing 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep on each of the seven days of the festival" (Keil). (But were not the sacrifices spread over fourteen days? ver. 65.) And it is to be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "profusion was a usual feature of the sacrifices of antiquity Sacrifices of a thousand oxen (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) were not infrequent. According to an Arabian historian (Koto beddyn), the Caliph Moktader sacrificed during his pilgrimage to Mecca...  40,000 camels and cows and 50,000 sheep. Tavernier speaks of 100,000 victims as offered by the King of Tonquin" (Rawlinson, Stanley); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the context insists on the ex traordinary number of victims. They were so numerous, we are told, that the brazen altar was quite inadequate to receive them (ver. 64). It has been already pointed out (note on ver. 62) that the people joined the king in the sacrifices. Indeed it is against not only ver. 62, but vers. 63, 65, to suppose that all the victims were offered by Solomon alone (Ewald, Stanley). If these numbers, therefore, include those offered by the people, we can the more readily understand them. For, by the lowest computation, there could hardly be less than 100,000 heads of houses present at the feast (Bahr, Keil), and if the numbers of David's census (<a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) may be trusted, there may very well have been four or five times that number, and on such an occasion as that, an occasion altogether without precedent, every Israelite would doubtless offer his sacrifice of thanksgiving - the more so as a large number of victims would be required for the purposes of the subsequent feast. And as to the impossibility of the priests offering so prodigious a number within the specified time (Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>.), we have only to remember <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that if there were 38,000 Levites (men over thirty years of age) in the time of David (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>), or any thing like that number, there <span class="accented">must</span> have been at the very least at this period two or three thousand priests (Keil), and we can hardly think that at the dedication of so glorious a temple, in which they were so profoundly interested, many of them would be absent from Jerusalem. But if there were only <span class="accented">one</span> thousand present, that number would have been amply sufficient to perform all the priestly functions. For it was no necessary, part of the priests' office either to slay the victim, or to prepare it for sacrifice - <span class="accented">that</span> any Israelite might do (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5, 6, 11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8</a>, etc.); the duty of the priest was strictly limited to "sprinkling the blood round about upon the altar" (<a href="/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8</a>; cf. 1:5), and burning the fat, the kidneys, etc., upon the altar (<a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>). It is clear, consequently, that there is no difficulty whatsoever as to the manual acts required of the priests. It only remains to notice one other objection, viz., that the people could not possibly have eaten all the flesh of these peace offerings. But here again the answer is conclusive, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it was not necessary that all should be eaten, for the law expressly provided that if any of the flesh remained over until the third day, it should be burnt with fire (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-6.htm">Leviticus 19:6</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> no one can say what the number of people may not have been (see below on ver. 65), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the sacrifices were spread over fourteen days.] <span class="cmt_word">So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The praise of Jehovah rests, so far as the first part is concerned, upon the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9-10</a>, and upon its fulfilment in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44-45</a> and <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>; and the second part is founded upon <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where the "good word, which the Lord spake by Moses," is more precisely described as the blessing which the Lord had promised to His people and had hitherto bestowed upon them. He had already given Israel rest by means of Joshua when the land of Canaan was taken; but since many parts of the land still remained in the hands of the Canaanites, this rest was only fully secured to them by David's victories over all their enemies. This glorious fulfilment warranted the hope that the Lord would also fulfil in the future what He had promised His servant David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a>), if the people themselves would only faithfully adhere to their God. Solomon therefore sums up all his wishes for the good of the kingdom in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-57.htm">1 Kings 8:57-61</a> in the words, "May Jehovah our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He not leave us nor forsake us, to incline our heart to Himself, that we may walk in all His ways," etc. - that the evil words predicted by Moses in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>, may not fall upon us.
