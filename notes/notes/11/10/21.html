Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Solomon's throne, as described, is certainly grander than any of which we have a representation, either in Assyria or Egypt.

This immense quantity of gold is quite paralleled in the accounts of profane writers. "Sardanapalus, when Nineveh was besieged, had 150 golden bedsteads, 150 golden tables, a million talents of gold, ten times as much silver, etc. (Ctesias, ap. Athenaeus, 12. p. 29).

The Marg., "there was no silver in them," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they were unalloyed, is a misapprehension of the true meaning]: <span class="cmt_word">it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon's Wealth and the Use He Made of It (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-13.htm">2 Chronicles 9:13-21</a>). - <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>. The gold which Solomon received in one year amounted to 666 talents, - more than seventeen million thalers (two million and a half sterling - Tr.). 666 is evidently a round number founded upon an approximative valuation. &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; is rendered in the Vulg. per annos singulos; but this is hardly correct, as the Ophir fleet, the produce of which is at any rate included, did not arrive every year, but once in three years. Thenius is wrong in supposing that this revenue merely applies to the direct taxes levied upon the Israelites. It includes all the branches of Solomon's revenue, whether derived from his commerce by sea and land (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>, <a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>) or from the royal domains (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-26.htm">1 Chronicles 27:26-31</a>), or received in the form of presents from foreign princes, who either visited him like the queen of Saba or sent ambassadors to him (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23</a>, <a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>), excepting the duties and tribute from conquered kings, which are specially mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>.   &#1492;&#1514; &#1502;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;, beside what came in (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;) from the travelling traders and the commerce of the merchants, and from all the kings, etc. &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (a combination resembling our merchantmen; cf. Ewald, 287, e., p. 721) are probably the tradesmen or smaller dealers who travelled about in the country, and &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; the wholesale dealers. This explanation of &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be rendered doubtful by the objection that &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; only occurs elsewhere in connection with the wandering about of spies; for &#1512;&#1499;&#1500; signified originally to go about, spy out, or retail scandal, and after that to trade, and go about as a tradesman. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497; are not kings of the auxiliary and allied nations (Chald., Ges.), but kings of the mixed population, and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>, more especially of the population of Arabia Deserta (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;), which bordered upon Palestine; for &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; rof is a mixed crowd of all kinds of men, who either attach themselves to a nation (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), or live in the midst of it as foreigners (<a href="/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>), hence a number of mercenaries (<a href="/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-14.htm">2 Chronicles 9:14</a>, &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; is therefore correctly explained by the term &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, which does not mean the whole of Arabia, but "only a tract of country not very extensive on the east and south of Palestine" (Gesenius), as these tribes were tributary of Solomon. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, the governors of the land, are probably the officers named in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7-19</a>. As they collected the duties in the form of natural productions and delivered them in that form, so also did the tradesmen and merchants pay their duties, and the subjugated pastoral tribes of Arabia their tribute, in natura. This explains in a very simple manner why these revenues are separated from the revenue of Solomon which came in the form of money. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; is a foreign word, which first found its way into the Hebrew language after the times of the Assyrians, and sprang from the Sanscrit paksha, a companion or friend, which took the form of pakkha in Prakrit, and probably of pakha in the early Persian (vid., Benfey and Stern, die Monatsnamen, p. 195). </body></html>
