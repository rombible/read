(<span class= "ital">a</span>) The ordinary talent of gold contained 100 “manehs,” or “portions” (the Greek <span class= "ital">mna</span>, or <span class= "ital">mina</span>), and each maneh (as is seen by comparing <a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm" title="And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.">1Kings 10:17</a> with <a href="/2_chronicles/9-16.htm" title="And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.">2Chronicles 9:16</a>) contained 100 shekels of gold. According to Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant. xiv.</span> 7, 1), each maneh contained 2½ Roman pounds, and the talent, therefore, 250 Roman pounds, or 1,262,500 grains; and this agrees fairly with his computation elsewhere (<span class= "ital">Ant. iii.</span> 8, 10), that the gold shekel was equivalent to the <span class= "ital">daric</span>, which is about 129 grains. (See <span class= "ital">Dictionary</span> <span class= "ital">of the Bible</span>: “WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.”) According to this calculation, 666 talents would give a weight of gold now worth £7,780,000. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) On the other hand, the talent of silver is expressly given (by comparison of <a href="/context/exodus/30-13.htm" title="This they shall give, every one that passes among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.">Exodus 30:13-15</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/38-25.htm" title="And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:">Exodus 38:25-28</a>) at 3,000 “shekels of the sanctuary,” and such a shekel appears, by the extant Maccabæan coins, to be about 220 grains. Of such talents, 666 would give a little more than half the former weight; hence, if the talent of gold here be supposed to be in weight the same as the talent of silver, the whole would give a weight of gold now worth about £4,000,000. Considering that this is expressly stated to be independent of certain customs and tributes, the smaller sum seems more probable; in any case, the amount is surprisingly large. But it should be remembered that at certain times and places accumulations of gold have taken place, so great as practically to reduce its value, and lead to its employment, not as a currency, but as a precious ornament. Making all allowance for exaggeration, this must have been the case among the Mexicans and Peruvians before the Spanish conquests. It is not improbable that the same may have occurred in the time of Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm" title="Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred three score and six talents of gold,">1 Kings 10:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now the weight of gold, </span>&c. — The history of the queen of Sheba being ended, the writer returns to give an account of Solomon’s riches and magnificence, which he had begun to set forth before.

Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Six hundred threescore and six talents of gold - About 3,646, 350 of our money.

The sources whence this was derived are not mentioned; nor was it the full amount of his revenue; for this was "Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country." The great encouragement he gave to commerce was the means of enriching his royal treasury. By the fortifications which he erected in various parts of his kingdom, (particularly at such places as Thapsacus, one of the passages of Euphrates, and at Tadmor, in the Syrian desert), he gave complete security to the caravan trade from the depredations of the Arab marauders; and it was reasonable that, in return for this protection, he should exact a certain toll or duty for the importation of foreign goods. A considerable revenue, too, would arise from the use of the store cities and khans he built; and it is not improbable that those cities were emporia, where the caravan merchants unloaded their bales of spices and other commodities and sold them to the king's factors, who, according to the modern practice in the East, retailed them in the Western markets at a profit. "The revenue derived from the tributary kings and from the governors of the country" must have consisted in the tribute which all inferior magistrates periodically bring to their sovereigns in the East, in the shape of presents of the produce of their respective provinces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which amounts to about two millions of our money.

It is possible, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the number of the beast is a reminiscence of this number of talents. For we may surely see in this statement of Solomon's prodigious wealth an indication of his worldliness, the turning point, perhaps, in his estrangement from God. "The love of money" may have been the root of all his evil. It is certainly remarkable that from this time forward his career is one of steady declension. It is also remarkable that while he is here represented to us as a "royal merchant," the mark of the beast is on the <span class="accented">buyers</span> and <span class="accented">sellers</span> (<a href="/revelation/13-17.htm">Revelation 13:17</a>). But see "Expositor," May, 1881. It is, of course, possible that the number has been corrupted, but, on the other hand, it may have been recorded, partly because of the singularity of the sum total. The 666 talents include the receipts from all sources - taxes, tribute, and voyages - with the exception made presently (ver. 15). Rawlinson quotes Keil (in his earlier edition) as estimating this amount at &pound;3,646,350. But in his later work, Keil puts it in round numbers at two and a half millions (17,000,000 thalers), while Mr. Peele calculates it at about &pound;8,000,000. These widely varying figures are instructive, as showing that both estimates are little more than guesswork. We do not know the value of the Hebrew talent, nor, indeed, can it ever be rightly appraised until we know its purchasing power. The <span class="accented">denarius, e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, is generally valued at 8&frac12; d. (or 7&frac12; d.) because it contained some 58 grains of pure silver but its real <span class="accented">value</span> was nearer three shillings, inasmuch as it was a fair wage for a day's work on the land (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>). In any case, it is clear that this sum should hardly be compared with the <span class="accented">annual</span> revenue of other Oriental empires, as by Rawlinson (see above). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>She then said with astonishment to Solomon, that of what her eyes now saw she had not heard the half, through the report which had reached her of his affairs and of his wisdom, and which had hitherto appeared incredible to her; and not only congratulated his servants, who stood continually near him and could hear his wisdom, but also praised Jehovah his God, that out of His eternal love to His people Israel He had given them a king to do justice and righteousness. The earlier theologians inferred from this praising of Jehovah, which involved faith in the true God, when taken in connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, that this queen had been converted to the true God, and conversed with Solomon on religious matters. But, as we have already observed at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>, an acknowledgment of Jehovah as the God of Israel was reconcilable with polytheism. And the fact that nothing is said about her offering sacrifice in the temple, shows that the conversion of the queen is not to be thought of here.</body></html>
