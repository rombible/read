If the reading of the Hebrew text is to stand, the sense appears to be, “And Solomon’s horses were brought from Egypt; a troop of the king’s merchants obtained a troop (of horses) at a fixed price.” The horses were brought up (that is) in caravans from the plains of Egypt, where they abounded (see <a href="/genesis/47-17.htm" title="And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.">Genesis 47:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm" title="Behold, the hand of the LORD is on your cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.">Exodus 9:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-9.htm" title="But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.">Exodus 14:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-9.htm" title="How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?">Isaiah 36:9</a>), although from their not being represented on the monuments before the eighteenth dynasty it is thought they were introduced from abroad, perhaps by the <span class= "ital">Hyksos</span>, or shepherd kings. But the LXX. has a remarkable various reading “and from Tekoa” (from which the Vulg. <span class= "ital">et de Coa</span>, probably comes), according to which the passage runs very simply: “And Solomon’s horses were brought from Egypt; and from Tekoa the king’s merchants,” &c. Tekoa lay on the hills to the east of Hebron, not far from Bethlehem, and might well be an emporium for caravans from Egypt. The parallel passages of <a href="/context/2_chronicles/1-16.htm" title="And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.">2Chronicles 1:16-17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-28.htm" title="And they brought to Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.">2Chronicles 9:28</a>, give us no help, for the former is exactly the same as this, and the latter runs thus: “And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt and out of all lands.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:14-29 Solomon increased his wealth. Silver was nothing accounted of. Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our esteem of all earthly possessions. If gold in abundance makes silver to be despised, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make gold to be lightly esteemed? See in Solomon's greatness the performance of God's promise, and let it encourage us to seek first the righteousness of God's kingdom. This was he, who, having tasted all earthly enjoyments, wrote a book, to show the vanity of all worldly things, the vexation of spirit that attends them, and the folly of setting our hearts upon them: and to recommend serious godliness, as that which will do unspeakably more to make us happy, that all the wealth and power he was master of; and, through the grace of God, it is within our reach.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word translated "linen yarn" is thought now by Hebraists to mean "a troop" or "company." If the present reading is retained, they would translate the passage - "As for the bringing up of Solomon's horses out of Egypt, a band of the king's merchants fetched a band (or troop) of horses at a price." But the reading is very uncertain. The Septuagint had before them a different one, which they render "and from Tekoa." Tekoa, the home of Amos Amo 1:1, was a small town on the route from Egypt to Jerusalem, through which the horses would have naturally passed. The monuments of the 18th and of later dynasties make it clear that the horse, though introduced from abroad, became very abundant in Egypt. During the whole period of Egyptian prosperity the corps of chariots constituted a large and effective portion of the army. That horses were abundant in Egypt at the time of the Exodus is evident from <a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23</a>, <a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>. That they continued numerous in later times appears from frequent allusions, both in the Historical Books of Scripture and in the prophets, as <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-24.htm">2 Kings 18:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>, etc. The monuments show that the horse was employed by the Egyptians in peace no less than in war, private persons being often represented as paying visits to their friends in chariots. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26-29.&#8212;(See on [309]2Ch 1:14 [and [310]2Ch 9:25].)   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Horses and linen yarn; </span> the two chief commodities of Egypt.

But the literal rendering is ‘and the export of horses which was to Solomon (was) from Egypt;’ and this the R.V. represents by <span class="bld">And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and linen yarn</span>] The word (<span class="greekheb">מקוה</span>) <span class="ital">mikveh</span> so translated, is derived from a verb which implies ‘a stringing together,’ and a kindred noun (<span class="greekheb">תקוה</span>) <span class="ital">tikvah</span>, is used (<a href="/joshua/2-18.htm" title="Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall bring your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household, home to you.">Joshua 2:18</a>) for the <span class="ital">line</span> of scarlet cord which Rahab was ordered to bind in her window. From this connexion the rendering of the A.V. is derived. But the word in the text is used for gathering together in other senses, and here seems to be intended for ‘a <span class="ital">string</span> of horses,’ which sense the R.V. has represented by ‘a drove.’ The word occurs twice over and must have the same sense in both places of the same verse. The whole is rendered in R.V. <span class="bld">and the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price</span>. The Hebrew pointing represents the word <span class="greekheb">מקוה</span> in a form which may be considered in construction, though it need not necessarily be so. Hence some have given a double meaning to the word, referringit in the first place to the caravan of merchants, and only in the second place to the string of horses. The rendering then would be ‘And a company of the king’s merchants received a (each) drove of horses at a price.’ But it appears harsh to give two senses to the same word in the same verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What appears to be meant is that the king’s representatives dealt wholesale with the Egyptian breeders, contracting to take so many horses for a stipulated sum; afterwards they brought the droves away, and disposed of them, as retailers, and hence secured for king Solomon a considerable revenue by the profits.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Vulgate takes the word ‘Mikveh’ ‘a drove’ as being a proper name preceded by a preposition, and renders ‘and from Coa.’ The LXX. has done something of the same kind, but has taken the word as ‘Tekoa’ <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκ Θεκουέ</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</span> [This is a difficult passage, and the difficulty lies in the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, here rendered "linen yarn." Elsewhere the word signifies, a <span class="accented">congregation</span>, or <span class="accented">gathering</span>, as of water (<a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-36.htm">Leviticus 11:36</a>). Consequently, Gesenius (with Vatablus, <span class="accented">al</span>.) would here interpret, "company." "And the <span class="accented">company</span> of kings' merchants took the <span class="accented">company</span> (of horses) at a price." The great difficulty in the way of this interpretation is perhaps the paronomasia, which, though not altogether without precedent, would be formal and unusual in grave history. Somewhat similarly Bahr: "and as to horses... and their collection, the merchants of the king made a collection for a certain price," but this again is strained and artificial. Perhaps it is safer to see in the word the name of a place. The LXX. (similarly the Vulgate) renders, "from Egypt <span class="accented">and from Thekoa</span>," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, which Keil, however, contends is manifestly a variation of an older reading, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">from</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;</span>." As to Koa or Kova, it is objected that no such place is mentioned elsewhere, and it is alleged that if it were a market for horses, or even if it were a frontier station, where the duties on horses were collected, we should surely have heard of it again. But this is by no means certain. Koa may well have been an in. significant post on the frontier which it was only necessary to mention in this connexion. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span> certainly looks like an emendation, but it is to be remembered that although Tekoa (<a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) was apparently an insignificant village, still it gave its name to a district; it was no great distance from the Egyptian frontier - it was some six Roman miles south of Bethlehem, according to Jerome (<span class="accented">in Amos</span>, Proem.), and it may have been the rendezvous of the Egyptian and Hebrew horse dealers. The text would thus yield the following meaning: "And as for the expert of Solomon's horses from Egypt and from Koa (or Tekoa), the king's merchants took them from Koa (or Tekoa) at a price." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The drinking vessels of Solomon also were all of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon of costly gold (&#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;: see at <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>).
