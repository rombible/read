The former of these, termed <span class="greekheb">יורה</span>, <span class="ital">joree, </span>quod terram quasi erudiat et informet ad producendam semen, <span class="ital">because it, as it were, instructed and taught, </span>that is, prepared, <span class="ital">the earth to bring forth the seed, </span>was the autumnal rain, and fell in the month answering to our October. The latter was termed <span class="greekheb">מלקושׁ</span>, <span class="ital">malkosh, </span>quasi collectionis pluvia, <span class="ital">the rain of reaping and ingathering, </span>because, falling about the vernal equinox, in the month answering to our March, it prepared the corn for harvest, by causing the ears to fill and ripen. Now, at the beginning of the drought, Ahab might very probably impute the want of rain to natural causes; but when, after six months, neither the former nor the latter rain fell in its season, he began to be enraged at Elijah, as the cause of this national judgment; which forced him, at God’s command, to save his life by flight. And from that time the three years here mentioned are to be computed; though from the first notice which Elijah gave to Ahab of this approaching calamity, to the expiration of it, were certainly three years and a half. During the first of the three years here referred to by the historian, Elijah was by the brook Cherith, and the two latter at Zarephath; near the end of which God took pity on the country, having fulfilled the threatening denounced by his prophet, and thereby set his seal to the truth of his word. <span class="ital">Saying, Go show thyself to Ahab — </span>It does not appear that either the miraculous increase of the provision, or the raising of the dead child, had caused Elijah to be taken notice of at Zarephath, otherwise Ahab would easily have discovered him: but now the days appointed for his concealment being finished, he is commanded to come out of his obscurity, and to show himself to the king; in consequence of which, his appearance soon became as public as before his retirement was close. <span class="ital">I will send rain on the earth — </span>According to thy word, and in answer to thy prayer. He was to acquaint Ahab with the cause of the judgment, and to advise him to remove that cause; and on that condition to promise him rain. Thus God took care to maintain the honour of his prophet, and in judgment remembered mercy to Israel, for the sake of the holy seed yet left among them, who suffered in this common calamity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-16 The severest judgments, of themselves, will not humble or change the hearts of sinners; nothing, except the blood of Jesus Christ, can atone for the guilt of sin; nothing, except the sanctifying Spirit of God, can purge away its pollution. The priests and the Levites were gone to Judah and Jerusalem, 2Ch 11:13,14, but instead of them God raised up prophets, who read and expounded the word. They probably were from the schools of the prophets, first set up by Samuel. They had not the spirit of prophecy as Elijah, but taught the people to keep close to the God of Israel. These Jezebel sought to destroy. The few that escaped death were forced to hide themselves. God has his remnant among all sorts, high and low; and that faith, fear, and love of his name, which are the fruits of the Holy Spirit, will be accepted through the Redeemer. See how wonderfully God raises up friends for his ministers and people, for their shelter in difficult times. Bread and water were now scarce, yet Obadiah will find enough for God's prophets, to keep them alive. Ahab's care was not to lose all the beasts; but he took no care about his soul, not to lose that. He took pains to seek grass, but none to seek the favour of God; fencing against the effect, but not inquiring how to remove the cause. But it bodes well with a people, when God calls his ministers to stand forth, and show themselves. And we may the better endure the bread of affliction, while our eyes see our teachers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The third year - i. e., in the third year of his sojourn with the widow.

The early rain fell in our March, the latter rain in our October. Though Ahab might have at first ridiculed Elijah's announcement, yet when neither of these rains fell in their season, he was incensed against the prophet as the cause of the national judgment, and compelled him, with God's direction, to consult his safety in flight. This was six months after the king was told there would be neither dew nor rain, and from this period the three years in this passage are computed.<p>Go, show thyself unto Ahab&#8212;The king had remained obdurate and impenitent. Another opportunity was to be given him of repentance, and Elijah was sent in order to declare to him the cause of the national judgment, and to promise him, on condition of his removing it, the immediate blessing of rain.Elijah in the extremity of famine is sent to Ahab; meeteth good Obadiah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/1_kings/18-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth....">1 Kings 18:1-7</a></span>; chargeth him to certify the king of his coming: he bringeth Ahab to him, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/1_kings/18-8.htm" title="And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here....">1 Kings 18:8-16</a></span>.

These words, in which the word also refers to the other calamities occasioned by the drought, contain no reproach of God, but are expressive of the heartiest compassion for the suffering of his benefactress and the deepest lamentation, which, springing from living faith, pours out the whole heart before God in the hour of distress, that I may appeal to Him the more powerfully for His aid. The meaning is, "Thou, O Lord my God, according to Thy grace and righteousness, canst not possibly leave the son of this widow in death." Such confident belief carries within itself the certainty of being heard. The prophet therefore proceeds at once to action, to restore the boy to life.</body></html>
