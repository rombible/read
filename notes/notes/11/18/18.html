Art thou he that troubleth Israel&#8212;A violent altercation took place. Ahab thought to awe him into submission, but the prophet boldly and undisguisedly told the king that the national calamity was traceable chiefly to his own and his family's patronage and practice of idolatry. But, while rebuking the sins, Elijah paid all due respect to the high rank of the offender. He urged the king to convene, by virtue of his royal mandate, a public assembly, in whose presence it might be solemnly decided which was the troubler of Israel. The appeal could not well be resisted, and Ahab, from whatever motives, consented to the proposal. God directed and overruled the issue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These calamities are not to be imputed to my passions, but thine and thy father’s wickedness, which God punisheth by this means.

"This boldness, this high tone, this absence of the slightest indication of alarm, seems to have completely discomfited Ahab, who ventured on no reply," etc. (Rawlinson). It is probable that, though he put on a bold front, he was from the first thoroughly cowed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And if it comes to pass (that) I go away from thee, and the Spirit of Jehovah carries thee away whither I know not, and I come to tell Ahab (sc., that thou art here) and he findeth thee not, he will slay me, and thy servant feareth the Lord from his youth," etc.; i.e., since I as a God-fearing man and a protector of the prophets cannot boast of any special favour from Ahab. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;, from my youth up: "thy servant" being equivalent to "I myself." From the fear expressed by Obadiah that the Spirit of Jehovah might suddenly carry the prophet to some unknown place, Seb. Schmidt and others have inferred that in the earlier history of Elijah there had occurred some cases of this kind of sudden transportation, though they have not been handed down; but the anxiety expressed by Obadiah might very well have sprung from the fact, that after Elijah had announced the coming drought to Ahab, he disappeared, and, notwithstanding all the inquiries instituted by the king, was nowhere to be found. And since he was not carried off miraculously then (compare the &#1500;&#1498; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, "get thee hence" and "he went," in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3</a>, <a href="/1_kings/17-5.htm">1 Kings 17:5</a>), there is all the less ground for imagining cases of this kind in the intermediate time, when he was hidden from his enemies. The subsequent translation of Elijah to heaven (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11-12</a>), and the miraculous carrying away of Philip from the chamberlain of Mauritania (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), do not warrant any such assumption; and still less the passage which Clericus quotes from Ezekiel (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>), because the carrying of Ezekiel through the air, which is mentioned here, only happened in vision and not in external reality. If Obadiah had known of any actual occurrence of this kind, he would certainly have stated it more clearly as a more striking vindication of his fear.</body></html>
