But God’s providence was greater than Ahab’s malice, and effectually secured the prophet, notwithstanding all he could do.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-16 The severest judgments, of themselves, will not humble or change the hearts of sinners; nothing, except the blood of Jesus Christ, can atone for the guilt of sin; nothing, except the sanctifying Spirit of God, can purge away its pollution. The priests and the Levites were gone to Judah and Jerusalem, 2Ch 11:13,14, but instead of them God raised up prophets, who read and expounded the word. They probably were from the schools of the prophets, first set up by Samuel. They had not the spirit of prophecy as Elijah, but taught the people to keep close to the God of Israel. These Jezebel sought to destroy. The few that escaped death were forced to hide themselves. God has his remnant among all sorts, high and low; and that faith, fear, and love of his name, which are the fruits of the Holy Spirit, will be accepted through the Redeemer. See how wonderfully God raises up friends for his ministers and people, for their shelter in difficult times. Bread and water were now scarce, yet Obadiah will find enough for God's prophets, to keep them alive. Ahab's care was not to lose all the beasts; but he took no care about his soul, not to lose that. He took pains to seek grass, but none to seek the favour of God; fencing against the effect, but not inquiring how to remove the cause. But it bodes well with a people, when God calls his ministers to stand forth, and show themselves. And we may the better endure the bread of affliction, while our eyes see our teachers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Obadiah thinks that to execute this commission will be fatal to him <a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-16. Obadiah was in the way &#8230; Elijah met him&#8212;Deeming it imprudent to rush without previous intimation into Ahab's presence, the prophet solicited Obadiah to announce his return to Ahab. The commission, with a delicate allusion to the perils he had already encountered in securing others of God's servants, was, in very touching terms, declined, as unkind and peculiarly hazardous. But Elijah having dispelled all the apprehensions entertained about the Spirit's carrying him away, Obadiah undertook to convey the prophet's message to Ahab and solicit an interview. But Ahab, bent on revenge, or impatient for the appearance of rain, went himself to meet Elijah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What have I sinned?</span> wherein have I so offended God and thee, that thou shouldst inflict this punishment upon me, and expose me to certain ruin by this means? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, what have I sinned,....

He is asked to carry a message to Ahab, which another disappearance of Elijah may make to seem untrue. He thinks in his alarm that the prophet does not know how great a friend he has been to the cause of Jehovah’s servants, and so asks why his life should be put in jeopardy who had done so much to save the lives of the prophets.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldst deliver</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">that thou art giving</span>] <span class="cmt_word">thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elijah's meeting with Ahab. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-2.htm">1 Kings 18:2</a>. In the third year of his sojourn at Zarephath the word of the Lord came to Elijah to show himself to Ahab; since God was about to send rain upon the land again. The time given, "the third year," is not to be reckoned, as the Rabbins, Clericus, Thenius, and others assume, from the commencement of the drought, but from the event last mentioned, namely, the sojourn of Elijah at Zarephath. This view merits the preference as the simplest and most natural one, and is shown to be the oldest by <a href="/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>, where Christ and James both say, that in the time of Ahab it did not rain for three years and six months. And this length of time can only be obtained by allowing more than two years for Elijah's stay at Zarephath. -  From <a href="/1_kings/18-2.htm">1 Kings 18:2</a> to <a href="/1_kings/18-6.htm">1 Kings 18:6</a> we have parenthetical remarks introduced, to explain the circumstances which led to Elijah's meeting with Ahab.

(<a href="/1_kings/18-2.htm">1 Kings 18:2</a>), and "Obadiah feared..." (<a href="/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3</a>), and are therefore to be expressed by the pluperfect. When the famine had become very severe in Samaria (the capital), Ahab, with Obadiah the governor of his castle (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, see at <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>), who was a God-fearing man, and on the persecution of the prophets of Jehovah by Jezebel had hidden a hundred prophets in caves and supplied them with food, had arranged for an expedition through the whole land to seek for hay for his horses and mules. And for this purpose they had divided the land between them, so that the one explored one district and the other another. We see from <a href="/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a> that Jezebel had resolved upon exterminating the worship of Jehovah, and sought to carry out this intention by destroying the prophets of the true God. The hundred prophets whom Obadiah concealed were probably for the most part pupils ("sons") of the prophets. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; must signify, according to the context and also according to <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>, "fifty each," so that &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; must have fallen out through a copyist's error. &#1502;&#1503; &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, that we may not be obliged to kill (a portion) of the cattle (&#1502;&#1503; partitive). The Keri &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; is no doubt actually correct, but it is not absolutely necessary, as the Chethb &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503; may be taken as an indefinite phrase: "any head of cattle." </body></html>
