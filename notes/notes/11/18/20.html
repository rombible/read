It is a long range, presenting many summits, and intersected by a number of small ravines. The spot where the contest took place is situated at the eastern extremity, which is also the highest point of the whole ridge. It is called El-Mohhraka, "the Burning," or "the Burnt Place." No spot could have been better adapted for the thousands of Israel to have stood drawn up on those gentle slopes. The rock shoots up in an almost perpendicular wall of more than two hundred feet in height, on the side of the vale of Esdraelon. This wall made it visible over the whole plain, and from all the surrounding heights, where gazing multitudes would be stationed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He complied with Elijah’s motion; partly, because it was so fair and reasonable, that he could not refuse it with honour, nor without the discontent of all his people, this being proposed in order to their deliverance from this terrible famine; partly, because the urgency of the present distress made him willing to try all means to remove it; partly, from a curiosity of seeing some extraordinary events; and principally, because God inclined his heart to close with it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel,....

His ready compliance with Elijah's request, notwithstanding the bitter hatred of the man which he had just betrayed, is easily explained. It was not so much that "he bowed before the spiritual supremacy of the prophet, which impressed him" (Bahr), as that he hoped, from his reappearance, that he was now about to speak the word (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>) and give rain upon the earth, and Ahab was willing to take any measures which would conduce with that result. It would take some days to collect the representatives of the tribes.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And if it comes to pass (that) I go away from thee, and the Spirit of Jehovah carries thee away whither I know not, and I come to tell Ahab (sc., that thou art here) and he findeth thee not, he will slay me, and thy servant feareth the Lord from his youth," etc.; i.e., since I as a God-fearing man and a protector of the prophets cannot boast of any special favour from Ahab. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;, from my youth up: "thy servant" being equivalent to "I myself." From the fear expressed by Obadiah that the Spirit of Jehovah might suddenly carry the prophet to some unknown place, Seb. Schmidt and others have inferred that in the earlier history of Elijah there had occurred some cases of this kind of sudden transportation, though they have not been handed down; but the anxiety expressed by Obadiah might very well have sprung from the fact, that after Elijah had announced the coming drought to Ahab, he disappeared, and, notwithstanding all the inquiries instituted by the king, was nowhere to be found. And since he was not carried off miraculously then (compare the &#1500;&#1498; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, "get thee hence" and "he went," in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3</a>, <a href="/1_kings/17-5.htm">1 Kings 17:5</a>), there is all the less ground for imagining cases of this kind in the intermediate time, when he was hidden from his enemies. The subsequent translation of Elijah to heaven (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11-12</a>), and the miraculous carrying away of Philip from the chamberlain of Mauritania (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), do not warrant any such assumption; and still less the passage which Clericus quotes from Ezekiel (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>), because the carrying of Ezekiel through the air, which is mentioned here, only happened in vision and not in external reality. If Obadiah had known of any actual occurrence of this kind, he would certainly have stated it more clearly as a more striking vindication of his fear.</body></html>
