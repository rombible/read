It is curiously significant of the hesitating and temporising attitude of Ahab, that, while Jezebel is suffered to persecute, a high officer in the court is able to profess openly the service of Jehovah, and secretly to thwart the cruelty of the queen. In his heart Ahab always seems to acknowledge the true God, but is overborne by the commanding and ruthless nature of Jezebel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/18-3.htm" title="And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.

This circumstance, one might have supposed, would have made Ahab discard, if not persecute him; but it is likely he found him so very useful a servant, that for his own advantage, he connived at his not worshipping Baal and the calves. But, it will be said; “How could he and some other Israelites be said to <span class="ital">fear the Lord, </span>when they did not go up to Jerusalem to worship, as God had commanded?” Although they seem not to be wholly excusable in this neglect, yet because they worshipped God in spirit and in truth, and performed all moral duties to God and their brethren, and abstained from idolatry, being kept from Jerusalem by violence, God bore with their infirmity herein.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-16 The severest judgments, of themselves, will not humble or change the hearts of sinners; nothing, except the blood of Jesus Christ, can atone for the guilt of sin; nothing, except the sanctifying Spirit of God, can purge away its pollution. The priests and the Levites were gone to Judah and Jerusalem, 2Ch 11:13,14, but instead of them God raised up prophets, who read and expounded the word. They probably were from the schools of the prophets, first set up by Samuel. They had not the spirit of prophecy as Elijah, but taught the people to keep close to the God of Israel. These Jezebel sought to destroy. The few that escaped death were forced to hide themselves. God has his remnant among all sorts, high and low; and that faith, fear, and love of his name, which are the fruits of the Holy Spirit, will be accepted through the Redeemer. See how wonderfully God raises up friends for his ministers and people, for their shelter in difficult times. Bread and water were now scarce, yet Obadiah will find enough for God's prophets, to keep them alive. Ahab's care was not to lose all the beasts; but he took no care about his soul, not to lose that. He took pains to seek grass, but none to seek the favour of God; fencing against the effect, but not inquiring how to remove the cause. But it bodes well with a people, when God calls his ministers to stand forth, and show themselves. And we may the better endure the bread of affliction, while our eyes see our teachers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Obadiah's name, "servant of Yahweh," indicates his religious character. It corresponds to the modern Arabic name Abdallah. Ahab could scarcely have been ignorant of Obadiah's faithfulness to Yahweh; and it tells in favor of the monarch's tolerance that he should have maintained an adherent of the old religion in so important an office. There seems to be no doubt that the worst deeds of Ahab's reign sprang less from his own free will and natural disposition than from the evil counsels, or rather perhaps the imperious requirements, of his wife. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Obadiah feared the Lord greatly&#8212;Although he did not follow the course taken by the Levites and the majority of pious Israelites at that time of emigration into Judah (2Ch 11:13-16), he was a secret and sincere worshipper.
