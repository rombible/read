The timber was first carried westward from the flanks of Lebanon to the nearest part of the coast, where it was collected into floats, or rafts, which were then conveyed southward along the coast to Joppa, now Jaffa, from where the land journey to Jerusalem was not more than about forty miles. A similar course was taken on the building of the second temple <a href="/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>.<p>Food for my household - The Phoenician cities had very little arable territory of their own, the mountain range of Lebanon rising rapidly behind them; and they must always have imported the chief part of their sustenance from abroad.

Probably Sidon itself would be as convenient a place as any to which to bring the timber down. We learn from Josephus (c. Apion i. 18) that Hiram was quite experienced in this work. On his accession he had done much for the adornment of Tyre, especially in its sacred buildings and it is said of him <span class="greekheb">ὕλην ξύλων ἀπελθὼν ἔκοψεν ἀπὸ τοῦ λεγομένου ὄρους Λιβάνου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κέδρινα ξύλα εἰς τὰς τῶν ἱερῶν στέγας</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθελών τε τὰ ἀρξαῖα ἱερὰ καινοὺς</span> (<span class="ital">sic</span>) <span class="greekheb">ᾠκοδόμησε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>in <span class="ital">flotes</span>] There is no preposition in the original. The idea probably would be more nearly expressed by <span class="ital">‘as</span> flotes.’ R.V. <span class="bld">I will make them into rafts to go by sea</span>. The flotes would be made of the trees fastened side by side, and formed into long raftlike structures, somewhat like those which may be seen often on the Rhine, sent down from Switzerland. Such flotes would keep close to the shore and be anchored at night. In this way they might easily be brought along the coasts of Phœnicia and the Holy Land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the place</span>] The Chronicler (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>) makes mention of the name, Joppa. This would be the most convenient port for Jerusalem, and at that point the wood was to be delivered to Solomon’s officers. The compiler of the Kings of course knew where the timber had been delivered, but as it was not recorded in his authority he made no mention of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou shalt appoint</span>] The word is not the same as that so rendered in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm" title="Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.">1 Kings 5:6</a>. The literal sense is ‘to send’ but it is often used of ‘sending a message’ without the addition of any object. Thus in <a href="/1_kings/21-11.htm" title="And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.">1 Kings 21:11</a>, ‘They did as Jezebel had sent unto them.’ Cf. <a href="/2_kings/16-11.htm" title="And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.">2 Kings 16:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou shalt accomplish my desire</span>] Josephus explains why a supply of such provisions as Solomon proposed to give would be most acceptable to the Tyrian monarch, making him say in his letter, <span class="greekheb">ὅπως δὲ καὶ σὺ παράσχῃς ἡμῖν ἀντὶ τούτων σῖτον</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὗ διὰ τὸ νῆσον οἰκεῖν δεόμεθα</span>, <span class="greekheb">φρόντισον</span>. The Tyrians were a maritime people, living on an island near a mountainous shore, and so with no chance of getting food supplies from their own land.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My servants shall bring them</span> [No word in the Hebrew; "Timber of Cedar," etc., must be supplied or understood from the preceding verse] <span class="cmt_word">down</span> [It is generally a steep descent from the cedar grove, and indeed all the Lebanon district, to the coast] <span class="cmt_word">from</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lebanon unto the sea</span> [This must have been a great undertaking. The cedars are ten hours distant from Tripoli, and the road must always have been a bad one. ("What a road it is for mortals. In some spots it seems to have been intended for mountain goats only ..... It winds up sublime glens, and zigzags up rocky acclivities, and passes over stone-strewn terraces," etc. (Porter, Handbook, p. 583.) To the writer it appeared to be the most rugged and dangerous road in Palestine. It is possible that the timber was collected and floated at Gebal (Biblus. See note on ver. 18). Beyrout, the present port of the Lebanon, is 27 hours distant <span class="accented">via Tripoli.</span> But cedars would then, no doubt, be found nearer the sea. And the ancients (as the stones of Baalbek, etc., prove) were not altogether deficient in mechanical appliances. The transport of cedars to the Mediterranean would be an easy undertaking compared with the carriage of them to Nineveh, and we know from the inscriptions that they were imported by the Assyrian kings] <span class="cmt_word">and I will convey them by se</span>a in floats [Heb.

The reader will probably have seen such rafts on the Rhine or other river] <span class="cmt_word">unto the place which</span>  <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt appoint</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">send</span>] me [In <a href="/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>, Hiram assumes that this place will be Joppa, now Yafo, the port of Jerusalem, and 40 miles distant from the Holy City. The transport over these 40 miles, also of most rugged and trying road, must have involved, if possible, a still greater toil than that from Lebanon to the sea] <span class="cmt_word">and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">do</span>, same word as in ver. 8, and probably used designedly - "I will perform thy desire.., and thou shalt perform my desire." There shall be a strict <span class="accented">quid pro quo</span>] <span class="cmt_word">my desire, in giving food for my household</span> [Hiram states in his reply in what shape he would prefer the hire promised by Solomon (ver. 6).

The fact that 20,000 ears of wheat formed a part of each has led to their being confounded (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the marginal references). It is noticeable that when the <span class="accented">second</span> temple was built, cedar wood was again brought to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">rid</span> Joppa, in return for "meat and drink and oil unto them of Zidon" (<a href="/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>). The selection of <span class="accented">food</span> as the hire of his servants by Hiram almost amounts to an undesigned coincidence. Their narrow strip of cornland, between the roots of Lebanon and the coast - Phoenicia proper ("the great plain of the city of Sidon," Josephus. Ant. 5:03, 1) is only 28 miles long, with an average breadth of one mile-compelled the importation of corn and oil. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:17) mentions wheat, honey, oil, and balm as exported from Palestine to the markets of Tyre. It has been justly remarked that the fact that Phoenicia was thus dependent upon Palestine for its breadstuffs explains the unbroken peace that prevailed between the two countries (Heeren. See Dict. Bib. if. p. 865). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon thereupon communicated to Hiram, by means of an embassy, his intention to carry out the building of the temple which his father projected, and asked him for building wood from Lebanon for the purpose. From the words, "Thou knowest that my father David could not build," etc., it is evident that David had not only been busily occupied for a long time with the plan for building a temple, but that he had already commenced negotiations with Hiram on the matter; and with this <a href="/1_chronicles/22-4.htm">1 Chronicles 22:4</a> agrees. "To the name of Jehovah:" this expression is based upon <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a> : "the place which the Lord shall choose to put His name there, or that His name may dwell there." The name of Jehovah is the manifestation of the divine nature in a visible sign as a real pledge of His presence (see at <a href="/1_kings/12-5.htm">1 Kings 12:5</a>), and not merely numen Jovae quatenus ab hominibus cognoscitur, colitur, celebratur (Winer, Thenius). Hence in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, to which Solomon refers, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>, <a href="/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>) alternates with &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>).
