In this substructure vast stones are still to be seen, and are referred by many authorities to the age of Solomon. The labour of transport must have been enormous, especially as all were worked beforehand.

And it is hardly found with the mere sense of ‘bringing’ or ‘bearing.’ Therefore in this passage and in <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm" title="Whoever removes stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that splits wood shall be endangered thereby.">Ecclesiastes 10:9</a>, the R.V. has given it (with the authority of the Targum) the meaning ‘to hew out.’ In the latter passage this rendering is certainly more appropriate and in harmony with the parallel clause, ‘Whoso <span class="ital">heweth out</span> stones shall be hurt therewith, and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.’ Here too, the sense ‘they <span class="bld">hewed out</span> great stones’ fits the passage extremely well.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">costly stones</span>] The adjective is not unfrequently used of gems which are of great price; as, of the precious stones in the crown of the Ammonite king (<a href="/2_samuel/13-30.htm" title="And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.">2 Samuel 13:30</a>). But in the present case the costly nature was due to the care and pains which had been taken in selecting and working these foundation stones. This seems to be the sense in such passages as <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>, where the worth consists in the stability and tried nature of the stone spoken of.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and <span class="ital">hewed stones</span>] As will be seen from the A. V. there is no conjunction expressed in the original. The rendering however which is given leads the reader to suppose that there stands another adjective in the Hebrew like those rendered ‘great’ and ‘costly.’ This is not so, and moreover the order of the words makes it clear that the words rendered ‘hewed stones’ should follow ‘to lay the foundation of the house.’ Hence the R.V. has <span class="bld">to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king commanded and they brought</span> [or <span class="accented">cut out, quarried</span> (Gesen.), as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:9</a>; see also ch. 6:7 (Heb.) ] <span class="cmt_word">great stones, costly</span> [precious, not <span class="accented">heavy</span>, as Thenius.

We learn from <a href="/1_kings/7-10.htm">1 Kings 7:10</a> that the stones of the foundation of the <span class="accented">palace</span> were squared to 8 cubits and 10 cubits] <span class="cmt_word">to lay the foundation of the house.</span> [Some of these great squared stones, we can hardly doubt, are found <span class="accented">in situ</span> at the present day. The stones at the south-east angle of the walls of the Haram (Mosque of Omar) are "unquestionably of Jewish masonry" (Porter, Handbook, p. 115). "One is 23 2:9 in. long; whilst others vary from 17 to 20 feet in length. Five courses of them are nearly entire" (<span class="accented">ib.</span>) As Herod, in rebuilding the edifice, would seem to have had nothing to do with the foundations, we may safely connect these huge blocks with the time of Solomon. It is also probable that some at least of the square pillars, ranged in fifteen rows, and measuring five feet each side, which form the foundations of the Mosque <span class="accented">El Aksa</span>, and the supports of the area of the Haram, are of the same date and origin (cf. Ewald, Hist. Israel, 3:233). Porter holds that they are "coeval with the oldest part of the external walls." Many of them, the writer observed, were monoliths. The extensive vaults which they enclose are unquestionably "the subterranean vaults of the temple area" mentioned by Josephus (B.J. 5:3. 1), and the <span class="accented">"cavati sub terra montes"</span> of Tacitus. It may be added here that the recent explorations in Jerusalem have brought to light many evidences of Phoenician handiwork.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hiram then sent to Solomon, and promised in writing (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/2-10.htm">2 Chronicles 2:10</a>) to comply with his wishes. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;, "that which thou hast sent to me," i.e., hast asked of me by messenger. &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are not firs, but cypresses. "My servants shall bring down (the trees) from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts (i.e., bind them into rafts and have them floated) upon the sea to the place which thou shalt send (word) to me, and will take them (the rafts) to pieces there, and thou wilt take (i.e., fetch them thence)." The Chronicles give Yafo, i.e., Joppa, Jaffa, the nearest harbour to Jerusalem on the Mediterranean Sea, as the landing-place (see at <a href="/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>). "And thou wilt do all my desire to give bread for my house," i.e., provisions to supply the wants of the king's court. "The &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a> was also to be paid" (Thenius). This is quite correct; but Thenius is wrong when he proceeds still further to assert, that the chronicler erroneously supposed this to refer to the servants of Hiram who were employed in working the wood. There is not a word of this kind in the Chronicles; but simply Solomon's promise to Hiram (<a href="/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>): "with regard to the hewers (the fellers of the trees), I give thy servants wheat 20,000 cors, and barley 20,000 cors, and wine 20,000 baths, and oil 20,000 baths." This is omitted in our account, in which the wages promised in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a> to the Sidonian fellers of wood are not more minutely defined. On the other hand, the payment for the wood delivered by Solomon to Hiram, which is not mentioned in the Chronicles, is stated here in <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. "Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food (&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, a contraction of &#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;; cf. Ewald, 79, b.) for his house (the maintenance of his royal court), and 20 cors of beaten oil; this gave Solomon to Hiram year by year," probably as long as the delivery of the wood or the erection of Solomon's buildings lasted. These two accounts are so clear, that Jac. Capp., Gramt., Mov., Thenius, and Bertheau, who have been led by critical prejudices to confound them with one another, and therefore to attempt to emend the one from the other, are left quite alone. For the circumstance that the quantity of wheat, which Solomon supplied to Hiram for his court, was just the same as that which he gave to the Sidonian workmen, does not warrant our identifying the two accounts. The fellers of the trees also received barley, wine, and oil in considerable quantities; whereas the only other thing which Hiram received for his court was oil, and that not common oil, but the finest olive oil, namely 20 cors of &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503;, i.e., beaten oil, the finest kind of oil, which was obtained from the olives when not quite ripe by pounding them in mortars, and which had not only a whiter colour, but also a purer flavour than the common oil obtained by pressing from the ripe olives (cf. Celsii Hierobot. ii. pp. 349f., and Bhr, Symbolik, i. p. 419). Twenty cors were 200 baths, i.e., according to the calculations of Thenius, about ten casks (1 cask  equals  6 pails; 1 pail  equals  72 cans). If we bear in mind that this was the finest kind of oil, we cannot speak of disproportion to the quantity of wheat delivered. Thenius reckons that 20,000 cors of wheat were about 38,250 Dresden scheffeln (? sacks).</body></html>
