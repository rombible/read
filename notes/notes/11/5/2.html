There is no adversary, no Satan, so the word is; no instrument of Satan to oppose it, or to divert from it. Satan does all he can, to hinder temple work. When there is no evil abroad, then let us be ready and active in that which is good, and get forward. Let God's promises quicken our endeavours. And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17. Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and is benefitted by another, that there may be dependence on one another, to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hiram, king of Tyre - Menander of Ephesus, who wrote a history of Tyre in Greek, founded upon native Tyrian documents, about 300 B.C., mentioned this Hiram as the son of Abibaal king of Tyre, and said that he ascended the throne when he was nineteen; that he reigned thirty-four years, and, dying at the age of fifty-three, was succeeded by his son Baleazar.

Hiram Sends to Congratulate Solomon.<p>1. Hiram &#8230; sent his servants unto Solomon&#8212;the grandson of David's contemporary [Kitto]; or the same Hiram [Winer and others]. The friendly relations which the king of Tyre had cultivated with David are here seen renewed with his son and successor, by a message of condolence as well as of congratulation on his accession to the throne of Israel. The alliance between the two nations had been mutually beneficial by the encouragement of useful traffic. Israel, being agricultural, furnished corn and oil, while the Tyrians, who were a commercial people, gave in exchange their Phœnician manufactures, as well as the produce of foreign lands. A special treaty was now entered into in furtherance of that undertaking which was the great work of Solomon's splendid and peaceful reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Solomon sent to Hiram,.... A letter, either by the hand of his ambassadors when they returned, as Kimchi thinks, or by ambassadors Solomon sent on purpose. Josephus (w) appeals to the Tyrian archives for the genuineness of these letters that passed between Hiram and Solomon; and Eupolemus, an Heathen writer (x) has both this which Solomon sent to Hiram, and that which Hiram sent in answer to it, which agree with those in the sacred records: <p>saying: as follows. <p>(w) Antiqu. l. 8. c. 2. sect. 8.

Hence we find &#1511;&#1512;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; used in <a href="/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a> to denote Arabia in the widest sense, on the east and south-east of Palestine; whereas in <a href="/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a> &#1511;&#1512;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; signifies the land beyond the Euphrates, viz., Mesopotamia, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, &#1511;&#1512;&#1501; &#1492;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;, the mountains of Mesopotamia. Consequently by "the sons of the East" we are to understand here primarily the Arabians, who were celebrated for their gnomic wisdom, more especially the Sabaeans (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10</a>), including the Idumaeans, particularly the Temanites (<a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>); but also, as &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; requires, the Chaldaeans, who were celebrated both for their astronomy and astrology. "All the wisdom of the Egyptians," because the wisdom of the Egyptians, which was so greatly renowned as almost to have become proverbial (cf. <a href="/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/31-2.htm">Isaiah 31:2</a>, and <a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a>; Joseph. Ant. viii. 2, 5; Herod. ii. 160), extended over the most diverse branches of knowledge, such as geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and astrology (Diod. Sic. i. 73 and 81), and as their skill in the preparation of ointments from vegetable and animal sources, and their extensive acquaintance with medicine, clearly prove, embraced natural science as well, in which Solomon, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>, was very learned.</body></html>
