but the trees were not yet cut down and prepared. <span class="ital">Twenty thousand measures of wheat — </span>Each measure spoken of here is supposed to contain six hundred and forty-eight pounds weight, so that the weight of the wheat yearly given to Hiram was two millions one hundred and sixty thousand pounds. <span class="ital">Twenty measures of pure oil — </span>In the parallel place, <a href="/2_chronicles/2-10.htm" title="And, behold, I will give to your servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.">2 Chronicles 2:10</a>. it is twenty thousand baths of oil, which has the sanction of many of the versions, and seems the most probable reading in this place; and so in <a href="/1_kings/5-16.htm" title="Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that worked in the work.">1 Kings 5:16</a>, instead of <span class="ital">three hundred, </span>it is <span class="ital">six hundred </span>in the Chronicles; a variation which it is not easy to reconcile without supposing an error, most probably in this place, as the Seventy give their authority to the reading in the Chronicles. But it is thought by some that the place in Chronicles speaks of what was given to the workmen, who had other things, there mentioned, besides, to support them in their labour; but that this place speaks of what was given for the use of Hiram’s family. <span class="ital">Thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year — </span>Either for sustenance to the workmen during the years wherein they were employed in cutting down or hewing of timber, or for the yearly support of the king’s house during the said time. Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of another, and is benefited by an other, that there may be a mutual correspondence and dependence, to the glory of God our common parent.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:10-18 The temple was chiefly built by the riches and labour of Gentiles, which typified their being called into the church. Solomon commanded, and they brought costly stones for the foundation. Christ, who is laid for a Foundation, is a chosen and precious Stone. We should lay our foundation firm, and bestow most pains on that part of our religion which lies out of the sight of men. And happy those who, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.

The timber was first carried westward from the flanks of Lebanon to the nearest part of the coast, where it was collected into floats, or rafts, which were then conveyed southward along the coast to Joppa, now Jaffa, from where the land journey to Jerusalem was not more than about forty miles. A similar course was taken on the building of the second temple <a href="/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>.<p>Food for my household - The Phoenician cities had very little arable territory of their own, the mountain range of Lebanon rising rapidly behind them; and they must always have imported the chief part of their sustenance from abroad. They seem commonly to have derived it from Judaea (marginal references). Hiram agreed now to accept for his timber and for the services of his workmen <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a> a certain annual payment of grain and oil, both of them the best of their kind, for the sustentation of his court.
