So great a stretch of arbitrary power as is implied in this compulsory levy would have raised great discontent, if not opposition, had not his wise arrangement of letting the laborers remain at home two months out of three, added to the sacredness of the work, reconciled the people to this forced labor. The carrying of burdens and the irksome work of excavating the quarries was assigned to the remnant of the Canaanites (1Ki 9:20; 2Ch 8:7-9) and war prisoners made by David&#8212;amounting to 153,600.

These the king compelled to do the harder and more menial work, and the whole number of these non-Israelites was called out for work. Their number is stated in Chronicles to have been 153,600; of these 70,000 were bearers of burdens, 80,000 hewers in the mountains and the other 3600 (see Chronicles <span class="ital">l. c.</span>) were overseers to set the people a-work.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains.</span> [These 150,000, destined for the more laborious and menial works, were not Israelites, but Canaanites. We learn from <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</a> that "all the strangers that were in the land of Israel" were subjected to forced labour by Solomon - there were, that is to say, but 150,000 of them remaining. They occupied a very different position from that of the 30,000 Hebrews. None of the latter were reduced to bondage (<a href="/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>), while the former had long been employed in servile work. The Gibeonites were reduced to serfdom by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), and the rest of the Canaanites as they were conquered  (<a href="/joshua/6-10.htm">Joshua 6:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29, 30</a>). In <a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>, we find some of them employed on public works by David. By the "hewers" many commentators have supposed that stonecutters alone are intended (so Jos., Ant., 8:02.9) partly because stone is mentioned presently, and partly because <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> is mostly used of the quarrying or cutting of stone, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-12.htm">2 Kings 12:12</a>, etc. Gesenius understands the word both of stone and wood cutters. But is it not probable that the latter alone are indicated? That the word is sometimes used of woodcutting <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a> shows. And the words, "<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">the mountain"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) almost compel us so to understand it here. "The mountain" must be Lebanon. But surely the <span class="accented">stone</span> was not transported, to any great extent, like the wood, so great a distance over land and sea, especially when it abounded on the spot. (The tradition that the stone was quarried at Baalbek is quite unworthy of credence. It has no doubt sprung from the huge stones found there. "The temple was built of the beautiful white stone of the country, the hard <span class="accented">missal"</span> (Warren, p. 60.) It is true the number of wood cutters would thus appear to be very great, but it is to be remembered how few comparatively were the appliances or machines of those days: almost everything must be done by manual labour. And Pliny tells us that no less than 360,000 men were employed for twenty years on one of the pyramids. It is possible, however, that the huge foundations mentioned below (ver. 17) were brought from Lebanon.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hiram then sent to Solomon, and promised in writing (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1489;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/2-10.htm">2 Chronicles 2:10</a>) to comply with his wishes. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514;, "that which thou hast sent to me," i.e., hast asked of me by messenger. &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; are not firs, but cypresses. "My servants shall bring down (the trees) from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts (i.e., bind them into rafts and have them floated) upon the sea to the place which thou shalt send (word) to me, and will take them (the rafts) to pieces there, and thou wilt take (i.e., fetch them thence)." The Chronicles give Yafo, i.e., Joppa, Jaffa, the nearest harbour to Jerusalem on the Mediterranean Sea, as the landing-place (see at <a href="/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>). "And thou wilt do all my desire to give bread for my house," i.e., provisions to supply the wants of the king's court. "The &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a> was also to be paid" (Thenius). This is quite correct; but Thenius is wrong when he proceeds still further to assert, that the chronicler erroneously supposed this to refer to the servants of Hiram who were employed in working the wood. There is not a word of this kind in the Chronicles; but simply Solomon's promise to Hiram (<a href="/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>): "with regard to the hewers (the fellers of the trees), I give thy servants wheat 20,000 cors, and barley 20,000 cors, and wine 20,000 baths, and oil 20,000 baths." This is omitted in our account, in which the wages promised in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a> to the Sidonian fellers of wood are not more minutely defined. On the other hand, the payment for the wood delivered by Solomon to Hiram, which is not mentioned in the Chronicles, is stated here in <a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. "Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food (&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, a contraction of &#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, from &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;; cf. Ewald, 79, b.) for his house (the maintenance of his royal court), and 20 cors of beaten oil; this gave Solomon to Hiram year by year," probably as long as the delivery of the wood or the erection of Solomon's buildings lasted. These two accounts are so clear, that Jac. Capp., Gramt., Mov., Thenius, and Bertheau, who have been led by critical prejudices to confound them with one another, and therefore to attempt to emend the one from the other, are left quite alone. For the circumstance that the quantity of wheat, which Solomon supplied to Hiram for his court, was just the same as that which he gave to the Sidonian workmen, does not warrant our identifying the two accounts. The fellers of the trees also received barley, wine, and oil in considerable quantities; whereas the only other thing which Hiram received for his court was oil, and that not common oil, but the finest olive oil, namely 20 cors of &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503;, i.e., beaten oil, the finest kind of oil, which was obtained from the olives when not quite ripe by pounding them in mortars, and which had not only a whiter colour, but also a purer flavour than the common oil obtained by pressing from the ripe olives (cf. Celsii Hierobot. ii. pp. 349f., and Bhr, Symbolik, i. p. 419). Twenty cors were 200 baths, i.e., according to the calculations of Thenius, about ten casks (1 cask  equals  6 pails; 1 pail  equals  72 cans). If we bear in mind that this was the finest kind of oil, we cannot speak of disproportion to the quantity of wheat delivered. Thenius reckons that 20,000 cors of wheat were about 38,250 Dresden scheffeln (? sacks).</body></html>
