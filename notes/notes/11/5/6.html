The forest of Lebanon was proverbial for its beauty and fragrance (<a href="/songs/4-11.htm" title="Your lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>; <a href="/context/hosea/14-6.htm" title="His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.">Hosea 14:6-7</a>), watered by the streams from the snowy heights (<a href="/jeremiah/18-14.htm" title="Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which comes from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?">Jeremiah 18:14</a>), when all Palestine was parched up. The cedars which now remain—a mere group, at a height of about six thousand feet—are but a remnant of the once magnificent forest which “the Lord had planted” (<a href="/psalms/104-16.htm" title="The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;">Psalm 104:16</a>). Solomon’s request—couched almost in the language of command—is simply for cedar wood, or rather, for skilled labour in felling and working it, for which the Tyrians were proverbially famed in all ancient records. For this labour he offers to pay; while he seems to take for granted a right for his own servants to come and bring away the timber itself. Hiram’s answer (<a href="/1_kings/5-8.htm" title="And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me for: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.">1Kings 5:8</a>) mentions “timber of fir” also, which agrees exactly with the fuller account of Solomon’s request given in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-8.htm" title="Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,">2Chronicles 2:8</a>. The pine still grows abundantly in the sandstone regions of Lebanon; but it is almost certain that “the fir” here named is the cypress.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm" title="Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.">1 Kings 5:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now therefore command thou, that they — </span>That is, thy servants, who are skilful in such work; <span class="ital">hew me cedar-trees — </span>Which, for their soundness, and strength, and fragrancy, and durable-ness, were most proper for his design.

And all outward skill and advantages should be made serviceable to the interests of Christ's kingdom. It Tyre supplies Israel with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn, Eze 27:17.

Still there is no doubt that the real Lebanon cedar is most commonly intended by it. This tree, which still grows on parts of the mountain, but which threatens to die out, was probably much more widely spread anciently. The Tyrians made the masts of their ships from the wood <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>, and would naturally be as careful to cultivate it as we have ourselves been to grow oak. The Assyrian kings, when they made their expeditions into Palestine, appear frequently to have cut it in Lebanon and Hermon, and to have transported it to their own capitals.<p>Skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians - The mechanical genius and nautical skill of the Phoenicians generally, and of the Sidonians in particular, is noticed by Homer and Herodotus. In the reign of Hiram, Sidon, though perhaps she might have a king of her own, acknowledged the supremacy of Tyre. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon&#8212;Nowhere else could Solomon have procured materials for the woodwork of his contemplated building. The forests of Lebanon, adjoining the seas in Solomon's time, belonged to the Phœnicians, and the timber being a lucrative branch of their exports, immense numbers of workmen were constantly employed in the felling of trees as well as the transportation and preparation of the wood. Hiram stipulated to furnish Solomon with as large a quantity of cedars and cypresses as he might require and it was a great additional obligation that he engaged to render the important service of having it brought down, probably by the Dog river, to the seaside, and conveyed along the coast in floats; that is, the logs being bound together, to the harbor of Joppa (2Ch 2:16), whence they could easily find the means of transport to Jerusalem.<p>my servants shall be with thy servants&#8212;The operations were to be on so extensive a scale that the Tyrians alone would be insufficient.

That is, order his servants to cut them down there for him. Some think that Lebanon belonged to the land of Israel, and therefore Solomon did not ask for the cedars upon it, but for his servants to hew them for him; but as it lay upon the borders of Israel, part of it might belong to them, and another part to Hiram, and on which the best cedars might grow, and so he furnished Solomon both with trees, and men to cut them, as it seems from <a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; see also <a href="/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3</a>; <p>and my servants shall be with thy servants: to assist them, and to carry the timber from place to place, and to learn how to hew timber: <p>and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants, according to all that thou shalt appoint; pay them for their work and service, as Hiram himself should judge fit and reasonable for them; no mention being made of paying for the timber, seems to countenance the notion that the trees were Solomon's; but when the quantity of provisions sent yearly to Hiram for his household, besides what the servants had, is observed, it seems to have been sent as an equivalent to the timber received by Solomon, see <a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <p>for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians; it is not said Tyrians, the Sidonians, perhaps, being more skilful in this than they were; and the Sidonians are said by Homer (y) to be  very ingenious: and they were both under the jurisdiction and at the command of Hiram; so Eupolemus (z) makes the inscription of Solomon's letter to him to run thus, to Suron (that is, Hiram) king of Tyre, Sidon, and Phoenicia. The Jews being chiefly employed in husbandry, and in feeding cattle, were very unskilful in mechanic arts, and in this of cutting down trees, and hewing timber; for there is skill to be exercised therein; the proper time of cutting down trees should be observed, the part in which they are to be cut, and the position in which they are to be put when cut down, as Vitruvius (a) directs, with other things, and Pliny (b) observes the same. <p>(y) Iliad. 23. ver. 743.

He desires also much other wood beside cedar.

Verg. <span class="ital">Æn.</span> iv. 137 ‘Sidoniam picto chlamydem circumdata limbo.’ Homer tells us of the great skill of Sidonian workmen: the embroidered robes of Andromache and the bowl given by Achilles as a prize at the games in honour of Patroclus were of Sidonian workmanship.

"It is the <span class="accented">Merit Blanc</span> of Palestine" (Porter); but whether it is so called because of its summits of snow or because of the colour of its limestone is uncertain. Practically, the cedars are now found in one place only, though Ehrenberg is said to have found them in considerable numbers to the north of the road between Baalbek and Tripoli. "At the head of Wady Kadisha there is a vast recess in the central ridge of Lebanon, some eight miles in diameter. Above it rise the loftiest summits in Syria, streaked with perpetual snow...  In the very centre of this recess, on a little irregular knoll, stands the clump of cedars" (<span class="accented">Ibid.</span>, Handbook, 2 p. 584), over 6,000 feet above the level of the sea. It would seem as if that part of Lebanon where the cedars grew belonged to Hiram's dominion. "The northern frontier of Canaan did not reach as far as Bjerrsh" (Keil), where the cedar grove is now. The idea of some older writers that the cedars belonged to Solomon, and  that he only asked Hiram for artificers ("that they <span class="accented">hew</span> me cedar trees," etc.) is negatived by ver. 10. It is true that "all Lebanon" was given to Israel (<a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), but they did not take it. They did not drive out the Zidonians (ver. 6; <a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>) or possess" the land of the Giblites" (ver. 5; <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>). It should be stated here, however, that the cedar of Scripture probably included other varieties than that which now, alone bears the name (see on ver. 8)], <span class="cmt_word">and my servants shall be with Shy servants</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, sharing and lightening the work]: <span class="cmt_word">and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants</span> [Solomon engaged to pay and did pay both Hiram and his subjects for the services of the latter, and he paid both in kind.

See note on ver. 18. By profane, as well as sacred writers, the Phoenicians are often described by the name Zidonians, no doubt for the reason mentioned in the note on ver. 1. See Homer, Iliad 6:290; 23. 743; Odys. 4:84, 618; 17:4.24. Cf. Virg.

But what deserves especial notice here is the fact that the Zidonians constructed their houses of <span class="accented">wood</span>, and were celebrated from the earliest times as skilful builders. The fleets which the Phoenicians constructed for purposes of commerce would ensure them a supply of clever workmen. Wordsworth aptly remarks on the part the heathen thus took in rearing a temple for the God of Jacob.

According to the Koran (Sure xxvii. <a href="/1_kings/4-17.htm">1 Kings 4:17</a>.), Solomon understood the languages not only of men and demons, but also of birds and ants.
