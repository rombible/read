It would be quite in harmony with Jeroboam’s astuteness, if, after setting the revolution on foot, he himself stood aloof from leadership, and waited till “the congregation,” the duly summoned assembly, sent for him and offered him the crown. The title “king over all Israel” certainly indicates a claim on the part of the ten tribes to be the true Israel, relying perhaps on the prophetic choice and blessing of Jeroboam, and professing to have risen in the name of the Lord against the idolatry of Solomon and his house. Perhaps it also indicated a desire for the subjugation of Judah, which Jeroboam, with the aid of Shishak, certainly seems to have subsequently attempted.<p>(20, 21) In these two verses we have again the same curious juxtaposition of “the tribe of Judah only” and “the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin.” The army gathered would be, no doubt, drawn from Solomon’s established and disciplined forces, as well as from the levy of Judah and Benjamin generally—perhaps including (as in <a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,">2Samuel 17:27</a>) contingents from the tributary races—who would be attached with a strong personal allegiance to the house of Solomon, and prepared to stamp out the rebellion, before it could thoroughly organise itself for disciplined resistance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/12-20.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.">1 Kings 12:20</a>. </span><span class="ital">When all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come — </span>From Egypt; which was known to the great men, and to such as met at Shechem before, and was now spread over the country; <span class="ital">they sent </span>— To his tent, or habitation, to which he had retired from Shechem, as the others, who had met there had generally done. <span class="ital">And called him unto the congregation — </span>Which had been summoned by the elders of the several tribes, to consider how to settle their affairs, which they easily agreed to do, by conferring the crown on Jeroboam, according to God’s promise made to him. <span class="ital">None followed the house of David — </span>No entire tribe; <span class="ital">but the tribe of Judah — </span>Which comprehended Benjamin also, being one with it, as was observed before, <a href="/1_kings/11-32.htm" title="(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)">1 Kings 11:32</a>.

How soon are good men, and their good services to the public, forgotten ! These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people hearkened to the word of the Lord. When we know God's mind, we must submit, how much soever it crosses our own mind.

The congregation selected Jeroboam. The rank, the talent, and the known energy of the late exile, his natural hostility to the house of Solomon, his Ephraimitic descent, his acquaintance with the art of fortification, and the friendly relations subsisting between him and the great Egyptian king, pointed him out as the most suitable man for the vacant post. If, according to the Septuagint, Shishak had not only protected him against Solomon, but also given him an Egyptian princess, sister to his own queen, in marriage, his position must have been such that no other Israelite could have borne comparison with him. Again, the prophecy of Ahijah would have been remembered by the more religious part of the nation, and would have secured to Jeroboam their adhesion; so that every motive, whether of policy or of religion, would have united to recommend the son of Nebat to the suffrages of his countrymen. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 12:20-33.

Rehoboam determined to assert his authority by leading a large force into the disaffected provinces. But the revolt of the ten tribes was completed when the prophet Shemaiah ordered, in the Lord's name, an abandonment of any hostile measures against the revolutionists.

If, however, the received text of vers. 8, 12 is retained (see on ver. 3), then we must understand the "all Israel" in ver. 1 of the <span class="accented">representatives</span> of the different tribes, and here, of the entire nation who had heard from its representatives, on their return to their homes (ver. 16), of the presence of Jeroboam in the country], <span class="cmt_word">that they sent and called him unto the congregation</span> [Where and when this gathering was held we are not informed. Probably it was at Shechem, and soon after Rehoboam's flight. After the open and irreparable breach which they had made (ver. 18), the leaders of the tribes would naturally assemble at once to concert measures for their defence and future government], <span class="cmt_word">and made him king</span> [by anointing. Note on ver. 1] <span class="cmt_word">over all Israel</span> [This public and formal consecration of Jeroboam completed the secession of the northern tribes. Was this secession sinful? Bahr, Keil, and others, who start from the assumption that secession was determined upon even before Rehoboam came to Shechem, and that the complaints of the people respecting the grievous service to which they had been subjected by Solomon were groundless, naturally conclude that it was altogether treasonable and unjustifiable. But is this conclusion borne out by the facts? We may readily admit that the schism was not accomplished without sin: we cannot but allow that Israel acted with undue precipitation, and that Rehoboam, who was "young and tenderhearted," was entitled, for David's and Solomon's sake, as well as his own, to greater forbearance and consideration, and it is almost certain that both the "envy of Ephraim" and the ambition of Jeroboam largely influenced the result. At the same time, it is to be remembered that the division of the kingdom was ordained of God, and that the people had just cause of complaint, if not, indeed, sufficient warrant for resistance, in the arbitrary and insolent rejection of their petition by the young king. No law of God requires men to yield themselves up without a struggle to such cruel and abject slavery as Rehoboam threatened these men with. They judged - and who shall say unreasonably? - from his words that they had only tyranny and cruelty to expect at his hands, and what wonder if they stood on their defence? They are only to be blamed because they did more. But lawful resistance not uncommonly ripens into unlawful rebellion]: <span class="cmt_word">there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</span> [This general statement is qualified immediately afterwards (ver. 21). The tribe of Benjamin, "the smallest of the tribes of Israel" (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), "little  Benjamin" (<a href="/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>), is here omitted as of comparatively small account. Exact precision has never characterized Oriental writers. There is no suspicion of untruth: it is the genius of the people to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"disdain the lore,<br />Of nicely calculated less and more."</span> It may be added here that Edom remained under the sway of Judah until the reign of Jehoram (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>), just as Moab and other portions of Solomon's empire for a considerable period formed part of the new kingdom of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4, 5</a>).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Rehoboam forsook this advice, and asked the younger ministers who had grown up with him. They advised him to overawe the people by harsh threats. "My little finger is stronger than my father's loins." &#1511;&#1496;&#1497;, from &#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, littleness, i.e., the little finger (for the form, see Ewald, 255, b.), - a figurative expression in the sense of, I possess much greater might than my father. "And now, my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, and I will still further add to your yoke (lay still more upon you): my father chastised you with whips, I will chastise you with scorpions." &#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, scorpiones, are whips with barbed points like the point of a scorpion's sting.<p>(Note: The Rabbins give this explanation: virgae spinis instructae. Isidor. HisPal. Origg. v. c. 27, explains it in a similar manner: virga si est nodosa vel aculeata, scorpio vocatur. The Targ. and Syr., on the other hand, &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1490;&#1497;&#1503;, Syr. ma&#772;rgana&#772;', i.e., the Greek &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, a whip. See the various explanations in Bochart, Hieroz. iii. p. 554f. ed. Ros.)<p>This advice was not only imprudent, "considering all the circumstances" (Seb. Schmidt), but it was unwise in itself, and could only accelerate the secession of the discontented. It was the language of a tyrant, and not of a ruler whom God had placed over His people. This is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/12-14.htm">1 Kings 12:14</a> : "The king answered the people harshly, and forsook the counsel of the old men," i.e., the counsellors who were rich in experience, and spoke according to the counsels of the young men, who flattered his ambition. It is very doubtful, indeed, whether the advice of the old men would have been followed by so favourable a result; it might probably have been so for the moment, but not for a permanency. For the king could not become the &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; of the people, serve the people, without prejudicing the authority entrusted to him by God; though there is no doubt that if he had consented to such condescension, he would have deprived the discontented tribes of all pretext for rebellion, and not have shared in the sin of their secession.</body></html>
