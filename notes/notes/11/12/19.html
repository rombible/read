These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge.

Rehoboam's weakness (Ec 2:18, 19) and inexperience in public affairs has given rise to the probable conjecture, that, like many other princes in the East, he had been kept secluded in the harem till the period of his accession (Ec 4:14), his father being either afraid of his aspiring to the sovereignty, like the two sons of David, or, which is more probable, afraid of prematurely exposing his imbecility. The king's haughty and violent answer to a people already filled with a spirit of discontent and exasperation, indicated so great an incapacity to appreciate the gravity of the crisis, so utter a want of common sense, as to create a belief that he was struck with judicial blindness. It was received with mingled scorn and derision. The revolt was accomplished, and yet so quietly, that Rehoboam remained in Shechem, fancying himself the sovereign of a united kingdom, until his chief tax gatherer, who had been most imprudently sent to treat with the people, had been stoned to death. This opened his eyes, and he fled for security to Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Their revolt is called <span class="ital">rebellion</span>, and therefore was sinful, because it was contrary to God’s authority, and command of subjection to David, and his seed for ever; from which the people were not freed by God’s promise and grant made to Jeroboam, which was but a secret transaction, not yet sufficiently revealed to them, and was not a grant of present and actual possession; but only a promise that God would give it to him in his own time and way, which might have been done, though neither Jeroboam nor the people had used these indirect and evil courses to bring it about, as it befell David upon the same occasion. Besides, the people did not this in compliance with God’s counsel, but to gratify their own passions, and get themselves a little ease. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

They advised him to overawe the people by harsh threats. "My little finger is stronger than my father's loins." &#1511;&#1496;&#1497;, from &#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, littleness, i.e., the little finger (for the form, see Ewald, 255, b.), - a figurative expression in the sense of, I possess much greater might than my father. "And now, my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, and I will still further add to your yoke (lay still more upon you): my father chastised you with whips, I will chastise you with scorpions." &#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, scorpiones, are whips with barbed points like the point of a scorpion's sting.<p>(Note: The Rabbins give this explanation: virgae spinis instructae. Isidor. HisPal. Origg. v. c. 27, explains it in a similar manner: virga si est nodosa vel aculeata, scorpio vocatur. The Targ. and Syr., on the other hand, &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1490;&#1497;&#1503;, Syr. ma&#772;rgana&#772;', i.e., the Greek &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, a whip. See the various explanations in Bochart, Hieroz. iii. p. 554f. ed. Ros.)<p>This advice was not only imprudent, "considering all the circumstances" (Seb. Schmidt), but it was unwise in itself, and could only accelerate the secession of the discontented. It was the language of a tyrant, and not of a ruler whom God had placed over His people. This is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/12-14.htm">1 Kings 12:14</a> : "The king answered the people harshly, and forsook the counsel of the old men," i.e., the counsellors who were rich in experience, and spoke according to the counsels of the young men, who flattered his ambition. It is very doubtful, indeed, whether the advice of the old men would have been followed by so favourable a result; it might probably have been so for the moment, but not for a permanency. For the king could not become the &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; of the people, serve the people, without prejudicing the authority entrusted to him by God; though there is no doubt that if he had consented to such condescension, he would have deprived the discontented tribes of all pretext for rebellion, and not have shared in the sin of their secession.</body></html>
