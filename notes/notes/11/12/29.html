A practical disbelief of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom of all our departures from him. Though it is probable he meant his worship for Jehovah the God of Israel, it was contrary to the Divine law, and dishonourable to the Divine majesty to be thus represented. The people might be less shocked at worshipping the God of Israel under an image, than if they had at once been asked to worship Baal; but it made way for that idolatry. Blessed Lord, give us grace to reverence thy temple, thine ordinances, thine house of prayer, thy sabbaths, and never more, like Jeroboam, to set up in our hearts any idol of abomination. Be thou to us every thing precious; do thou reign and rule in our hearts, the hope of glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the first place, Jeroboam consulted the convenience of his subjects, who would thus in no case have very far to go in order to reach one or the other sanctuary. Further, he avoided the danger of reminding them continually that they had no ark - a danger which would have been imminent, had the two cherubs been placed together in one shrine.<p>He selected Bethel (in the south) for one of his seats of worship, on account of its pre-eminent sanctity.

Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David&#8212;Having received the kingdom from God, he should have relied on the divine protection. But he did not. With a view to withdraw the people from the temple and destroy the sacred associations connected with Jerusalem, he made serious and unwarranted innovations on the religious observances of the country, on pretext of saving the people the trouble and expense of a distant journey. First, he erected two golden calves&#8212;the young bulls, Apis and Mnevis, as symbols (in the Egyptian fashion) of the true God, and the nearest, according to his fancy, to the figures of the cherubim. The one was placed at Dan, in the northern part of his kingdom; the other at Beth-el, the southern extremity, in sight of Jerusalem, and in which place he probably thought God was as likely to manifest Himself as at Jerusalem (Ge 32:1-32; 2Ki 2:2). The latter place was the most frequented&#8212;for the words (1Ki 12:30) should be rendered, "the people even to Dan went to worship before the one" (Jer 48:13; Am 4:4, 5; 5:5; Ho 5:8; 10:8). The innovation was a sin because it was setting up the worship of God by symbols and images and departing from the place where He had chosen to put His name. Secondly, he changed the feast of tabernacles from the fifteenth of the seventh to the fifteenth of the eighth month. The ostensible reason might be, that the ingathering or harvest was later in the northern parts of the kingdom; but the real reason was to eradicate the old association with this, the most welcome and joyous festival of the year.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which two places he chose for his people’s conveniency; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beth-el</span> being in the southern, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dan</span> in the northern parts of his kingdom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he set the one in Bethel,....

The places chosen by Jeroboam were at either limit of his kingdom, and had been associated with religious worship in ancient times.

First, both these places were in some sort sanctuaries already. Bethel was already a <span class="accented">makom</span>, or holy place, in the days of Abraham; was consecrated by the visions and altar of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11-19</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1, 7, 15</a>), and by the ark having been there (<a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26-28</a>, Hebrews; cf. Jos., Ant., 5:02.10). And though Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>; <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>) can hardly have had as sacred a character as the "house of God and the gate of heaven" (<a href="/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>) had, still it had its shrine and its schismatic priesthood. A grandson of Moses (<a href="/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13</a>, true reading) had ministered there, and his sons were the priests of Dan still. Secondly, these localities would suit the convenience of his subjects, being respectively at the southern and northern extremities of the kingdom. And this, no doubt, was one reason why Dan was chosen in preference to other places, such as Shiloh, which, though more sacred,  were less conveniently situated. A sanctuary at Dan would save the northern tribes many tedious journeys. It should be remarked that Bethel properly belonged to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13, 22</a>), though it was also on the border of Ephraim; and it has been suggested that it was Jeroboam's selection of this place as a seat of the calf worship decided the tribe of Benjamin to follow the lead of Judah. But the narrative seems to imply that their choice had been made at an earlier period (ver. 21), and the city would seem to have been long in the possession of the house of Joseph (<a href="/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22</a>). It is now known as <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, and is one of the most naked and dreary spots in Palestine. "The place seems, as it were, turned to stone; and we can well imagine that the patriarch found nothing softer than a stone for his pillow." Conder, p. 252, who suggests that from the time of Abraham Bethel was a <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, a sacred place merely (<a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>), and distinct from the adjoining <span class="accented">city</span> of Luz (ver. 19).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But after the return of Rehoboam to Jerusalem he was still desirous of bringing back the seceders by force of arms, and raised for that purpose an army of 180,000 men out of all Judah, the tribe of Benjamin, and the rest of the people, i.e., the Israelites dwelling in the cities of Judah, - a number which does not appear too large according to <a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>. But the prophet Shemaiah, a prophet who is not mentioned again, received instructions from God to forbid the king to go to war with their brethren the Israelites, "for this thing was from the Lord." &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, "this thing, i.e., his being deprived of the sovereignty over ten tribes, but not their rebellion" (Seb.
