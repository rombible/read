The Adoram here mentioned must be identical with the officer of Solomon; but, though it is possible, it is not likely that he could have held office in David’s time. Probably the name and office were hereditary<span class= "greekheb">׳</span>. The mission of Adoram shows that, too late, Renoboam desired to deal through him with the grievance of forced labour. But the sight of the man, who had been the taskmaster of their oppression, naturally stirred the multitude to a fresh burst of fury, venting itself in his murder, and perhaps threatening his master also, had he not fled hastily at once to Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/12-18.htm" title="Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.

For, it seems, he had continued there in the midst of his kingdom, and among the seditious tribes, that he might overawe them by his presence, and repress any tumults in their first rise: but from thence, as soon as he saw himself in danger, he fled away in his chariot, with all speed, in the most cowardly manner, notwithstanding the haughtiness he had lately manifested, and the big words he had spoken. This seems to have been a still further degree of imprudence; for he should, if possible, have maintained his ground, and kept footing, as we speak, in the country of Israel, from whence it might not have been easy for them to expel him: but <span class="ital">fear is a bad adviser. </span>This is the first time that we find a king riding in a chariot; for we never read of Saul, or David, or Solomon riding in one.

These considerations should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the Author of them, and our brethren the instruments: let us not meditate revenge.

But it is highly improbable that the same person was chief superintendent of the forced labors during the whole of Solomon's long reign, and also during a part of David's and Rehoboam's. We may therefore conclude that the three names mark three distinct persons, perhaps of the same family, who were respectively contemporary with the three kings. Adoram was chosen, as best acquainted with the hardships whereof the rebels complained, to arrange some alleviation of their burthens. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-18. the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause was from the Lord&#8212;That was the overruling cause. Rehoboam's weakness (Ec 2:18, 19) and inexperience in public affairs has given rise to the probable conjecture, that, like many other princes in the East, he had been kept secluded in the harem till the period of his accession (Ec 4:14), his father being either afraid of his aspiring to the sovereignty, like the two sons of David, or, which is more probable, afraid of prematurely exposing his imbecility. The king's haughty and violent answer to a people already filled with a spirit of discontent and exasperation, indicated so great an incapacity to appreciate the gravity of the crisis, so utter a want of common sense, as to create a belief that he was struck with judicial blindness. It was received with mingled scorn and derision. The revolt was accomplished, and yet so quietly, that Rehoboam remained in Shechem, fancying himself the sovereign of a united kingdom, until his chief tax gatherer, who had been most imprudently sent to treat with the people, had been stoned to death. This opened his eyes, and he fled for security to Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He sent Adoram, </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

There was one of this name in this office in the time of David, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>, this is the same with Adoniram, as Jarchi thinks, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>, him he sent either to collect the tribute of the Ephraimites, to show his authority; or rather to call the people back to have some further discourse with them, and endeavour to soften things, and bring them to a compliance, so Josephus (l); but it was too late, and he employed a very improper person; the heavy taxes were their complaint, and a tax gatherer, and especially one that was at the head of the tribute, must be of all men the most disagreeable to them; this is another instance of the folly and false steps of Rehoboam: <p>and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died; the populace fell upon him at once, and stoned him to death; and which, though contrary to law and justice, was approved of and applauded by their principal men and all the people; so irritated and provoked were they by Rehoboam's answer to them. Hottinger (m) says, this man was buried in Shechem, which is very probable; but it is not expressed here, as he suggests it is; however, a grave stone, found A.

He presided over the forced-labour service, and it was an additional sign of the infatuation of Rehoboam, that a person so likely to be obnoxious to the people should be sent as the king’s representative. Josephus tells us that Rehoboam’s design was to appease and mollify the irritation caused by his answer. He could hardly have found worse means for his end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who was over the tribute</span>] Read, with R.V. ‘over the <span class="bld">levy</span>.’ See above on <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm" title="And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.">1 Kings 4:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and all Israel stoned him</span>] The LXX. omits ‘all Israel.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Therefore king Rehoboam made speed</span>] The marginal rendering of A.V. points out the literal meaning of the verb in this clause ‘he strengthened himself.’ The idea is ‘he made use of every effort,’ ‘exerted himself much,’ seeing that there was danger threatening him as well as his messenger. It appears from this verse, that little time had elapsed between the answer of Rehoboam and the sending of Adoram to appease the irritated leaders. All this was done and Adoram killed before Rehoboam left Shechem. The haughty stern answer and the sudden change to a policy of a more lenient nature are alike marks of the weak character of the new king.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute</span> [Probably the same officer as the Adoniram of ch. <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>. For "Adoram," the LXX. and other versions read "Adoniram" here. It is curious that a person of the same name, Adoram (LXX. Adoniram), was over David's levy (<a href="/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>). That there was a relationship, and that the office had descended from father to son, can hardly be doubted, but whether two persons or three are indicated it is impossible to say. It is of course just possible, though hardly likely that one and the same person (Ewald) can  have been superintendent of servile work under David, Solomon, and Rehoboam. It is generally assumed that the young king sent this officer "to treat with the rebels and to appease them, as Josephus expressly says" (Bahr). It seems quite as likely that he was sent to coerce them, or to collect the taxes, as a summary way of showing that the king meant to enforce his rights and was not moved by their words. For it is hardly probable that such a proud and headstrong prince as Rehoboam would stoop, especially after the confident threats which he had just uttered, to parley with rebels. Such a man, guided by such counsellors, and inflated with a sense of his own power and importance, would naturally think of force rather than of conciliation or concessions. He would be for trying his whips of scorpions. And if conciliation had been his object, it is hardly likely that he would have employed Adoram, the superintendent of the levy, a man who would naturally be obnoxious to the people, to effect it. Moreover the sequel - Adoram's tragical end - also favours the supposition that he was sent, not "to arrange some alleviation of their burdens" (Rawlinson), but to carry out the high-handed policy Of the king]; <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel stoned him with stones</span> ["With one exception, this was a bloodless revolution" (Stanley). It has been remarked that the practice of stoning is first heard of in the stony desert (Arabia <span class="accented">Petraea</span>). But in reality it is older than the date of the Exodus, as <a href="/exodus/8-26.htm">Exodus 8:26</a> shows. And it is an obvious and ready and summary way of despatching obnoxious persons (cf. <a href="/exodus/17-4.htm">Exodus 17:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>).

Therefore king Rehoboam made speed</span> [So the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The Hebrew literally means, as margin, "<span class="accented">strengthened himeself</span>." But the A.V. gives the practical force of the word. He bestirred himself; he lost no time; the death of Adoram showed him the danger of a moment's delay. "He saw those stones were thrown at him in his Adoram" (Hall).] <span class="cmt_word">to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Rehoboam forsook this advice, and asked the younger ministers who had grown up with him. They advised him to overawe the people by harsh threats. "My little finger is stronger than my father's loins." &#1511;&#1496;&#1497;, from &#1511;&#1496;&#1503;, littleness, i.e., the little finger (for the form, see Ewald, 255, b.), - a figurative expression in the sense of, I possess much greater might than my father. "And now, my father laid a heavy yoke upon you, and I will still further add to your yoke (lay still more upon you): my father chastised you with whips, I will chastise you with scorpions." &#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, scorpiones, are whips with barbed points like the point of a scorpion's sting.<p>(Note: The Rabbins give this explanation: virgae spinis instructae. Isidor. HisPal. Origg. v. c. 27, explains it in a similar manner: virga si est nodosa vel aculeata, scorpio vocatur.

See the various explanations in Bochart, Hieroz. iii. p. 554f. ed. Ros.)<p>This advice was not only imprudent, "considering all the circumstances" (Seb. Schmidt), but it was unwise in itself, and could only accelerate the secession of the discontented. It was the language of a tyrant, and not of a ruler whom God had placed over His people. This is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/12-14.htm">1 Kings 12:14</a> : "The king answered the people harshly, and forsook the counsel of the old men," i.e., the counsellors who were rich in experience, and spoke according to the counsels of the young men, who flattered his ambition. It is very doubtful, indeed, whether the advice of the old men would have been followed by so favourable a result; it might probably have been so for the moment, but not for a permanency. For the king could not become the &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; of the people, serve the people, without prejudicing the authority entrusted to him by God; though there is no doubt that if he had consented to such condescension, he would have deprived the discontented tribes of all pretext for rebellion, and not have shared in the sin of their secession.</body></html>
