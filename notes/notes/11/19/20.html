Idleness is no man's honour, nor is husbandry any man's disgrace. An honest calling in the world, does not put us out of the way of our heavenly calling, any more than it did Elisha. His heart was touched by the Holy Spirit, and he was ready to leave all to attend Elijah. It is in a day of power that Christ's subjects are made willing; nor would any come to Christ unless they were thus drawn. It was a discouraging time for prophets to set out in. A man that had consulted with flesh and blood, would not be fond of Elijah's mantle; yet Elisha cheerfully leaves all to accompany him. When the Saviour said to one and to another, Follow me, the dearest friends and most profitable occupations were cheerfully left, and the most arduous duties done from love to his name. May we, in like manner, feel the energy of his grace working in us mightily, and by unreserved submission at once, may we make our calling and election sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father ... - Not an unnatural request before following his new spiritual father.

Have I not chosen thee to be my companion and helper? Is not God’s voice calling thee, through me, to do Him service?’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he left the oxen</span> [As, being the last in the line, he could do, without stopping the others.

No doubt he too had long sighed and prayed over the demoralization of his country and the dishonour done to his God.

The latter soon showed his choice by <span class="accented">running</span> after him], <span class="cmt_word">and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.

Indeed, it would have been strange if there had been. A greater readiness to obey the prophetic summons, Elisha could not well have showed. Forthwith, as soon as he realized his call, "he left the oxen and ran after" his newmaster. True, he asks permission - and why should he not? for "grace is no enemy to good nature" - to give a parting embrace to the father and mother to whom he owed his life, and whom he had been required by God to honour. But there is no proof of "a divided heart" here. If he had begged to be allowed to stay and <span class="accented">bury</span> his mother and father (St. <a href="/luke/9-59.htm">Luke 9:59-61</a>) it might have been otherwise. But he suggests nothing of the kind. He says: "One kiss, one farewell, and then I will follow thee." It is a complete mistake, consequently, to interpret Elijah's words to mean, "Go, return to thy ploughing, for why shouldst thou quit it?...  Thou canst remain as thou art" (Rawlinson). Their true meaning, as evidenced by the sequel (ver. 21), clearly was, "Go back and kiss them; why shouldst thou not? <span class="accented">For</span>  what have I done to thee? I have summoned thee to follow me. But I have not required thee to repudiate thine own flesh and blood."] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Elijah heard this, he covered up his face in his cloak (&#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;; see at <a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>) and went out to the entrance to the cave. And behold he heard the question a second time, "What doest thou here, Elijah?" and answered with a repetition of his complain (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>, <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>). - While the appearance of God, not in the tempest, the earthquake, and the fire, but in a gentle rustling, revealed the Lord to him as a merciful and gracious God, long-suffering, and of great goodness and truth (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>), the answer to his complaint showed him that He did not leave guilt unpunished (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>), since the Lord gave him the following command, <a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15</a>.: "Go back in thy way to the desert of Damascus, and anoint Hazael king over Aram (see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-13</a>), and Jehu the son of Nimshi king over Israel (see <a href="/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2</a>), and Elisha the son of Shaphat prophet in thy stead" (see <a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>); and then added this promise, which must have quieted his zeal, that was praiseworthy in the feelings from which it sprang, although it had assumed too passionate a form, and have given him courage to continue his prophetic work: "And it will come to pass, that however escapeth the sword of Hazael, him will Jehu slay, and whoever escapeth the sword of Jehu, him will Elisha slay." </body></html>
