He declares that the wicked house of Ahab shall be rooted out, that the people of Israel shall be punished for their sins; and he shows that Elijah was not left alone as he had supposed, and also that a helper should at once be raised up for him. Thus all his complaints are answered and provided for. God's faithful ones are often his hidden ones, Ps 83:3, and the visible church is scarcely to be seen: the wheat is lost in chaff, and the gold in dross, till the sifting, refining, separating day comes. The Lord knows them that are his, though we do not; he sees in secret.

For the present, he is simply directed back into the path of practical duty. His mission is not yet over, there is still work for him to do. He receives special injunctions with respect to Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha; and he is comforted with a revelation well adapted to rouse him from his despondency: there are seven thousand who will sympathize with him in his trials, and who need his care and attention.<p>The wilderness of Damascus - Probably the district north of the prophet's own country, between Bashan and Damascus itself, and which was known in later times as Iturea and Gaulanitis. Here the prophet might be secure from Jezebel, while he could readily communicate with both Israel and Damascus, and execute the commissions with which he was entrusted.<p>When thou comest, anoint - Rather, "and thou shalt go and anoint," Elijah performed one only of the three commissions given to him. He appears to have been left free to choose the time for executing his commissions, and it would seem that he thought the proper occasion had not arisen either for the first or the second before his own translation. But he took care to communicate the divine commands to his successor, who performed them at the fitting moment (marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 19:4-18. He Is Comforted by an Angel.<p>4-18. went a day's journey into the wilderness&#8212;on the way from Beer-sheba to Horeb&#8212;a wide expanse of sand hills, covered with the retem (not juniper, but broom shrubs), whose tall and spreading branches, with their white leaves, afford a very cheering and refreshing shade. His gracious God did not lose sight of His fugitive servant, but watched over him, and, miraculously ministering to his wants, enabled him, in a better but not wholly right frame of mind, by virtue of that supernatural supply, to complete his contemplated journey. In the solitude of Sinai, God appeared to instruct him. "What doest thou here, Elijah?" was a searching question addressed to one who had been called to so arduous and urgent a mission as his. By an awful exhibition of divine power, he was made aware of the divine speaker who addressed him; his attention was arrested, his petulance was silenced, his heart was touched, and he was bid without delay return to the land of Israel, and prosecute the Lord's work there. To convince him that an idolatrous nation will not be unpunished, He commissions him to anoint three persons who were destined in Providence to avenge God's controversy with the people of Israel. Anointing is used synonymously with appointment (Jud 9:8), and is applied to all named, although Jehu alone had the consecrated oil poured over his head. They were all three destined to be eminent instruments in achieving the destruction of idolaters, though in different ways. But of the three commissions, Elijah personally executed only one; namely, the call of Elisha to be his assistant and successor [1Ki 19:19], and by him the other two were accomplished (2Ki 8:7-13; 9:1-10). Having thus satisfied the fiery zeal of the erring but sincere and pious prophet, the Lord proceeded to correct the erroneous impression under which Elijah had been laboring, of his being the sole adherent of the true religion in the land; for God, who seeth in secret, and knew all that were His, knew that there were seven thousand persons who had not done homage (literally, "kissed the hand") to Baal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Return on thy way, </span> by which thou camest; for so in part lay the way from Horeb to Damascus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:</span> <span class="ital">anoint</span>; either, first, Figuratively, i.e. appoint or declare him king; which was done, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord?

Thus he was sent by God’s encouragement, and with His protection, through the land of Israel from which he had fled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">anoint Hazael to be king over Syria</span>] So far as the Scripture record goes we have no notice that Elijah performed this command in its literal sense, Hazael being subsequently informed by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm" title="And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.">2 Kings 8:13</a>) that the Lord had made known that he should become king over Israel, though even then he was not anointed. We must interpret the meaning of the command in accordance with the prophet’s action, judging that he understood what was intended by the words. The word ‘anoint’ is used concerning Jehu and Elisha as well as Hazael; and we know that Elijah did not anoint Elisha, though he could easily have done so, but only made known, by the act of casting his prophetic mantle upon him, that he was called to that office. In the same way then we may understand the rest of the divine order. Elijah was to receive assurance for himself, and to make known that assurance to others, as he found occasion, that God was still ruling Israel both from without and from within, and would call to the throne of Syria one who should execute His judgements upon His rebellious people, and to the throne of Israel one who should destroy Baal and his worship out of the land. We shall not err, it seems, if we suppose that the knowledge, which Elisha had (<a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm" title="And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.">2 Kings 8:13</a>) when he says ‘The Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria,’ was derived from Elijah’s communication, as also the instruction which led him, at a future day (<a href="/context/2_kings/9-1.htm" title="And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, and take this box of oil in your hand, and go to Ramothgilead:...">2 Kings 9:1-2</a>), to send one of the sons of the prophets to Ramoth-Gilead to anoint Jehu. Hence ‘anoint’ in the text becomes equivalent to ‘point them out as the anointed ones.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On Hazael’s wars at a subsequent time with Israel and Judah, see <a href="/context/2_kings/8-28.htm" title="And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram....">2 Kings 8:28-29</a>.

This cannot mean "through the desert to Damascus," for he could not possibly go any other way, nor yet "to the desert (through which he had just come) to Damascus," for he was then in the heart of the desert. He was to find a hiding place - we find the king of Damascus at war with Ahab, ch. 20. - or possibly a sphere for work, - he would be near Hazael - in the rugged desert which stretches south and east of the Syrian capital. (See Stanley, "Sinai and Palestine," p. 410; Porter's "Five Years in Damascus," vol. 2. p. 254 sqq.) Here, too, the prophet would be at no great distance from his own country. See on 1 Kings 17:3]: and  <span class="cmt_word">Wheel thou comest, anoint</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and thou shalt come and anoint</span>. LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The A.V. increases the difficulty. In the Hebrew the <span class="accented">time</span> of the anointing is indefinite. This commission has long been a <span class="accented">crux interpretum</span>. For neither Hazael, nor Jehu, nor Elisha, so far as we have any record, was ever <span class="accented">anointed</span> by Elijah. Elisha was <span class="accented">called</span> by him to the prophetic office. Hazael, it is barely possible, may have been anointed secretly, like David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2, 13</a>), but all that we gather from Scripture is, that he was called in an indirect way, and certainly not anointed, by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-15</a>). Jehu was certainly anointed, but it was neither by Elisha nor Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1, 6</a>), but by one of the sons of the prophets. All we can say, consequently, is that the command was obeyed <span class="accented">in the spirit</span>, and no doubt in the best possible time and way. There may have been good reasons, of which we know nothing, why Elijah should devolve the appointment of the two kings upon his successor, and we can readily understand that the word "<span class="accented">anoint"</span> was, as in <a href="/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, never meant to be construed literally. For in the first place, we have no record elsewhere of the anointing of any <span class="accented">prophet</span>; and secondly, it is remarkable that when Elijah might so easily have anointed Elisha, he did nothing of the kind. It is clear, therefore, that he understood the word to mean "appoint." And the root idea of anointing, it must be remembered, was the <span class="accented">setting apart</span> for the service of God (<a href="/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>). Hence it was (Bahr) that vessels (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a> sqq.), and even stones (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>), were anointed. And when we find that these three persons were set apart sooner or later, and in different ways, to fulfil the high purposes of God, that ought to suffice us. The author of this history clearly found no difficulty in reconciling this account and that of <a href="/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>. It has also been objected to this charge (Rawlinson) that it is no "<span class="accented">explanation</span> or application of the preceding parable." But this is precisely what it appears to have been intended to be. The prophet is here taught by word much the same lesson that had been conveyed by signs, in the preceding vision. No doubt there are additional particulars - the vision dealt only with principles, the charge descends to details and prescribes duties - but still the great lesson that souls are to be won, that God's kingdom is to be advanced, not by wrath and vengeance, by fire and sword, but by meekness and gentleness, through the reason and the conscience, is proclaimed. Hazael and Jehu, each was God's instrument to punish; each was like the sweeping siena or the devouring fire, each was an engine of destruction; but by neither of these were the hearts Of men turned to the Lord. It was the sword of Elisha, the sword of his mouth (cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-16.htm">Revelation 2:16</a>), should constrain men to hide their faces and humble themselves before God] <span class="cmt_word">Hazael</span> [the <span class="accented">seer of God</span>.
