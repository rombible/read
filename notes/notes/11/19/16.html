This apparently imperfect correspondence of the event to the charge, is a strong indication of the historical character of the narrative.<p>The history, indeed, records no actual anointing of Elisha; and it is remarkable that in no other place is any such anointing of a prophet referred to, unless <a href="/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a> be an exception. The anointing, signifying the gift of grace, was first instituted for the priests (<a href="/exodus/40-15.htm" title="And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.">Exodus 40:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-3.htm" title="These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.">Numbers 3:3</a>); next it was extended to the royal office, and became, in common parlance, especially attached to it. The prophetic office, as the third great representative of the power of Jehovah, might well be hallowed by the same ordinance, especially as the prophets dispensed it to the kings; but, whether the prophets were always consecrated with the sacred oil, or whether, as in the Prophet of prophets, the “anointing with the Holy Ghost and with power” sometimes superseded the outward sign, we do not know. Abelmeholah (“the meadow of the dance,” see <a href="/1_kings/4-12.htm" title="Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:">1Kings 4:12</a>) lay in the rich country near the Jordan valley and the plain of Esdraelon; it was therefore on Elijah’s way.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:14-18 God repeated the question, What doest thou here? Then he complained of his discouragement; and whither should God's prophets go with their complaints of that kind, but to their Master? The Lord gave him an answer. He declares that the wicked house of Ahab shall be rooted out, that the people of Israel shall be punished for their sins; and he shows that Elijah was not left alone as he had supposed, and also that a helper should at once be raised up for him. Thus all his complaints are answered and provided for. God's faithful ones are often his hidden ones, Ps 83:3, and the visible church is scarcely to be seen: the wheat is lost in chaff, and the gold in dross, till the sifting, refining, separating day comes. The Lord knows them that are his, though we do not; he sees in secret. When we come to heaven we shall miss many whom we thought to have met there; we shall meet many whom we little thought to have met there. God's love often proves larger than man's charity, and far more extended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehu, the son of Nimshi - In reality the grandson of Nimshi.

He was ‘Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi.’ He was one of Ahab’s captains, and heard the sentence which Elijah pronounced against Ahab for the murder of Naboth (<a href="/context/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;...">2 Kings 9:25-26</a>). When Jehoram had succeeded Ahab, Jehu was anointed and conspired against him, and slew not only Jehoram but also caused to be slain seventy sons of Ahab, and the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and all the worshippers of Baal. For the history of these doings see 2 Kings 10. It is clear that Jehu looked upon himself as God’s ordained instrument, and considered his actions as ‘zeal for the Lord.’ We may therefore conclude that there had been made known to him something of the message which the Lord here gives to Elijah, and that inspired by it, he rose against the house of Ahab. For details of Jehu’s history, see notes on <a href="/2_kings/9-10.htm" title="And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.

Till Elijah is about to be taken up into heaven (2 Kings 2) we read no more of Elisha than is told us in this chapter. He ministered unto Elijah and was ready to attend him on his last journey, and in those days of his ministration he doubtless received all the teaching which God had given to his master, and was made to see how the hand of God was ever working amidst His people.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu</span> [<span class="accented">Jehovah is he</span>.

In these words there was not only the greatest despair expressed as to the existing condition of things, but also a carnal zeal which would gladly have called down the immediate vengeance of the Almighty upon all idolaters. The complaint contained, on the one hand, the tacit reproof that God had looked on quietly for so long a time at the conduct of the ungodly, and had suffered things to come to such an extremity, that he, His prophet, was the only one left of all the true worshippers of God, and, on the other hand, the indirect appeal that He would interpose at last with His penal judgments. Because Elijah had not seen the expected salutary fruits of his zeal for the Lord, he thought that all was lost, and in his gloomy state of mind overlooked what he had seen a short time before with his own eyes, that even in the neighbourhood of the king himself there lived a pious and faithful worshipper of Jehovah, viz., Obadiah, who had concealed a hundred prophets from the revenge of Jezebel, and that the whole of the people assembled upon Carmel had given glory to the Lord, and at his command had seized the prophets of Baal and put them to death, and therefore that the true worshippers of the Lord could not all have vanished out of Israel. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; recalls to mind the zeal of Phinehas (<a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>.), which put an end to the whoredom of the sons of Israel with the daughters of Moab.
