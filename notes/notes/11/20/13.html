It is notable that in all these political functions of prophecy Elijah does not appear, reserving himself for the higher moral and religious mission from God.

The Syrians Are Slain.<p>13-21. behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab&#8212;Though the king and people of Israel had highly offended Him, God had not utterly cast them off. He still cherished designs of mercy towards them, and here, though unasked, gave them a signal proof of His interest in them, by a prophet's animating announcement that the Lord would that day deliver the mighty hosts of the enemy into his hand by means of a small, feeble, inadequate band. Conformably to the prophet's instructions, two hundred thirty-two young men went boldly out towards the camp of the enemy, while seven thousand more, apparently volunteers, followed at some little distance, or posted themselves at the gate, to be ready to reinforce those in front if occasion required it. Ben-hadad and his vassals and princes were already, at that early hour&#8212;scarcely midday&#8212;deep in their cups; and though informed of this advancing company, yet confiding in his numbers, or it may be, excited with wine, he ordered with indifference the proud intruders to be taken alive, whether they came with peaceful or hostile intentions. It was more easily said than done; the young men smote right and left, making terrible havoc among their intended captors; and their attack, together with the sight of the seven thousand, who soon rushed forward to mingle in the fray, created a panic in the Syrian army, who immediately took up flight. Ben-hadad himself escaped the pursuit of the victors on a fleet horse, surrounded by a squadron of horse guards. This glorious victory, won so easily, and with such a paltry force opposed to overwhelming numbers, was granted that Ahab and his people might know (1Ki 20:13) that God is the Lord.

Obadiah had saved a hundred, and no doubt others also escaped. When Elijah complained ‘I, even I only, am left,’ the reason was that, through the persecution, a stop had been put to all prophetic activity. In the present strait we need not doubt that any messenger of good tidings would be welcome. So that there is nothing strange about the prophet’s visit. The national thoughts were occupied on other things than the slaughter of Jehovah’s prophets.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there came a prophet</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one prophet.</span> Cf. <a href="/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>.

Where Elijah was at this time, or why he was not employed, we have no means of determining. Bahr says that he was "least of all suited for such a message," but not if he had learned the lesson of <a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>. At the same time, it is to be remembered that he invariably appears as the minister of wrath. It may also be reasonably asked why this gracious interposition was granted to the kingdom of Samaria at all. Was not this invasion, and would not the sack of the city have been, a  just recompense for the gross corruption of the age, for the persecution of the prophets, etc.? But to this it may be replied that Ben-hadad was not then the instrument which God had designed for the correction of Israel (see <a href="/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>), and furthermore that by his brutal tyranny and despotic demands, he had himself merited a chastisement. The city, too, may have been delivered for the sake of the seven thousand (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-34.htm">2 Kings 19:34</a>. Cf. <a href="/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26</a> sqq.) But this gracious help in the time of extremity was primarily designed as a proof of Jehovah's power over the gods of Syria (cf. vers. 13, 28; <a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a> sqq.), and so as an instrument for the conversion of Israel. His supremacy over the idols of Phoenicia had already been established] <span class="cmt_word">unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?</span> [el. ver. 10. "In Ben-hadad's wars with the Assyrians, we sometimes find him at the head of nearly 100,000 men" (Rawlinson).] <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</span> [This explains to us the <span class="accented">motif</span> of this great deliverance.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>During the siege Benhadad sent messengers into the city to Ahab with this demand: "Thy silver and thy gold are mine, and the best of thy wives and thy sons are mine;" and Ahab answered with pusillanimity: "According to thy word, my lord king, I and all that is mine are thine." Benhadad was made still more audacious by this submissiveness, and sent messengers the second time with the following notice (<a href="/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a>): "Yea, if I send my servants to thee to-morrow at this time, and they search thy house and thy servants' houses, all that is the pleasure of thine eyes they will put into their hands and take." &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean "only  equals  certainly" here (Ewald, 356, b.), for there is neither a negative clause nor an oath, but &#1488;&#1501; signifies if and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the statement, as in <a href="/1_kings/20-5.htm">1 Kings 20:5</a>; so that it is only in the repetition of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; that the emphasis lies, which can be expressed by yea. The words of Ahab in <a href="/1_kings/20-9.htm">1 Kings 20:9</a> show unquestionably that Benhadad demanded more the second time than the first. The words of the first demand, "Thy silver and thy gold," etc., were ambiguous. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-5.htm">1 Kings 20:5</a>, Benhadad meant that Ahab should give him all this; and Ahab had probably understood him as meaning that he was to give him what he required, in order to purchase peace; but Benhadad had, no doubt, from the very first required an unconditional surrender at discretion. He expresses this very clearly in the second demand, since he announces to Ahab the plunder of his palace and also of the palaces of his nobles. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1491; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, all thy costly treasures. It was from this second demand that Ahab first perceived what Benhadad's intention had been; he therefore laid the matter before the elders of the land, i.e., the king's counsellors, <a href="/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a> : "Mark and see that this man seeketh evil," i.e., that he is aiming at our ruin, since he is not contented with the first demand, which I did not refuse him.</body></html>
