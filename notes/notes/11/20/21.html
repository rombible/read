The orders of the proud, drunken king disordered his troops, and prevented them from attacking the Israelites. Those that are most secure, are commonly least courageous.

The Syrians Are Slain.<p>13-21. behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab&#8212;Though the king and people of Israel had highly offended Him, God had not utterly cast them off. He still cherished designs of mercy towards them, and here, though unasked, gave them a signal proof of His interest in them, by a prophet's animating announcement that the Lord would that day deliver the mighty hosts of the enemy into his hand by means of a small, feeble, inadequate band. Conformably to the prophet's instructions, two hundred thirty-two young men went boldly out towards the camp of the enemy, while seven thousand more, apparently volunteers, followed at some little distance, or posted themselves at the gate, to be ready to reinforce those in front if occasion required it. Ben-hadad and his vassals and princes were already, at that early hour&#8212;scarcely midday&#8212;deep in their cups; and though informed of this advancing company, yet confiding in his numbers, or it may be, excited with wine, he ordered with indifference the proud intruders to be taken alive, whether they came with peaceful or hostile intentions. It was more easily said than done; the young men smote right and left, making terrible havoc among their intended captors; and their attack, together with the sight of the seven thousand, who soon rushed forward to mingle in the fray, created a panic in the Syrian army, who immediately took up flight. Ben-hadad himself escaped the pursuit of the victors on a fleet horse, surrounded by a squadron of horse guards. This glorious victory, won so easily, and with such a paltry force opposed to overwhelming numbers, was granted that Ahab and his people might know (1Ki 20:13) that God is the Lord. But we do not read of this acknowledgment being made, or of any sacrifices being offered in token of their national gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Went out, </span> i.e. proceeded further in his march, and fought against them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The horses and chariots, </span> i.e. the men that fought from them, or belonged to them; for so horses and chariots are sometimes taken. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.">1 Samuel 13:5</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king of Israel went out,....
