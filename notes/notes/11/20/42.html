In either case it had no right to stand unauthorised between God’s judgment and him on whom it was pronounced; for even soft-heartedness, as in the case of Eli, may be treason to the cause of righteousness. The prophet (like Elisha, in <a href="/2_kings/13-19.htm" title="And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, You should have smitten five or six times; then had you smitten Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall smite Syria but thrice.">2Kings 13:19</a>) speaks partly as a patriot, jealous—and, as the event proved, with a sagacious jealousy—of the lenity which left the deadly enemy of Israel unsubdued; but he speaks also as the representative of God’s stern and righteous judgment. which Ahab, after signal deliverance, had treated as of no account. (For the fulfilment of his words, see <a href="/context/1_kings/22-34.htm" title="And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: why he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.">1Kings 22:34-36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm" title="And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, Because you have let go out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.">1 Kings 20:42</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, Because, </span>&c. — “What was the great sin of Ahab in this action, for which God so severely punished him?” The great dishonour hereby done to God, in suffering so horrid a blasphemer to go unpunished, which was contrary to an express law, <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm" title="And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.">Leviticus 24:16</a>.

But Ahab was so far from punishing this blasphemer, that he did not so much as rebuke him, but dismissed him upon easy terms, and took not the least care for the reparation of God’s honour. And the people were punished for their own sins, which were many and great; though God took this occasion to inflict the punishment.

Have we not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from an apprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness with him. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often are most abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in both these conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is ill bestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, or even their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophet designed to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punished for sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorer punishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemy and God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy and displeased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had done amiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory. Alas! many that hear the glad tidings of Christ, are busy and there till the day of salvation is gone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man whom I appointed to utter destruction - or to &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#772;rem, i. e., a man on whom My curse had been laid (<a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. a talent of silver&#8212;&pound;342.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Quest.</span> What was the great sin of Ahab in this action for which God so severely punisheth him? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> The great dishonour hereby done to God in suffering so horrid a blasphemer, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/20-23.htm" title="And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.">1 Kings 20:23</a></span>, to go unpunished, which was, contrary to an express law, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm" title="And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.">Leviticus 24:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> What is this to Ben-hadad, seeing that law concerned Israelites only? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> It reached both to them that were <span class="ital">born in the land</span>, and (as is there expressed) <span class="ital">unto strangers</span> that were among them, and in their power, which was Ben-hadad’s case; for God had delivered him into Ahab’s hand for his blasphemy, as he promised to do, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/20-28.htm" title="And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus said the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.">1 Kings 20:28</a></span>, by which act of his providence, especially compared with that law, it was most evident that this man was appointed by God to destruction, as is here said.

The great injury and mischief was hereby done to his own people, who by this most foolish and wicked act were exposed to all those rapines and slaughters which Ben-hadad either did commit, or might have committed, against them afterwards; of which consequently Ahab was guilty. And it must be considered that all the Israelites were the Lord’s peculiar people; nor did their apostacy from God deprive God of his right; and the kings of Israel and Judah had these committed to them, in way of trust, to be governed and protected by them. And therefore Ahab for this gross breach of his trust was justly liable, though not to the censures of his people, yet to the hand of God, who was his King and Governor. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto him, thus saith the Lord,....

It was probably because of this denunciation (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>) that Josephus identifies this prophet with Micaiah, the son of Imlah, "whom Ahab appears to have imprisoned on account of some threatening prophecy (Rawlinson). See <a href="/1_kings/22-9.htm">1 Kings 22:9, 26</a>. For the fulfilment o! this prediction see ch. 22. It has seemed to some writers as if Ahab were here very hardly dealt with for merely gratifying s generous impulse, and dealing magnanimously with a conquered foe. Indeed, there are commentators who see in his release of the cruel and insolent tyrant s "trait which does honour to the heart of Ahab." But it is to be remembered, first, that Ahab was not free to do as he liked in this matter. His victories had been won, not by his prowess, by the skill of his generals, or the valour of his soldiers, but by the power of God alone. The war, that is to say, was God's war: it was begun and continued, and should therefore have been ended, in Him. When even the details of the attack had been ordered of God (ver. 14), surely He should have been consulted as to the disposal of the prisoners. The prophet who promised Divine aid might at any rate have been asked - as prophets constantly were in that age (<a href="/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5, 8</a>) - what was the "word of the Lord" concerning Israel's overbearing and inveterate enemy. But Ahab, who had himself played so craven a part (vers. 21, 31), and who had contributed nothing to these great and unhoped-for victories, nevertheless arrogated to himself their fruits, and thereby ignored and dishonoured God. Secondly, if he had so little regard for his own private interests as to liberate such a man as Ben-hadad, he ought, as trustee for the peace and welfare of Israel, to have acted differently. The demand of ver. 6 should have revealed to him the character of the man he had to deal with. And lastly, he was acting in defiance of all the principles and precedents of the Old Testament dispensation. For one great principle of that dispensation was the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>. The king was the authorized dispenser of rewards and punishments, not only to wicked subjects but to aggressive nations. It was his duty to mete out to them the measure they had served to Israel. And the precedents were all in favour of putting such wretches as this Ben-hadad to the sword (<a href="/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26</a>; <a href="/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>). If he had been the first oppressor who fell into the hands of Israel, Ahab might have had some excuse. But with the fate of Agog, of Adonibezek, of Oreb and Zeeb, in his memory, he ought at any rate to have paused and asked counsel of God before taking Ben-hadad into his chariot and sending him away with a covenant of peace, to reappear at no distant period on the scene as the scourge of the Lord's people.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The verdict of God upon Ahab's conduct towards Benhadad. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/20-36.htm">1 Kings 20:36</a>. A disciple of the prophets received instructions from God, to announce to the king that God would punish him for letting Benhadad go, and to do this, as Nathan had formerly done in the case of David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>.), by means of a symbolical action, whereby the king was led to pronounce sentence upon himself. The disciples of the prophets said to his companion, "in the word of Jehovah," i.e., by virtue of a revelation from God (see at <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), "Smite me;" and when the friend refused to smite him, he announced to him that because of this disobedience to the voice of the Lord, after his departure from him a lion would meet him and smite him, i.e., would kill him; a threat which was immediately fulfilled. This occurrence shows with how severe a punishment all opposition to the commandments of God to the prophets was followed, as a warning for others; just as in the similar occurrence in <a href="/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>. </body></html>
