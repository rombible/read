In this Ahab showed some sparks of virtue remaining in him; in that while Ben-hadad desired only what he had in his own disposal, that is, all his private goods, he complied with his demands; but when all the people and the public good was concerned, he would do nothing without their consent.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Benhadad sent Ahab a very insolent demand. Ahab sent a very disgraceful submission; sin brings men into such straits, by putting them out of the Divine protection. If God do not rule us, our enemies shall: guilt dispirits men, and makes them cowards. Ahab became desperate. Men will part with their most pleasant things, those they most love, to save their lives; yet they lose their souls rather than part with any pleasure or interest to prevent it. Here is one of the wisest sayings that ever Ahab spake, and it is a good lesson to all. It is folly to boast of any day to come, since we know not what it may bring forth. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by self-confidence. Happy is the man who is never off his watch.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The political institution of a Council of elders (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>, etc.), which had belonged to the undivided nation from the sojourn in Egypt downward, had therefore been continued among the ten tribes after their separation, and still held an important place in the system of Government. The Council was not merely called together when the king needed it, but held its regular sittings at the seat of government; and hence, "all the elders of the land" were now present in Samaria. On the "elders of towns," see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8-14</a>.<p>Apparently the king had not thought it necessary to summon the Council when the first terms were announced to him, inasmuch as they touched only himself. The fresh demands affected the people at large, and it became necessary, or at any rate fitting, that "the elders" should be consulted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-12. Thus said Ben-hadad, Thy silver and thy gold is mine&#8212;To this message sent him during the siege, Ahab returned a tame and submissive answer, probably thinking it meant no more than an exaction of tribute. But the demand was repeated with greater insolence; and yet, from the abject character of Ahab, there is reason to believe he would have yielded to this arrogant claim also, had not the voice of his subjects been raised against it. Ben-hadad's object in these and other boastful menaces was to intimidate Ahab. But the weak sovereign began to show a little more spirit, as appears in his abandoning "my lord the king" for the single "tell him," and giving him a dry but sarcastic hint to glory no more till the victory is won. Kindling into a rage at the cool defiance, Ben-hadad gave orders for the immediate sack of the city.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The elders of the land; </span> whose counsel and concurrence he now desires in his distress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">See how this man seeketh mischief; </span> though he pretended peace, and a friendly agreement upon these terms propounded, it is apparent by those additional demands that he intends nothing less than our utter ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I denied him not; </span> I granted his demands in the sense before mentioned. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the King of Israel called all the elders of the land,.... His poor sneaking spirit was a little aroused with the last message, and therefore called a council of the elders of the people upon it, which was a piece of wisdom in him: <p>and said, mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief; nothing less than the entire ruin of the nation: <p>for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I denied him not; in the sense he understood him, which was, that he was to be a vassal, and tributary to him, for the sake of holding these, which yet was very mean; but he wanted to have these in hand, and not them only, but the pillaging of all his subjects. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">called all the elders of the land</span>] It was more than a gathering of the chief men of the city. Probably at such a crisis many of the principal persons who dwelt at other times away from the fortified cities would have gathered in Samaria for safety. It was with all these that Ahab conferred. Josephus represents the king as gathering <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλῆθος</span>, ‘the bulk of the people.’ This can hardly have been thought necessary, nor is it at all after the manner of Eastern monarchs. The treasures which were now threatened would be the possessions of the principal men, and to them the king would appeal for advice. It is however mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/20-8.htm" title="And all the elders and all the people said to him, Listen not to him, nor consent.">1 Kings 20:8</a> that all the people agreed to the decision that Ben-hadad’s demand should be rejected. Ahab’s sentence is left unconcluded, but the conclusion suggests itself without being spoken. It would have run somewhat thus, “But now he threatens to seize your treasures as well as mine, tell me what answer I shall send to him.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land</span> [Bahr remarks that this expression, compared with "the elders of the city" (<a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8</a>, etc.), suggests either that these nobles, as the highest officials, had their residences at the court, or upon the approach of Ben-hadad had betaken themselves thither with their treasures.
