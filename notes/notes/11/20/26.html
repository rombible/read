They take it for granted that it was not Israel, but Israel's gods, that beat them; but they speak very ignorantly of Jehovah. They supposed that Israel had many gods, to whom they ascribed limited power within a certain district; thus vain were the Gentiles in their imaginations concerning God.

This Aphek has been almost certainly identified with the modern Fik, a large village on the present high road from Damascus to Nablous and Jersalem. The expression "went up to Aphek" is appropriate, for Fik, though in a level country, is at a much higher elevation than Damascus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-26. the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said&#8212;The same prophet who had predicted the victory shortly reappeared, admonishing the king to take every precaution against a renewal of hostilities in the following campaign.<p>at the return of the year&#8212;that is, in spring, when, on the cessation of the rainy season, military campaigns (2Sa 11:1), were anciently begun. It happened as the prophet had forewarned. Brooding over their late disastrous defeat, the attendants of Ben-hadad ascribed the misfortune to two causes&#8212;the one arose from the principles of heathenism which led them to consider the gods of Israel as "gods of the hills"; whereas their power to aid the Israelites would be gone if the battle was maintained on the plains. The other cause to which the Syrian courtiers traced their defeat at Samaria, was the presence of the tributary kings, who had probably been the first to take flight; and they recommended "captains to be put in their rooms." Approving of these recommendations, Ben-hadad renewed his invasion of Israel the next spring by the siege of Aphek in the valley of Jezreel (compare 1Sa 29:1, with 1Sa 28:4), not far from En-dor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not that <span class="ital">Aphek</span> in Judah, of which <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/13-4.htm" title="From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians to Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:">Joshua 13:4</a> <a href="/joshua/15-31.htm" title="And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,">Joshua 15:31</a></span>; but that in Asher, of which <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/19-30.htm" title="Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.">Joshua 19:30</a> <a href="/judges/1-31.htm" title="Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:">Judges 1:31</a></span>, nigh unto which was the great plain of Galilee.

Another was in the hill country on the east of the sea of Galilee. But as Ben-hadad’s policy was to fight in the plain, the Aphek here intended must be the city of that name which lay in the plain of Jezreel. On the fitness of this place for a large encampment cf. <a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.">1 Samuel 29:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Syria</span>], <span class="cmt_word">and went up to Aphek</span> [As the word signifies "fortress," it is only natural that several different places should bear this name, and the commentators are not agreed as to which of them is here intended.

This trans-Jordanic Aphek is new represented by the village of <span class="accented">Fik</span>, six miles east  of the sea of Galilee, and standing, as Aphek must have then stood, on the high road between Damascus and Jerusalem. On the whole, the balance of probability inclines to the latter. It would follow hence that the Israelites, emboldened by their victory of the preceding year, had crossed the river to meet the enemy], to fight against Israel.
