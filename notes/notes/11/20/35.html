This tradition, or conjecture, agrees well with the subsequent narrative in 1 Kings 22.<p><span class= "bld">The sons of the prophets.</span>—This phrase, constantly recurring in the history of Elijah and Elisha, first appears here. But the thing designated is apparently as old as the days of Samuel who is evidently surrounded by “a company” of disciples. (See <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-20.htm" title="And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.">1Samuel 19:20</a>.) The prophetic office seems never to have been, like the priesthood or kingship, hereditary. “Sonship,” therefore, no doubt means simply discipleship; and it is likely enough that the schools of the sons of the prophets were places of higher religious education, including many who did not look for the prophetic vocation; although the well-known words of Amos (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14</a>), “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son,” clearly indicate that from their ranks, generally though not invariably, the prophets were called. Probably the institution had fallen into disuse, and had been revived to seal and to secure the prophetic victory over Baal-worship. To Elijah the “sons of the prophets” look up with awe and some terror; to Elisha, with affectionate respect and trust.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm" title="And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you.

Have we not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from an apprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness with him. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often are most abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in both these conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is ill bestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, or even their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophet designed to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punished for sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorer punishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemy and God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy and displeased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had done amiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory.

It signifies (marginal references), the schools or colleges of prophets which existed in several of the Israelite, and probably of the Jewish, towns, where young men were regularly educated for the prophetical office. These "schools" make their first appearance under Samuel <a href="/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>. There is no distinct evidence that they continued later than the time of Elisha; but it is on the whole most probable that the institution survived the captivity, and that the bulk of the "prophets," whose works have come down to us belonged to them. Amos Amo 7:14-15 seems to speak as if his were an exceptional case.<p>Said unto his neighbor - Rather, "to his friend" or "companion " - to one who was, like himself, "a prophet's son," and who ought therefore to have perceived that his colleague spoke "in the word of the Lord." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 20:35-42.

The prophet found a willing assistant, and then, waiting for Ahab, leads the king unconsciously, in the parabolic manner of Nathan (2Sa 12:1-4), to pronounce his own doom; and this consequent punishment was forthwith announced by a prophet (see on [322]1Ki 21:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto his neighbour, </span> or brother; another son of the prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the word of the Lord; </span> in the name and by the command of God, whereof doubtless he had informed him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Smite me, </span> so as to wound me, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/20-37.htm" title="Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray you.

A prophetic message rebuking Ahab because he had let Ben-hadad go (Not in Chronicles)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">35</span>. <span class="ital">a certain man of the sons of the prophets</span>] It is clear from what follows in the history (2 Kings 2) about the taking of Elijah into heaven, that in spite of Jezebel’s persecution, the prophets and their schools were not put down, but still flourished in various places. Josephus represents this ‘son of the prophets’ as Micaiah, spoken of in <a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.">1 Kings 22:8</a>, and says that it was in consequence of this message about Ben-hadad’s deliverance that Ahab put him in prison.

Hence his sin in refusing to comply with it. ‘Fellow’ gives the idea of men of the same guild better than ‘neighbour’. The expression ‘by the word of the Lord’ is found in a similar passage (<a href="/1_kings/13-17.htm" title="For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.">1 Kings 13:17</a>), and is the more usual form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Smite me</span>] He wished to personate a man who had been engaged in the battle and had suffered something from the enemy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the man refused</span>] Such a refusal was utterly at variance with the character of a prophet, who was to be prepared to obey at all costs a message which came as the word of the Lord. His companion puts the case very strongly in the next verse when he calls his own request ‘the voice of the Lord’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one man</span>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>, note] <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sons</span> of <span class="cmt_word">the prophets</span> [Here mentioned for the first time, though the prophetic schools probably owed their existence, certainly their development, to Samuel.

For this use of "son," cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a> ("a son of death"); <a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-2.htm">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>, and <a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>.

The word, again, does not necessarily imply youth. That they were sometimes married men appears from <a href="/2_kings/6-1.htm">2 Kings 6:1</a>, though this was probably after their collegiate life was ended.

Another <span class="accented">prophet is</span> implied. It was because this "neighbour" was a prophet that his disregard of the word of the Lord was so sinful, and received such severe punishment], <span class="cmt_word">in the word of the Lord</span> [see on 1 Kings 13:1], <span class="cmt_word">Smite me, I pray thee.</span> [Why the prophet, in order to the accomplishment of his mission - which was to obtain from Ahab's own lips a confession of his deserts - why he should have been smitten, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, bruised and wounded, is not quite clear. For it is obvious that he might have sustained his part, told his story, and obtained a judgment from the king, without proceeding to such painful extremities. It is quite true that a person thus wounded would perhaps sustain the part of one who had been in battle <span class="accented">better</span>, but the wounds were in no way necessary to his disguise, and men do not court pain without imperious reasons. Besides, it was "in the word of the Lord" that these wounds were sought and received. It is quite clear, therefore, that it cannot have been merely to give him a claim to an audience with the king (Ewald) - he could easily have simulated wounds by means of bandages, which would at the same time have helped to disguise him - or that he might foreshadow in his own person the wounding which Ahab would receive (<a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>), for of that he says nothing, or for any similar reason. The wounding, we may be quite sure, and the tragical circumstances connected therewith, are essential parts of the parable this prophet had to act, of the lesson he had to teach. 1%w the great lesson he had to convey, not to the king alone, but to the prophetic order and to the whole country, the lesson most necessary in that lawless age, was that of implicit unquestioning obedience to the Divine law. Ahab had just transgressed that law. He had "let go a man whom God had appointed to utter destruction;" he had heaped honours on the oppressor of his country, and in gratifying benevolent impulses had ignored the will and counsel of God (see on ver. 42). No doubt it seemed to him, as it has seemed to others since, that he had acted with rare magnanimity, and that his generosity in that age, an age which showed no mercy to the fallen, was unexampled. But he must be taught that he has no right to be generous at the expense of others; that God's will must be done even when it goes against the grain, when it contradicts impulses of kindness, and demands painful sacrifices. He is taught this by the prophetic word (ver. 42), but much more effectively by the actions which preceded it. A prophet required to smite a brother prophet, and that for no apparent reason, would no doubt find it repugnant to his feelings to do so; it would seem to him hard and cruel and shameful to smite a companion. But the prophet who refused to do this, who followed his benevolent impulses in preference to the word of the Lord, died for his sin - died  forthwith by the visitation of God. What a lesson was this to king and country - for no doubt the incident would be bruited abroad, and the very strangeness of the whole proceeding would heighten the impression it made. Indeed, it is hardly possible to conceive a way in which the duty of unquestioning obedience could be more emphatically taught. When this prophet appeared before the king, a man had smitten and wounded him, disagreeable and painful as the task must have been, because of the word of the Lord; whilst a brother prophet, who declined the office because it was painful, had been slain by a wild beast. It is easy to see that there was here a solemn lesson for the king, and that the wounding gave it its edge.] <span class="cmt_word">And the man refused to smite him.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After seven days the battle was fought.

The flying Syrians had probably some of them climbed the wall of the city to offer resistance to the Israelites in pursuit, and some of them sought to defend themselves by taking shelter behind it. And during the conflict, through the special interposition of God, the wall fell and buried the Syrians who were there. The cause of the fall is not given. Thenius assumes that it was undermined, in order to remove all idea of any miraculous working of the omnipotence of God. Benhadad himself fled into the city "room to room," i.e., from one room to another (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-25.htm">1 Kings 22:25</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-24.htm">2 Chronicles 18:24</a>). </body></html>
