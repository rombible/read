Have we not found him so? That is gospel repentance, which flows from an apprehension of the mercy of God, in Christ; there is forgiveness with him. What a change is here! The most haughty in prosperity often are most abject in adversity; an evil spirit will thus affect a man in both these conditions. There are those on whom, like Ahab, success is ill bestowed; they know not how to serve either God or their generation, or even their own true interests with their prosperity: Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness. The prophet designed to reprove Ahab by a parable. If a good prophet were punished for sparing his friend and God's when God said, Smite, of much sorer punishment should a wicked king be thought worthy, who spared his enemy and God's, when God said, Smite. Ahab went to his house, heavy and displeased, not truly penitent, or seeking to undo what he had done amiss; every way out of humour, notwithstanding his victory. Alas! many that hear the glad tidings of Christ, are busy and there till the day of salvation is gone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ashes - Rather, "a bandage" (and in <a href="/1_kings/20-41.htm">1 Kings 20:41</a>).

The refusal of his neighbor to smite the prophet was manifestly wrong, as it was a withholding of necessary aid to a prophet in the discharge of a duty to which he had been called by God, and it was severely punished [1Ki 20:36], as a beacon to warn others (see on [321]1Ki 13:2-24). The prophet found a willing assistant, and then, waiting for Ahab, leads the king unconsciously, in the parabolic manner of Nathan (2Sa 12:1-4), to pronounce his own doom; and this consequent punishment was forthwith announced by a prophet (see on [322]1Ki 21:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">That he might sooner gain access to the king, and audience from him</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm" title="And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you.

They clothed themselves in mourning apparel, and put ropes on their necks, as a sign of absolute surrender, and went to Ahab, praying for the life of their king. And Ahab felt so flattered by the fact that his powerful opponent was obliged to come and entreat his favour in this humble manner, that he gave him his life, without considering how a similar act on the part of Saul had been blamed by the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>.).
