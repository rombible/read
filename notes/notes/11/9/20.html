The most notable example of it is the case of the Gibeonites (<a href="/context/joshua/9-21.htm" title="And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.">Joshua 9:21-27</a>); but there are incidental notices of similar imposition of serfship in <a href="/judges/1-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.">Judges 1:28</a>; <a href="/judges/1-30.htm" title="Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelled among them, and became tributaries.">Judges 1:30</a>; <a href="/judges/1-33.htm" title="Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries to them.">Judges 1:33</a>; <a href="/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Judges 1:35</a>. Many of the dangers of the stormy age of the Judges were due to the uprising of these subject races; as in the revival of the northern confederacy at Hazor under Sisera (Judges 4), and the usurpation of Abimelech by aid of the Shecliemites (Judges 9). Probably their subordination to Israel varied according to the strength or weakness of each age; but, when the monarchy became organised under David and Solomon, it was fixed definitely and permanently, although, like the serfship of the Middle Ages, it might vary in its severity in different times and in different regions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,...">1 Kings 9:20-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">All the people that were left of the Amorites — </span>Who, it is likely, by this time were become proselytes to the Jewish religion, as the Gibeonites were, or at least renounced their idolatry. <span class="ital">Upon those did Solomon levy a tribute — </span>He used them as bond-men, and imposed bodily labours upon them. “But why did not Solomon destroy them, as God had commanded, when now it was fully in his power to do so?” The command to destroy them, (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm" title="And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall smite them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>,) did chiefly, if not only, concern that generation of Canaanites who lived in or near the time of the Israelites entering into Canaan.

Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce.

But a distinction was made between these people and the people of Israel, now that Solomon was powerful enough to enforce it, in the kind of service they must render and the tribute they must bear.

These resources were: (1) his connection with king Hiram, who furnished him with building materials (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-14</a>); (2) the tributary labour which he raised in his kingdom (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-25</a>); (3) the maritime expedition to Ophir, which brought him great wealth (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>). But these notices are very condensed, and, as a comparison with the parallel account in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a> shows, are simply incomplete extracts from a more elaborate history. In the account of the tributary labour, the enumeration of the cities finished and fortified (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>) is interpolated; and the information concerning the support which was rendered to Solomon in the erection of his buildings by Hiram (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14</a>), is merely supplementary to the account already given in <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a> point still more clearly to an earlier account, since they would be otherwise unintelligible. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a> the arrangement is a simpler one: the buildings are first of all enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-1.htm">2 Chronicles 8:1-6</a>, and the account of the tributary labour follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7-11</a>.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-14</a><p>The notices concerning Solomon's connection with Hiram are very imperfect; for <a href="/1_kings/9-14.htm">1 Kings 9:14</a> does not furnish a conclusion either in form or substance.

Hiram had supported Solomon according to his desire with cedar wood and cypress wood, and with gold; and Solomon gave him in return, after his buildings were completed, twenty cities in the land of Galil. But these cities did not please Hiram. When he went out to see them, he said, "What kind of cities are these (&#1502;&#1492; in a contemptuous sense) which thou hast given me, my brother?" &#1488;&#1495;&#1493; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-32.htm">1 Kings 20:32</a>, 1 Macc. 10:18; 11:30, 2 Macc. 11:22, as a conventional expression used by princes in their intercourse with one another. "And he called the land Cabul unto this day;" i.e., it retained this name even to later times. The land of Galil is a part of the country which was afterwards known as Galilaea, namely, the northern portion of it, as is evident from the fact that in <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>, Kedes in the mountains of Naphtali, to the north-west of Lake Huleh, is distinguished from the kadesh in southern Palestine by the epithet &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;. It is still more evident from <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> and Galil embraced the northern part of the tribe of Naphtali; whilst the expression used by Isaiah, &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, also shows that this district was for the most part inhabited by heathen (i.e., non-Israelites). The twenty cities in Galil, which Solomon gave to Hiram, certainly belonged therefore to the cities of the Canaanites mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a>; that is to say, they were cities occupied chiefly by a heathen population, and in all probability they were in a very bad condition. Consequently they did not please Hiram, and he gave to the district the contemptuous name of the land of Cabul. Of the various interpretations given to the word Cabul (see Ges. Thes. p. 656), the one proposed by Hiller (Onomast. p. 435), and adopted by Reland, Ges., Maurer, and others, viz., that it is a contraction of &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, sicut id quod evanuit tanquam nihil, has the most to support it, since this is the meaning required by the context. At the same time it is possible, and even probable, that it had originally a different signification, and is derived from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; in the sense of to pawn, as Gesenius and Dietrich suppose. This is favoured by the occurrence of the name Cabul in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>, where it is probably derivable from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, to fetter, and signifies literally a fortress or castle; but in this instance it has no connection with the land of Cabul, since it is still preserved in the village of Cabul to the south-east of Acre (see the Comm. on Josh. l.c.). The "land of Cabul" would therefore mean the pawned land; and in the mouths of the people this would be twisted into "good for nothing." In this case &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; would have to be taken impersonally: "they called;" and the notice respecting this name would be simply an explanation of the way in which the people interpreted it. Hiram, however, did not retain this district, but gave it back to Solomon, who then completed the cities (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>).<p>(Note: This simple method of reconciling the account before us with the apparently discrepant notice in the Chronicles, concerning which even Movers (die biblische Chronik, p. 159) observes, that the chronicler interpolated it from a second (?) source, is so natural, that it is difficult to conceive how Bertheau can object to it; since he admits that the accounts in the books of Kings and Chronicles are incomplete extracts from common and more elaborate sources.)<p>The only way in which we can give to <a href="/1_kings/9-14.htm">1 Kings 9:14</a> a meaning in harmony with the context, is by taking it as a supplementary explanation of &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;...&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;...&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>, and so rendering &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; as a pluperfect, as in <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a> : "Hiram had sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold." If we reckon the value of gold as being ten times the worth of silver, a hundred and twenty talents of gold would be 3,141, 600 thalers (about 471,240: Tr.). This is no doubt to be regarded as a loan, which Solomon obtained from Hiram to enable him to complete his buildings. Although David may have collected together the requisite amount of precious metals for the building of the temple, and Solomon had also very considerable yearly revenues, derived partly from tribute paid by subjugated nations and partly from trade, his buildings were so extensive, inasmuch as he erected a large number of cities beside the temple and his splendid palace (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>), that his revenues might not suffice for the completion of these costly works; and therefore, since he would not apply the consecrated treasures of the temple to the erection of cities and palaces, he might find himself compelled to procure a loan from the wealthy king Hiram, which he probably intended to cover by ceding to him twenty cities on the border of the Phoenician territory. But as these cities did not please the king of Tyre and he gave them back to Solomon, the latter will no doubt have repaid the amount borrowed during the last twenty years of his reign.</body></html>
