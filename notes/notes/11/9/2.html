The fact seems to be that, though the temple was finished in Solomon's eleventh year, the dedication did not take place until his twenty-fourth year. The order of the narrative in Kings agrees with this view, since it interposes the account of the building of the palace <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1-12</a>, and of the making of the furniture <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-51</a>, between the completion of the building of the temple <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a> and the ceremony of the Dedication <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The strain of it corresponds to this view, for it consists of direct answers to his solemn inaugural prayer (1Ki 9:3 is in answer to 1Ki 8:29; 1Ki 9:4, 5 is in answer to 1Ki 8:25, 26; 1Ki 9:6-9 to 1Ki 8:33-46; see also De 29:22-24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, in a dream or vision; for that which is mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/6-11.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,">1 Kings 6:11</a></span>, seems to have been imparted unto him by some prophet or messenger sent from God with that errand. The time of this revelation was either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. After all Solomon’s buildings, as the words thus rendered plainly imply. And if it seem strange that God should not reveal this purpose and sentence of his concerning the temple till so many years after the finishing of it, it must be considered, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That as it is an act of God’s singular grace when he doth thus reveal himself to any person, so it is but meet he should choose his own time for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

That God might choose this as the fittest time for giving Solomon the following admonition, when he perceived that his heart befall to be lifted up in pride for his sumptuous and magnificent buildings, &c., and that he was grown vain, and careless, and secure; and therefore most needed such all awakening oracle. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Presently after the building of the temple, as may be thought from the matter of this revelation, which seems best to suit with that time when it was newly built, and when Solomon’s prayer here mentioned was newly made; for seeing the following words contain God’s answer to that prayer, it seems improbable, that the answer should come so many years after it. But then this second verse, and the rest, even to <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm" title="(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.">1 Kings 9:11</a></span>, are to be enclosed with a parenthesis; and the place must be thus rendered, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/9-2.htm" title="That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.">1 Kings 9:2</a></span>, <span class="ital">For</span> (so the Hebrew <span class="ital">vau</span> is oft rendered) <span class="ital">the Lord appeared, or had appeared, to Solomon</span>, &c.; <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have hallowed this house, which you have built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.">1 Kings 9:3</a></span>, <span class="ital">And the Lord had said unto him</span>, &c.

The dedicatory prayer was followed by a magnificent sacrifice offered by the king and all Israel. The thank-offering (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;) consisted, in accordance with the magnitude of the manifestation of divine grace, of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. This enormous number of sacrificial animals, in which J. D. Michaelis found serious difficulties, Thenius endeavours to set aside as too large, by calculating that as these sacrifices were offered in seven days, reckoning the sacrificial day at twelve full hours, there must have been about five oxen and about twenty-five sheep slaughtered and offered in sacrifice every minute for the king alone. This calculation would be conclusive, if there were any foundation for the three assumptions upon which it rests: namely, (1) that the number of sacrifices mentioned was offered for the king alone; (2) that the slaughtering and preparation of the sacrificial animals could only be performed by the priests and Levites; and (3) that the whole of the flesh of these sacrificial animals was to be consumed upon the altar. But these three assumptions are all erroneous. There is nothing in the account about their being "for the king alone." For it is obvious that the words "and Solomon offered a sacrifice" are not to be understood as signifying that the king had these sacrifices offered for himself alone, but that the words refer to the sacrifices offered by the king and all Israel for the consecration of the temple, from the simple fact that in <a href="/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62</a> "Solomon and all Israel" are expressly mentioned as offering sacrifice, and that after the statement of the number of the sacrifices we find these words in <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a> : "so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah." Moreover it is very evident from the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> and 3 that at the offering of sacrifice the slaughtering, flaying, and preparation of the sacrificial animals were performed by any Israelite, and that it was only the sprinkling of the blood against the altar and the burning of the sacrificial portions upon the altar which were the exclusive province of the priests. In order to form a correct idea of the enormous number of sacrifices which could be slaughtered on any one day we will refer again to the notice in Josephus (Bell. Jud. vi. 9, 3) already mentioned in the Comm. on the Pentateuch, p. 683 (translation), that in the reign of the emperor Nero the procurator Cestius directed the priests to count the number of the paschal lambs, and that they counted 250,000, which were slaughtered for the passover between the ninth and eleventh hours of the day, and of which the blood was sprinkled upon the altar. If then it was possible at that time to slaughter more than 250,000 lambs in three hours of the afternoon, and to sprinkle the blood upon the altar, there can have been no difficulty in slaughtering and sacrificing 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep at the dedication of the temple on each of the seven days of the festival. As all Israel from Hamath to the brook of Egypt came to Jerusalem to this festival, we shall not be above the mark if we estimate the number of the heads of houses present at 100,000. And with very little trouble they could have slaughtered 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep a day and prepared them for sacrificing. How many priests took an active part in this, we do not indeed know, in fact we have no information as to the number of the priests in Solomon's time; but we know that in the time of David the number of Levites qualified for service, reckoning from their thirtieth year, was 38,000, so that we may certainly assume that there were two or three thousand priests. Now if only the half of these Levites and priests had come to Jerusalem to the dedication of the temple, they alone could have slaughtered 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep every day. And would not a thousand priests have been sufficient to sprinkle the blood of so many animals upon the altar and to turn the fat between the morning and evening sacrifice? If we divided these sacrifices among a thousand priests, each one would only have had to attend to the sprinkling of the blood and burning of the fat of three oxen and eighteen sheep each day. - But the brazen altar of burnt-offering might not have been large enough for the burning of so many sacrifices, notwithstanding the fact that only the fat portions of the thank-offerings were consumed, and they did not require much room; since the morning and evening burnt-offerings were added daily, and as festal offerings they would certainly not consist of a lamb only, but at least of one bullock, and they were burned whole, although the altar of burnt-offering with a surface of 144 square yards (see my bibl. Archol. i. p. 127) would hold a very large quantity of sacrificial flesh at once. In v. 64, however, it is expressly stated that Solomon sanctified the middle of the court, which was before the house of Jehovah, to burn the burnt-offering and meat-offering and the fat portions of the thank-offerings there, because the brazen altar was too small to hold these sacrifices. "The middle of the court" (&#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498;) is the whole of the inner portion of the court of the priests, which was in front of the temple-house and formed the centre of the court surrounding the temple. Of course we have not to imagine that the sacrifices were offered upon the stone pavement of the court, but must assume that there were auxiliary altars erected in the inner court around the brazen altar. By the burnt-offering and the meat-offering (belonging to it: &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;) we are not to understand certain burnt-offerings, which were offered for a definite number of thank-offerings, as Thenius supposes. The singular and the definite article are both at variance with this. The reference is rather to the (well-known) daily morning and evening burnt-offerings with their meat-offering, and in this case, no doubt, to such a festal sacrifice as is prescribed in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> for the great yearly feasts. </body></html>
