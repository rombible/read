The western portion of this territory would lie nearly on the frontiers of Tyre, and so would suit well the purpose both of Hiram and of Solomon. The discontent of Hiram probably referred to the condition of the cities (which afterwards had to be rebuilt), not to their geographical position.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:10-14 Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities.

Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee&#8212;According to Josephus, they were situated on the northwest of it, adjacent to Tyre. Though lying within the boundaries of the promised land (Ge 15:18; Jos 1:4), they had never been conquered till then, and were inhabited by Canaanite heathens (Jud 4:2-13; 2Ki 15:29). They were probably given to Hiram, whose dominions were small, as a remuneration for his important services in furnishing workmen, materials, and an immense quantity of wrought gold (1Ki 9:14) for the temple and other buildings [Michaelis]. The gold, however, as others think, may have been the amount of forfeits paid to Solomon by Hiram for not being able to answer the riddles and apothegms, with which, according to Josephus, in their private correspondence, the two sovereigns amused themselves. Hiram having refused these cities, probably on account of their inland situation making them unsuitable to his maritime and commercial people, Solomon satisfied his ally in some other way; and, taking these cities into his own hands, he first repaired their shattered walls, then filled them with a colony of Hebrews (2Ch 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He did not accept them for satisfaction, because the cities were out of repair, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/9-13.htm" title="And he said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?

It has been conjectured that Hiram had hoped for the noble bay of Acco or Ptolemais (Milman, Rawlinson), but surely he had seaboard enough already. It was rather corn lands he would most need and desire. His disappointment is amply accounted for by the fact that the country assigned him was a hungry and mountainous, and therefore comparatively useless, tract. "The region lay on the summit of a broad mountain ridge" (Porter).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a> contain the special answer to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-26.htm">1 Kings 8:26</a>. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6-9</a> refer to the prayer for the turning away of the curse, to which the Lord replies: If ye and your children turn away from me, and do not keep my commandments, but worship other gods, this house will not protect you from the curses threatened in the law, but they will be fulfilled in all their terrible force upon you and upon this temple. This threat follows the Pentateuch exactly in the words in which it is expressed; <a href="/1_kings/9-7.htm">1 Kings 9:7</a> being founded upon <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>, and the curse pronounced upon Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23-26</a> being transferred to the temple in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-9.htm">1 Kings 9:9</a>. -  &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, to dismiss, i.e., to reject from before my face. "This house will be &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;," i.e., will stand high, or through its rejection will be a lofty example for all that pass by. The temple stood upon a high mountain, so that its ruins could not fail to attract the attention of all who went past. The expression &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is selected with an implied allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>. God there promises to make Israel &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, high, exalted above all nations. This blessing will be turned into a curse. The temple, which was high and widely renowned, shall continue to be high, but in the opposite sense, as an example of the rejection of Israel from the presence of God.<p>(Note: The conjecture of Bttcher, Thenius, and Bertheau, that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; should be altered into &#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, has no support in <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>, and has all the ancient versions against it; for they all contain the Masoretic text, either in a verbal translation (lxx), or in a paraphrase, as for example the Chaldee, "the house that was high shall be destroyed;" the Syriac and Arabic, "this house will be destroyed;" and the Vulgate, domus haec erit in exemplum. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/7-21.htm">2 Chronicles 7:21</a> the thought is somewhat varied by the alteration of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; into &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. For it would never enter the mind of any sober critic to attribute this variation to a misinterpretation of our text. Still less can it be an unsuccessful attempt to explain or rectify our text, as Bttcher imagines, since the assertion of this critic, that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is only used to signify an exalted position, and never the exaltation of dignity or worth, is proved to be erroneous by <a href="/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>.) </body></html>
