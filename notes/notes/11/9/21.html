He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest. Wisdom is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold, Pr 3:14.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

In accomplishing these and various other works which were carried on throughout the kingdom, especially in the north, where Rezon of Damascus, his enemy, might prove dangerous, he employed vast numbers of the Canaanites as galley slaves (2Ch 2:18), treating them as prisoners of war, who were compelled to do the drudgery and hard labor, while the Israelites were only engaged in honorable employment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He used them as bond-men, and imposed burdens and bodily labours upon them.

(Cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3-10</a>.) The other means by which Solomon made it possible to erect so many buildings, was by compelling the remnants of the Canaanitish population that were still in the land to perform tributary labour. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1491;, "this is the case with regard to the tribute." For &#1502;&#1505; &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; compare <a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>. To the announcement of the object which Solomon had in view in raising tributary labourers, namely, to build, etc., there is immediately appended a list of all the buildings completed by him (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>); and it is not till <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a> that we have more precise details concerning the tribute itself. Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, and the cities enumerated, are for the most part not new buildings, but simply fortifications, or the completion of buildings already in existence. David had already built the castle of Millo and the wall of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>); so that Solomon's building was in both cases merely fortifying more strongly. On Millo see the fuller remarks at <a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; and on the building of the wall, those at <a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a> and <a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>. As Solomon thereby closed the breach of the city of David according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>, he probably extended the city wall so as to enclose the temple mountain; and he may possibly have also surrounded the lower city with a wall, since David had only built a fortification round about the upper city upon Zion (see at <a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>). - Hazor: an old royal city of the Canaanites above Lake Huleh, which has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>). Megiddo, i.e., Lejun (see at <a href="/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>). Gezer: also an old Canaanitish royal city, which stood close to the Philistian frontier, probably on the site of the present village of el Kubab (see at <a href="/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>).</body></html>
