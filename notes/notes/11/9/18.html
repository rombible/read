Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce.

That the latter place, or Palmyra, was meant appears, first, from the distinct statement of Chronicles <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a> that Solomon built Tadmor, and the improbability that the fact would be omitted in Kings; secondly, from the strong likelihood that Solomon, with his wide views of commerce, would seize and fortify the Palmy-rene Oasis: and thirdly, from the unanimity of the old versions in rendering Tamar here by Tadmor. The probability seems to be that Tamar was the original name of the place, being the Hebrew word for "a palm," from where it is generally agreed that the town derived its name. Tadmor was a corrupt or dialectic variety of the word, which was adopted at the city itself, and prevailed over the original appellation. No reference is found to Tadmor in the Assyrian inscriptions, or in any Classical writer before Pliny. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Tamar signifies a palm tree, from whence this city had its name Palmyra, the situation of which place agrees with this; hence we read both in Ptolemy (q) and Pliny (r) of the Palmyrene deserts: the ruins of it are to be seen to this day, and of it this account is given; that it is enclosed on three sides with long ridges of mountains, which open towards the east gradually, to the distance of about an hour's riding; but to the south stretches a vast plain, beyond the reach of the eye; the air is good, but the soil exceeding barren; nothing green to be seen therein, save some few palm trees in the gardens, and here and there about the town; and from these trees, I conceive, says my author, it obtained its name both in Hebrew and in Latin: it appears to have been of a large extent, by the space now taken up by the ruins; but there are no footsteps of any wall remaining, nor is it possible to judge of the ancient figure of the place. The present inhabitants, as they are poor, miserable, dirty people, so they have shut themselves up, to the number of about thirty or forty families, in little huts made of dirt, within the walls of a spacious court, which enclosed a most magnificent Heathen temple (s). Benjamin of Tudela says (t), it is situated in a wilderness, far from any habitable place, and is four days' journey from Baalath before mentioned; which place he takes to be the same with Baalbek, in the valley of Lebanon, built by Solomon for Pharaoh's daughter; which, according to the Arabic geographer (u), was situated at the foot of Mount Lebanon; and Tadmor seems to be in the land of Hamathzobah, <a href="/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3</a>. <p>(p) Geograph. l. 5. c. 16.

The R.V. adopts the reading of the text, probably because of the words ‘in the land.’ All the places mentioned here lie in Palestine, and we know from Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm" title="And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.">Ezekiel 47:19</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/48-28.htm" title="And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.">Ezekiel 48:28</a>) that there was a city Tamar on the south border of the Holy Land, which was towards the wilderness. It seems therefore most likely, as this place is spoken of as ‘in the land,’ that Tamar should be here preferred, and the position assigned to it in Ezekiel is that of a place which it would be most important to fortify. The marginal reading Tadmor is no doubt due to the mention of Tadmor among the cities which Solomon built in <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>. But there Tadmor is mentioned in connexion with Hamath-Zobah and the conquest of the northern part of the land. This reading may be correct in Chronicles, for with Solomon’s ambition to extend his dominion and foster commerce, Tadmor in the wilderness (afterwards so famous as Palmyra) would be a place much to be coveted as a step on the road to Babylon. Tadmor grew famous, and Tamar was well-nigh forgotten, hence we can see how the former name (not mentioned anywhere but in Chronicles) should be substituted on the margin in the verse before us. It may well be that Solomon occupied both places, but there is no warrant for importing the name Tadmor into Kings, especially as the place here mentioned is spoken of as being ‘in the land.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Josephus is very minute in his account of this city, which he (as was to be expected) says was Tadmor (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. viii. 6, i), ‘Having invaded the desert that lies above Syria, and acquired it, he founded there a very great city, two days’ journey from upper Syria, and one from the Euphrates, and its distance from the great city of Babylon was six days. And the reason why he built this city so distant from the inhabited parts of Syria was that nowhere in the land lower down was there water, but that there alone were found fountains and wells. So having built the city and surrounded it with very strong walls, he named it Thadamora, and it is still so called by the Syrians, but the Greeks name it Palmyra.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Baalath</span> [probably the place mentioned in <a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>, and therefore a town of Daniel By some it has been identified, but on wholly insufficient grounds - the mention of Tadmor immediately afterwards being the chief - with Baalbek. This is one of the names which prove how ancient and widespread was the worship of Baal (Gesen., Thesaurus, 225; Dict. Bib., 1:147,148) ] <span class="cmt_word">and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land.</span> [Whether this is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the famous Palmyra, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Tamar, an obscure town of south Judah, is a question which has been much disputed. It should be stated in the first place that the <span class="accented">Cethib</span> has <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>, but the <span class="accented">Keri</span>, after <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>, reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>, as do all the versions; and secondly that a <span class="accented">Tarnar</span> is  mentioned <a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a> and Ezekiel 48:28 a place which may well be identical with "Hazazon Tamar, which is Engedi" (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>. In favour of (1) are the following considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the statement of the chronicler that Solomon did build Palmyra (for of the identity of "Tadmor" with Palmyra there can be no reasonable doubt; see Dict. Bib. 3:1428). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The probability that Solomon, with his wide views of commerce, would seize upon and fortify the one oasis in the great Syrian desert in order to establish an <span class="accented">entrepot</span> there (see on ver. 19). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words "in the wilderness," which, of course, are eminently true of Palmyra. Against it, however, may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Tamar was much more likely to be changed into Tadmor than Tadmor into Tamar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That this place is distinctly described as "in the land," which, <span class="accented">strictly</span>, Palmyra was not. But here it is to be observed that the chronicler omits these words, and that the Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate render, "in the land of the wilderness." Keil says our text is manifestly corrupt, and certainly the expression is a singular one. Some would, therefore, alter <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5e5;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span>, or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span> (after <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>). Both of the emendations, however, while undoubtedly plausible, are purely conjectural. Wordsworth, who thinks Palmyra is meant, says it is described as "in the land" to indicate that God had fulfilled his promise to extend <span class="accented">the land</span> of Solomon far eastward into the <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>). And a Jewish historian, especially in the time of his country s decadence, might well recount how this great city had once been comprised within the boundaries of Israel. In favour of (2) are these facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it is the reading of the text. It is said, however, that the ancient name of Tadmor was Tamar, and the place clearly owed its name to the <span class="accented">Palm</span> trees. But the name is always <span class="accented">Tadmor</span> in the Palmyrene inscriptions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That this place was "in the wilderness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Judah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That it was "in the land," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it was in close proximity to the places just mentioned. The evidence is thus so evenly balanced that it is impossible to decide positively between the two. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Means by which the Buildings were Erected. - In order that all which still remained to be said concerning Solomon's buildings might be grouped together, different notices are introduced here, namely, as to his relation to Hiram, the erection of several fortresses, and the tributary labour, and also as to his maritime expeditions; and these heterogeneous materials are so arranged as to indicate the resources which enabled Solomon to erect so many and such magnificent buildings. These resources were: (1) his connection with king Hiram, who furnished him with building materials (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-14</a>); (2) the tributary labour which he raised in his kingdom (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-25</a>); (3) the maritime expedition to Ophir, which brought him great wealth (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>). But these notices are very condensed, and, as a comparison with the parallel account in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a> shows, are simply incomplete extracts from a more elaborate history. In the account of the tributary labour, the enumeration of the cities finished and fortified (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>) is interpolated; and the information concerning the support which was rendered to Solomon in the erection of his buildings by Hiram (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14</a>), is merely supplementary to the account already given in <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a> point still more clearly to an earlier account, since they would be otherwise unintelligible. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a> the arrangement is a simpler one: the buildings are first of all enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-1.htm">2 Chronicles 8:1-6</a>, and the account of the tributary labour follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7-11</a>.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-14</a><p>The notices concerning Solomon's connection with Hiram are very imperfect; for <a href="/1_kings/9-14.htm">1 Kings 9:14</a> does not furnish a conclusion either in form or substance.

Hiram had supported Solomon according to his desire with cedar wood and cypress wood, and with gold; and Solomon gave him in return, after his buildings were completed, twenty cities in the land of Galil. But these cities did not please Hiram. When he went out to see them, he said, "What kind of cities are these (&#1502;&#1492; in a contemptuous sense) which thou hast given me, my brother?" &#1488;&#1495;&#1493; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-32.htm">1 Kings 20:32</a>, 1 Macc. 10:18; 11:30, 2 Macc. 11:22, as a conventional expression used by princes in their intercourse with one another. "And he called the land Cabul unto this day;" i.e., it retained this name even to later times. The land of Galil is a part of the country which was afterwards known as Galilaea, namely, the northern portion of it, as is evident from the fact that in <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>, Kedes in the mountains of Naphtali, to the north-west of Lake Huleh, is distinguished from the kadesh in southern Palestine by the epithet &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;. It is still more evident from <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> and Galil embraced the northern part of the tribe of Naphtali; whilst the expression used by Isaiah, &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, also shows that this district was for the most part inhabited by heathen (i.e., non-Israelites). The twenty cities in Galil, which Solomon gave to Hiram, certainly belonged therefore to the cities of the Canaanites mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a>; that is to say, they were cities occupied chiefly by a heathen population, and in all probability they were in a very bad condition. Consequently they did not please Hiram, and he gave to the district the contemptuous name of the land of Cabul. Of the various interpretations given to the word Cabul (see Ges. Thes. p. 656), the one proposed by Hiller (Onomast. p. 435), and adopted by Reland, Ges., Maurer, and others, viz., that it is a contraction of &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, sicut id quod evanuit tanquam nihil, has the most to support it, since this is the meaning required by the context. At the same time it is possible, and even probable, that it had originally a different signification, and is derived from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; in the sense of to pawn, as Gesenius and Dietrich suppose. This is favoured by the occurrence of the name Cabul in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>, where it is probably derivable from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, to fetter, and signifies literally a fortress or castle; but in this instance it has no connection with the land of Cabul, since it is still preserved in the village of Cabul to the south-east of Acre (see the Comm. on Josh. l.c.). The "land of Cabul" would therefore mean the pawned land; and in the mouths of the people this would be twisted into "good for nothing." In this case &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; would have to be taken impersonally: "they called;" and the notice respecting this name would be simply an explanation of the way in which the people interpreted it. Hiram, however, did not retain this district, but gave it back to Solomon, who then completed the cities (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>).<p>(Note: This simple method of reconciling the account before us with the apparently discrepant notice in the Chronicles, concerning which even Movers (die biblische Chronik, p. 159) observes, that the chronicler interpolated it from a second (?) source, is so natural, that it is difficult to conceive how Bertheau can object to it; since he admits that the accounts in the books of Kings and Chronicles are incomplete extracts from common and more elaborate sources.)<p>The only way in which we can give to <a href="/1_kings/9-14.htm">1 Kings 9:14</a> a meaning in harmony with the context, is by taking it as a supplementary explanation of &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;...&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;...&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>, and so rendering &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; as a pluperfect, as in <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a> : "Hiram had sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold." If we reckon the value of gold as being ten times the worth of silver, a hundred and twenty talents of gold would be 3,141, 600 thalers (about 471,240: Tr.). This is no doubt to be regarded as a loan, which Solomon obtained from Hiram to enable him to complete his buildings. Although David may have collected together the requisite amount of precious metals for the building of the temple, and Solomon had also very considerable yearly revenues, derived partly from tribute paid by subjugated nations and partly from trade, his buildings were so extensive, inasmuch as he erected a large number of cities beside the temple and his splendid palace (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>), that his revenues might not suffice for the completion of these costly works; and therefore, since he would not apply the consecrated treasures of the temple to the erection of cities and palaces, he might find himself compelled to procure a loan from the wealthy king Hiram, which he probably intended to cover by ceding to him twenty cities on the border of the Phoenician territory. But as these cities did not please the king of Tyre and he gave them back to Solomon, the latter will no doubt have repaid the amount borrowed during the last twenty years of his reign.</body></html>
