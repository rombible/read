This threat follows the Pentateuch exactly in the words in which it is expressed; <a href="/1_kings/9-7.htm">1 Kings 9:7</a> being founded upon <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>, and the curse pronounced upon Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23-26</a> being transferred to the temple in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm">1 Kings 9:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-9.htm">1 Kings 9:9</a>. -  &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, to dismiss, i.e., to reject from before my face. "This house will be &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;," i.e., will stand high, or through its rejection will be a lofty example for all that pass by. The temple stood upon a high mountain, so that its ruins could not fail to attract the attention of all who went past. The expression &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is selected with an implied allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>. God there promises to make Israel &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, high, exalted above all nations. This blessing will be turned into a curse. The temple, which was high and widely renowned, shall continue to be high, but in the opposite sense, as an example of the rejection of Israel from the presence of God.<p>(Note: The conjecture of Bttcher, Thenius, and Bertheau, that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; should be altered into &#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, has no support in <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>, and has all the ancient versions against it; for they all contain the Masoretic text, either in a verbal translation (lxx), or in a paraphrase, as for example the Chaldee, "the house that was high shall be destroyed;" the Syriac and Arabic, "this house will be destroyed;" and the Vulgate, domus haec erit in exemplum. - In <a href="/2_chronicles/7-21.htm">2 Chronicles 7:21</a> the thought is somewhat varied by the alteration of &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; into &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. For it would never enter the mind of any sober critic to attribute this variation to a misinterpretation of our text. Still less can it be an unsuccessful attempt to explain or rectify our text, as Bttcher imagines, since the assertion of this critic, that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; is only used to signify an exalted position, and never the exaltation of dignity or worth, is proved to be erroneous by <a href="/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>.) </body></html>
