He began at the right end, for he built God's house first, and finished that before he began his own; then God blessed him, and he prospered in all his other buildings. Let piety begin, and profit follow; leave pleasure to the last. Whatever pains we take for the glory of God, and to profit others, we are likely to have the advantage. Canaan, the holy land, the glory of all lands, had no gold in it; which shows that the best produce is that which is for the present support of life, our own and others; such things did Canaan produce. Solomon got much by his merchandise, and yet has directed us to a better trade, within reach of the poorest.

Or, thirdly, There was but two hundred and fifty at one time, which is noted there, and two hundred and fifty at another time, (for it is apparent they did their work by turns,) and the other fifty either were superior to all the rest, or rather were a reserve to supply the place of any of the five hundred when there was occasion, which might frequently happen. And so this was an act not unbecoming Solomon’s wisdom, to make provision for emergencies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These were the chief of the officers over Solomon's work,....

Abarbinel reconciles the places thus, the two hundred and fifty were only over those that wrought in the temple; and the five hundred and fifty here were those that were over such that were employed in the various parts of the kingdom. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These <i>were</i> the chief of the officers that <i>were</i> over Solomon's work, <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.</span><p>(i) The overseers of Solomon's works were divided into three parts: the first contained 3300, the second 300, and the third 250 who were Israelites.

In <a href="/2_chronicles/8-11.htm" title="And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD has come.">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>, two hundred and fifty is given as the number of these officials. Kennicott explains this variation by the reading of one letter for another in the Hebrew system of indicating numbers by the letters of the alphabet.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These were the chief of the Officers that were over Solomon's work; five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work</span> [see on 1 Kings 5:16]. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This city Solomon built: i.e., he not only rebuilt it, but also fortified it. He did the same also to Lower Bethhoron, i.e., Beit-Ur Tachta, on the western slope of the mountains, four hours' journey from Gibeon. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5</a>, Solomon also fortified Upper Bethhoron, which was separated by a deep wady from Lower Bethhoron, that lay to the west (see Comm. on <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a> and <a href="/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>). The two Bethhorons and Gezer were very important places for the protection of the mountainous country of Benjamin, Ephraim, and Judah against hostile invasions from the Philistian plain. The situation of Megiddo on the southern edge of the plain of Jezreel, through which the high road from the western coast to the Jordan ran, was equally important; and so also was Hazor as a border fortress against Syria in the northern part of the land.</body></html>
