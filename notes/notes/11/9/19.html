These places would be provided so that surplus produce which could be preserved, as corn, oil, wine, &c. might be stored in times of plenty to be ready when need should require. We read that Hezekiah made some similar provision (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-28.htm" title="Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen</span>] Special places must have been needed for these, when we consider the great number of them (see below <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm" title="And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.">1 Kings 10:26</a>).

The injunction of <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> against the multiplication of horses by the king was apparently forgotten or disregarded.

V. ‘the desire of Solomon which he desired to build’ is better brought out in the text of R.V. ‘that which Solomon desired to build <span class="bld">for his pleasure</span>.’ The noun is the same as in <a href="/1_kings/9-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,">1 Kings 9:1</a> of this chapter, and the writer here is evidently distinguishing these later-named works from the former. The first in the list were either fortifications, or strongholds, or store-cities, but the others are for the king’s own pleasure and enjoyment. (Cf. on the whole subject, <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm" title="I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards:...">Ecclesiastes 2:4-8</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and in Lebanon</span>] The place of all others to which for relaxation the king would retire. The scorching heat of the lower plains could there be escaped, while the fragrance of the vegetation made a residence there most enjoyable. The writer of Solomon’s Song paints for us the loveliness of the spot, ‘a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters and streams from Lebanon’ (<a href="/1_kings/4-15.htm" title="Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:">1 Kings 4:15</a>), and again, ‘his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars’ (<a href="/1_kings/5-15.htm" title="And Solomon had three score and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;">1 Kings 5:15</a>), and ‘the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon’ (<a href="/1_kings/4-11.htm" title="The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:">1 Kings 4:11</a>).

The fact that these store cities are mentioned in the same breath with Tadmor, is an argument for the identification of that place with Palmyra, which Solomon could only have built as a means of gaining or retaining control over the caravan trade between the East and the Mediterranean. Cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, and <a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48</a>.

See Stanley, pp. 197-199); and we may reasonably imagine (with Ewald) that in these latter he sought to grow specimens of the plants, etc., about which he "spoke" (ch. 4:33; cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>). "It is a curious fact that in the ground hard by the 'fountains of Solomon' near Bethlehem, which exhibit manifest traces of an ancient garden, and where the intimations of Josephus would lead us to suppose that Solomon had a rural retreat, are still to be found a number of plants self sown from age to age, which do not exist in any other part of the Holy Land" (Kitto, "Bib. Illus." vol. 4. p. 101). Some of Solomon's journeys to these favourite resorts, we can hardly doubt, are referred to in <a href="/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6-10</a>; <a href="/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a> sqq.; Song of Solomon 6:11] <span class="cmt_word">and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Means by which the Buildings were Erected. - In order that all which still remained to be said concerning Solomon's buildings might be grouped together, different notices are introduced here, namely, as to his relation to Hiram, the erection of several fortresses, and the tributary labour, and also as to his maritime expeditions; and these heterogeneous materials are so arranged as to indicate the resources which enabled Solomon to erect so many and such magnificent buildings. These resources were: (1) his connection with king Hiram, who furnished him with building materials (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-14</a>); (2) the tributary labour which he raised in his kingdom (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-25</a>); (3) the maritime expedition to Ophir, which brought him great wealth (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>). But these notices are very condensed, and, as a comparison with the parallel account in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a> shows, are simply incomplete extracts from a more elaborate history. In the account of the tributary labour, the enumeration of the cities finished and fortified (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>) is interpolated; and the information concerning the support which was rendered to Solomon in the erection of his buildings by Hiram (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14</a>), is merely supplementary to the account already given in <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a> point still more clearly to an earlier account, since they would be otherwise unintelligible. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a> the arrangement is a simpler one: the buildings are first of all enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-1.htm">2 Chronicles 8:1-6</a>, and the account of the tributary labour follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7-11</a>.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-14</a><p>The notices concerning Solomon's connection with Hiram are very imperfect; for <a href="/1_kings/9-14.htm">1 Kings 9:14</a> does not furnish a conclusion either in form or substance.

Hiram had supported Solomon according to his desire with cedar wood and cypress wood, and with gold; and Solomon gave him in return, after his buildings were completed, twenty cities in the land of Galil. But these cities did not please Hiram. When he went out to see them, he said, "What kind of cities are these (&#1502;&#1492; in a contemptuous sense) which thou hast given me, my brother?" &#1488;&#1495;&#1493; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-32.htm">1 Kings 20:32</a>, 1 Macc. 10:18; 11:30, 2 Macc. 11:22, as a conventional expression used by princes in their intercourse with one another. "And he called the land Cabul unto this day;" i.e., it retained this name even to later times. The land of Galil is a part of the country which was afterwards known as Galilaea, namely, the northern portion of it, as is evident from the fact that in <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>, Kedes in the mountains of Naphtali, to the north-west of Lake Huleh, is distinguished from the kadesh in southern Palestine by the epithet &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;. It is still more evident from <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> and Galil embraced the northern part of the tribe of Naphtali; whilst the expression used by Isaiah, &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;, also shows that this district was for the most part inhabited by heathen (i.e., non-Israelites). The twenty cities in Galil, which Solomon gave to Hiram, certainly belonged therefore to the cities of the Canaanites mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a>; that is to say, they were cities occupied chiefly by a heathen population, and in all probability they were in a very bad condition. Consequently they did not please Hiram, and he gave to the district the contemptuous name of the land of Cabul. Of the various interpretations given to the word Cabul (see Ges. Thes. p. 656), the one proposed by Hiller (Onomast. p. 435), and adopted by Reland, Ges., Maurer, and others, viz., that it is a contraction of &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, sicut id quod evanuit tanquam nihil, has the most to support it, since this is the meaning required by the context. At the same time it is possible, and even probable, that it had originally a different signification, and is derived from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; in the sense of to pawn, as Gesenius and Dietrich suppose. This is favoured by the occurrence of the name Cabul in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>, where it is probably derivable from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;, to fetter, and signifies literally a fortress or castle; but in this instance it has no connection with the land of Cabul, since it is still preserved in the village of Cabul to the south-east of Acre (see the Comm. on Josh. l.c.). The "land of Cabul" would therefore mean the pawned land; and in the mouths of the people this would be twisted into "good for nothing." In this case &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; would have to be taken impersonally: "they called;" and the notice respecting this name would be simply an explanation of the way in which the people interpreted it. Hiram, however, did not retain this district, but gave it back to Solomon, who then completed the cities (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>).<p>(Note: This simple method of reconciling the account before us with the apparently discrepant notice in the Chronicles, concerning which even Movers (die biblische Chronik, p. 159) observes, that the chronicler interpolated it from a second (?) source, is so natural, that it is difficult to conceive how Bertheau can object to it; since he admits that the accounts in the books of Kings and Chronicles are incomplete extracts from common and more elaborate sources.)<p>The only way in which we can give to <a href="/1_kings/9-14.htm">1 Kings 9:14</a> a meaning in harmony with the context, is by taking it as a supplementary explanation of &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489;...&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;...&#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>, and so rendering &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; as a pluperfect, as in <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a> : "Hiram had sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold." If we reckon the value of gold as being ten times the worth of silver, a hundred and twenty talents of gold would be 3,141, 600 thalers (about 471,240: Tr.). This is no doubt to be regarded as a loan, which Solomon obtained from Hiram to enable him to complete his buildings. Although David may have collected together the requisite amount of precious metals for the building of the temple, and Solomon had also very considerable yearly revenues, derived partly from tribute paid by subjugated nations and partly from trade, his buildings were so extensive, inasmuch as he erected a large number of cities beside the temple and his splendid palace (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15-19</a>), that his revenues might not suffice for the completion of these costly works; and therefore, since he would not apply the consecrated treasures of the temple to the erection of cities and palaces, he might find himself compelled to procure a loan from the wealthy king Hiram, which he probably intended to cover by ceding to him twenty cities on the border of the Phoenician territory. But as these cities did not please the king of Tyre and he gave them back to Solomon, the latter will no doubt have repaid the amount borrowed during the last twenty years of his reign.</body></html>
