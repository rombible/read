But <span class="ital">if you shall at all turn from following me</span>] The insertion of ‘at all’ here is an attempt to give some force to the Hebrew construction. It is a peculiarity of that language to use the infinitive of a verb followed by a finite tense to give emphasis to an expression. But undoubtedly ‘at all’ weakens the sense here.

"The district of Hamath," i.e., Epiphania on the Orontes, is mentioned as the northern boundary (cf. <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>, etc.); and "the brook of Egypt" (&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;), Rhinocorura, as the southern boundary (cf. <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4</a>). "The feast" (&#1492;&#1495;&#1490;), which Solomon held with the people "seven days and seven days, fourteen days," is not the feast of the dedication, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>, the feast of tabernacles, which fell in the seventh month; and the meaning of the verse is, that on that occasion the feast of the seventh month was kept for fourteen days, namely, seven days as the feast of the dedication, and seven days as the feast of tabernacles. We are obliged to take the words in this way, partly on account of the evident reference to &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1490; (at the feast) in <a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a> in the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1490; (the feast) in this verse, and partly on account of the statement which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>, "and on the eighth day he sent the people away." The "eight day" is not the first day of the feast of tabernacles (Thenius); but the eighth day, as the conclusion of the feast of tabernacles, &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). The correctness of this view is placed beyond all doubt by the context in the Chronicles, which states more clearly that, "Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him ... and they kept &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514; (the closing feast) on the eight day; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days; and on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away." The feast of tabernacles lasted seven days, from the 15th to the 21st, with a closing festival on the eighth day, i.e., the 22nd of the month (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-39</a>). This festival was preceded by the dedication of the temple from the 8th to the 14th of the month. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-66.htm">1 Kings 8:66</a>, "on the eighth day he sent the people away," if we take the words in their strict sense, is at variance with the statement in the Chronicles, "on the 23rd day," since the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles was the 22nd day of the month; but it may easily be accounted for from want of precision in a well-known matter. Solomon sent the people away on the eighth day, i.e., on the afternoon or evening of the atzereth of the feast of tabernacles, so that on the morning of the next day, i.e., on the 23rd of the month, the people took their journey home, "joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had shown to His servant David and to the people." David is mentioned, because the completion of the building of the temple was the fulfilment of the divine promise given to him. "Tents," for houses, as in <a href="/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-8.htm">Judges 7:8</a>, and other passages. </body></html>
