Possibly the seeds of disaffection may have still lurked in Tirzah, the place of Zimri’s conspiracy, and (as has been conjectured) of Tibni’s rival power. But the site of Samaria must have been chosen by a soldier’s eye. Its Hebrew name (<span class= "ital">Shomerôn</span>) means a “watch-tower,” and may well have had a double derivation, from its natural position, as well as from its owner’s name. Its position was one of great beauty, and, in the warfare of those days, of singular strength, as is shown by the long sieges which it withstood (<a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm" title="And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.">1Kings 20:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.">2Kings 6:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm" title="Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.">2Kings 17:5</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/18-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.">2Kings 18:9-10</a>). It lay north-west of Shechem, on an isolated hill with precipitous sides, rising in the middle of a basin of the hills of Ephraim, not far from the edge of the maritime plain, and commanding a view of the sea. Its history vindicated the sagacity of its founder. Even after its destruction and depopulation by the Assyrians, it seems to have revived, for Alexander took it on his invasion of Palestine, and placed a Greek colony there. Again destroyed by John Hyrcanus, it was rebuilt by Herod, and called <span class= "ital">Sebaste</span>, in honour of Augustus. In the Assyrian inscriptions it is known as Beth-Khumri (“the house of Omri”).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm" title="And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.">1 Kings 16:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer </span>— Where he built the noted city of that name, which ever after was the royal city of the kings of Israel, the palace of Tirzah being burned.

Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Samaria" represents the Greek form of the name &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  Samareia; the original is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;  sho&#770;mero&#770;n (margin). The site is marked by the modern "Sebustiyeh," an Arabic corruption of Sebaste, the name given by Herod to Samaria when he rebuilt it. Sebustiyeh is situated on a very remarkable "hill." In the heart of the mountains of Israel occurs a deep basin-shaped depression, in the midst of which rises an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. This was the site which Omri chose for his new capital. Politically it was rather more central than Shechem, and probably than Tirzah. In a military point of view it was admirably calculated for defense. The country round it was especially productive. The hill itself possessed abundant springs of water. The result is that we find no further change. Shechem and Tirzah were each tried and abandoned; but through all the later alterations of dynasty Samaria continued uninterruptedly, to the very close of the independence, to be the capital of the northern kingdom.<p>Omri purchased the right of property in the hill, just as David purchased the threshing-floor (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>; compare <a href="/1_kings/21-2.htm">1 Kings 21:2</a>). Two talents, or 6,000 shekels (<a href="/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a> note) - about 500 British pounds (or perhaps 800 pounds) of our money - may well have been the full value of the ground. And while naming his city after Shemer, Omri may also have had in view the appropriateness of such a name to the situation of the place. Shomeron, to a Hebrew ear, would have necessarily conveyed the idea of a "watch-tower." This name, however, appears not to have been at first accepted by the surrounding nations. The earlier Assyrian kings knew the Israelite capital, not as Samaria, but as Beth-Khumri, i. e., "the city (house) of Omri." It is not until the time of Tiglath-pileser that they exchange this designation for that of "Sammirin." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer&#8212;The palace of Tirzah being in ruins, Omri, in selecting the site of his royal residence, was naturally influenced by considerations both of pleasure and advantage. In the center of a wide amphitheatre of mountains, about six miles from Shechem, rises an oblong hill with steep, yet accessible sides, and a long flat top extending east and west, and rising five hundred or six hundred feet above the valley. What Omri in all probability built as a mere palatial residence, became the capital of the kingdom instead of Shechem. It was as though Versailles had taken the place of Paris, or Windsor of London. The choice of Omri was admirable, in selecting a position which combined in a union not elsewhere found in Palestine: strength, beauty, and fertility [Stanley].<p>two talents of silver&#8212;&pound;684. Shemer had probably made it a condition of the sale, that the name should be retained. But as city and palace were built there by Omri, it was in accordance with Eastern custom to call it after the founder. The Assyrians did so, and on a tablet dug out of the ruins of Nineveh, an inscription was found relating to Samaria, which is called Beth-khumri&#8212;the house of Omri [Layard].

(See note there.)

During the four years of anarchy Omri would seem to have retained possession of the capital which he had taken (ver. 18) on Zimri's death. But the palace being burnt and the defences perhaps weakened by the siege, he determined, rather than rebuild it, to found a capital elsewhere] <span class="cmt_word">the hill Samaria</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Shomeron</span>, called by Herod <span class="accented">Sebaste</span>, whence its modern name <span class="accented">Sebustieh</span>. In his selection of Samaria for the seat of government, Omri acted with singular judgment. It has been said that "Shechem is the natural capital of Palestine," and no doubt it enjoys a commanding position and great advantages, but Samaria has even superior recommendations. It is a site with which no traveller can fail to be deeply impressed. Even Van de Velde, who says, "I do not agree with Dr. Robinson and other writers who follow him that the mountain of Samaria presents so admirable a combination of strength, fertility, and beauty, that the like is hardly to be found in Palestine" (vol. 1. pp. 374, 375), nevertheless readily allows its superiority to Tirzah, and remarks on the strength of its position. "Many travellers have expressed a conviction that the spot was in most respects much preferable to the site of Jerusalem" (Kitto). It is a large oval or oblong mound, with a level surface, adapted for buildings, with steep sides to make its position  impregnable, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills. "Samaria is in a position of great strength., and must before the invention of gunpowder have been almost impregnable. It stands some 400 feet above the valley, the sides of the hill being steep and terraced in every direction for cultivation, or perhaps for defensive purposes.. broad and open valleys stretch north and south, and the hill is thus almost isolated," Conder, p. 47, who adds, "Strategical reasons may be supposed to have dictated the choice of the capital of Omri, for on the north the hill commands the main road to Jezreel over a steep pass, on the west it dominates the road to the coast, and on the east that to the Jordan" (p. 49). Grove (Dict. Bib. 3:1099) speaks of "the singular beauty of the spot," and Stanley ("Jewish Church" it. p. 284) justly sees in the selection of this spot a proof of Omri's sagacity. But perhaps the best proof is that which the subsequent history supplies. Shechem and Tirzah had each been tried, and each in turn had been abandoned. But Samaria continued to be the capital so long as the kingdom lasted] <span class="cmt_word">of Shemer for two talents of silver</span> [variously estimated at &pound;500 and &pound;800. This purchase, obviously of the freehold, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in perpetuity, was in contravention of the law of <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>. David had bought the threshing floor of Ornan, but that was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from a Jebusite, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> for a high religious purpose (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been suggested that this purchase may have inspired Ahab with the idea of buying the vineyard of Naboth], and built on [Heb. <span class="accented">built</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the hill and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.</span> [It is not improbable that the vendor bargained that the land should retain his name (cf. <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>). The reluctance of the Israelite to part with his patrimony, even to the king, is brought out very strikingly in ch. 21. Shemer, in selling his choice parcel of land for a capital, might well wish to connect his name with it. The fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> means <span class="accented">watch mountain</span> (Gesen.), and that we should have expected a name formed from Shemer to take the form <span class="accented">Shimron - Shomeron</span> would strictly imply an original <span class="accented">Shomer</span> - is not by any means a proof that our historian is at fault in his derivation. For, in the first place, the names Shomer and Shemer are used of the same person in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32, 34</a>. And secondly, nothing would be more in accordance with Jewish ideas than that Omri, in naming the hill after its owner, should give a turn to the word which would also express at the same time its characteristic feature. A pun, or play upon word, was the form which wit assumed amongst the Semitic races (as, indeed, is the case still, see Conder, p. 801), and the form <span class="accented">Shomeron</span> would at once perpetuate the memory of Shemer, and express the hope and purpose of Omri. It is a curious fact that the later Samaritans did play upon this very word, representing themselves as <span class="accented">guardians</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) of the law (Ewald). The Greek form of the name, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, would seem to have been derived through the Chaldee <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> as found in <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10, 17</a>.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Reign of Zimri lasted only seven days.
