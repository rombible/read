God calls Israel his people still, though wretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come upon Baasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expect to resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baasha himself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainly appears that there are punishments after death, which are most to be dreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death may surprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besides the diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in that state, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to bad accidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding them in the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comes upon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Their idols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help; miserable are those whose gods are vanities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The natural position of this verse would be after <a href="/1_kings/16-4.htm">1 Kings 16:4</a> and before <a href="/1_kings/16-5.htm">1 Kings 16:5</a>. But it may be regarded as added by the writer, somewhat irregularly, as an afterthought; its special force being to point out that the sentence on Baasha was intended to punish, not only his calf-worship, but emphatically his murder of Jeroboam and his family. Though the destruction of Jeroboam had been foretold, and though Baasha may be rightly regarded as God's instrument to punish Jeroboam's sins, yet, as he received no command to execute God's wrath on the offender, and was instigated solely by ambition and self-interest, his guilt was just as great as if no prophecy had been uttered. Even Jehu's commission <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-5.htm">2 Kings 9:5-10</a> was not held to justify, altogether, his murder of Jehoram and Jezebel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. also by the hand of the prophet Jehu&#8212;This is not another prophecy, but merely an addition by the sacred historian, explanatory of the death of Baasha and the extinction of his family. The doom pronounced against Jeroboam (1Ki 14:9), did not entitle him to take the execution of the sentence into his own hands; but from his following the same calf-worship, he had evidently plotted the conspiracy and murder of that king in furtherance of his own ambitious designs; and hence, in his own assassination, he met the just reward of his deeds. The similitude to Jeroboam extends to their deaths as well as their lives&#8212;the reign of their sons, and the ruin of their families.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the hand of the prophet Jehu came the word of the Lord:</span> the meaning is, the message which <span class="ital">came from the Lord to Jehu</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,">1 Kings 16:1</a></span>, &c., was here delivered <span class="ital">by the hand</span>, i.e. the ministry, of <span class="ital">Jehu</span>, unto Baasha.

God had raised up Baasha, and sent him against Jeroboam, but it is clear from this verse that the manner in which punishment had been inflicted by Baasha was not such as God approved of. We may compare with this the language of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm" title="I was wroth with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and given them into your hand: you did show them no mercy; on the ancient have you very heavily laid your yoke.">Isaiah 47:6</a>) where God by the mouth of His prophet declares His wrath against His people, and how He delivered them into the hand of the king of Babylon, but at the same time shews His anger with the conqueror for the way in which he had exercised cruelty; “Thou didst shew them no mercy.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The R.V. has rendered the verb ‘smote’ because it is so rendered in <a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm" title="And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.">1 Kings 15:27</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:">1 Kings 15:29</a>, about the destruction of Jeroboam and of his house.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, came the word of the Lord against Baasha</span> [This does not refer, as some have thought, to a second prophecy on Jehu's part, but is rather explicative of ver. 2. Rawlinson thinks the object of the historian herein was to point out that Baasha was punished for the "murder of Jeroboam [?] and his family," as well as for the calf worship. Keil and Bahr hold that it is designed to guard against a perversion of ver. 2, "I made thee prince," etc., from which it might be inferred that he was commissioned of God to murder Nadab. But it is simpler to suppose that his primary idea was to convey, by this repetition, which no doubt is derived from a different source from the statement of ver. 2, that Baasha was visited <span class="accented">by God</span> for his various sins. It was no chance that happened to him.

With regard to this last reason, we must call to mind the remark made at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-39.htm">1 Kings 11:39</a>, viz., that the prediction of the prophet to Baasha gave him no right to put himself forward arbitrarily as the fulfiller of the prophecy. The very fact that Baasha continued Jeroboam's sin and caused the illegal worship to be perpetuated, showed clearly enough that in exterminating the family of Jeroboam he did not act under divine direction, but simply pursued his own selfish ends. </body></html>
