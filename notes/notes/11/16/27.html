Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His might - Perhaps in the war between Israel and Syria of Damascus (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>, etc.), during the reign of Omri.

He may well have had other wars, which, like this, have escaped notice in Scripture. If the king of Syria spoke truly (<a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>), the war with that power had been extremely disastrous. Yet the Assyrian inscriptions prove that Omri's name was more widely and permanently known in the East than those of his predecessors or successors. Samaria, for example, down to the time of Tiglath-Pileser, appears as <span class="accented">Beth Khumri</span>, the "house of Omri;" Athaliah,the daughter of Ahab, is called a daughter of Omri; and Jehu appears in the <span class="accented">Black Obelisk Inscription</span> as "the son of Omri" (Rawlinson, "Hist. Illus. of O.T.," pp. 111-12).

The nation divided itself into two halves; one half was behind Tibni, the son of Ginath (i.e., declared in favour of Tibni), to make him king, the other adhered to Omri. Nevertheless Omri's gained the upper hand over the party of Tibni, and the latter died, whereupon Omri became king after four years, as we may see from a comparison of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-15.htm">1 Kings 16:15</a>, <a href="/1_kings/16-16.htm">1 Kings 16:16</a> with <a href="/1_kings/16-23.htm">1 Kings 16:23</a>. The "people of Israel" (<a href="/1_kings/16-21.htm">1 Kings 16:21</a>) are probably the fighting people, so that the succession to the throne was decided by the military. &#1488;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; as in <a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>. &#1492;&#1494;&#1511;, with an accusative instead of with &#1506;&#1500;, in the sense of to overpower, as in <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>. According to Josephus (Ant. viii. 12, 5), Tibni was slain by his opponent; but this is not contained in the words; on the contrary, all that is implied in the connection of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;/ is that he met with his death in the decisive engagement in which the opposing party triumphed. </body></html>
