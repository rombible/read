The word here rendered “palace” evidently means (as is clear from its derivation) “the high place,” or “citadel,” of the building. Some render it the “harem,” with which the curious rendering (<span class= "greekheb">ἄντρον</span>) of the LXX.—signifying properly a cave or “lurking-place”—may perhaps, agree. But this is not suggested by the word itself. This desperate act of Zimri, which has many parallels in Eastern history, seems to indicate that there was held to be something especially treasonable, and therefore unpardonable, in his assassination of Elah. (See <a href="/1_kings/16-20.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he worked, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">1Kings 16:20</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/9-31.htm" title="And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?">2Kings 9:31</a>.)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/16-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.">1 Kings 16:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Zimri saw that the city was taken — </span>Tirzah, though a beautiful city, it seems, was not fortified; so that Omri soon made himself master of it, and forced Zimri into the palace; which, as he was unable to defend, and yet unwilling to surrender it, he burned, and himself in it: grudging that his rival should ever enjoy so sumptuous a palace, and fearing that if he fell into the hands of his enemies, either alive or dead, he should be ignominiously treated.

Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The palace of the king's house - The tower of the king's house.

Zimri soon saw that he was not in circumstances to hold out against all the forces of the kingdom; so, shutting himself up in the palace, he set it on fire, and, like Sardanapalus, chose to perish himself and reduce all to ruin, rather than that the palace and royal treasures should fall into the hands of his successful rival. The seven days' reign may refer either to the brief duration of his royal authority, or the period in which he enjoyed unmolested tranquillity in the palace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Burnt the king’s house over him; </span> or, <span class="ital">and he burnt</span>, &c.

The palace, no doubt, consisted of a string of buildings (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-9</a>) of which this was the highest and strongest part.

But, as Bight remarks there is nothing of this in the text, and Zimri's desperate act rather shows daring and contempt of death than effeminacy or sensuality. And <a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/122-7.htm">Psalm 122:7</a>) seems to point to a stronghold rather than a seraglio] <span class="cmt_word">of the king's house, and burnt the king's house</span> [probably the palace which Jereboam had built.
