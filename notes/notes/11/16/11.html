God calls Israel his people still, though wretchedly corrupted. Jehu foretells the same destruction to come upon Baasha's family, which that king had been employed to bring upon the family of Jeroboam. Those who resemble others in their sins, may expect to resemble them in the plagues they suffer, especially those who seem zealous against such sins in others as they allow in themselves. Baasha himself dies in peace, and is buried with honour. Herein plainly appears that there are punishments after death, which are most to be dreaded. Let Elah be a warning to drunkards, who know not but death may surprise them. Death easily comes upon men when they are drunk. Besides the diseases which men bring themselves into by drinking, when in that state, men are easily overcome by an enemy, and liable to bad accidents. Death comes terribly upon men in such a state, finding them in the act of sin, and unfitted for any act of devotion; that day comes upon them unawares. The word of God was fulfilled, and the sins of Baasha and Elah were reckoned for, with which they provoked God. Their idols are called their vanities, for idols cannot profit nor help; miserable are those whose gods are vanities.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends - Zimri's measures were of much more than ordinary severity. Not only was the royal family extirpated, but the friends of the king, his councillors and favorite officers, were put to death. Omri, as having been in the confidence of the late monarch, would naturally fear for himself, and resolve to take the course which promised him at least a chance of safety. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 16:9-22.

He was not content with extirpating the royal family, but put to death the partizans of the house, all who would be likely to sympathize with Elah or to resent his murder.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a> adds a supplementary remark concerning the words of Jehu (<a href="/1_kings/16-2.htm">1 Kings 16:2</a>.), not to preclude an excuse that might be made, in which case &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; would have to be taken in the sense of nevertheless, or notwithstanding (Ewald, 354, a.), but to guard against a misinterpretation by adding a new feature, or rather to preclude an erroneous inference that might be drawn from the words, "I (Jehovah) have made thee prince" (<a href="/1_kings/16-2.htm">1 Kings 16:2</a>), as through Baasha had exterminated Nadab and his house by divine command (Thenius). &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; simply means "and also," and is not to be connected specially with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, but to be taken as belonging to the whole sentence: "also the word of Jehovah had come to Baasha through Jehu, ... not only because of the evil, etc., but also (&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;...&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;) because he had slain him (Jeroboam)." With regard to this last reason, we must call to mind the remark made at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-39.htm">1 Kings 11:39</a>, viz., that the prediction of the prophet to Baasha gave him no right to put himself forward arbitrarily as the fulfiller of the prophecy. The very fact that Baasha continued Jeroboam's sin and caused the illegal worship to be perpetuated, showed clearly enough that in exterminating the family of Jeroboam he did not act under divine direction, but simply pursued his own selfish ends. </body></html>
