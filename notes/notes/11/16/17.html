Proud aspiring men ruin one another. Omri struggled with Tibni some years. Though we do not always understand the rules by which God governs nations and individuals in his providence, we may learn useful lessons from the history before us. When tyrants succeed each other, and massacres, conspiracies, and civil wars, we may be sure the Lord has a controversy with the people for their sins; they are loudly called to repent and reform. Omri made himself infamous by his wickedness. Many wicked men have been men of might and renown; have built cities, and their names are found in history; but they have no name in the book of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Went up - The expression "went up" marks accurately the ascent of the army from the Shephelah, where Gibbethon was situated <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>, to the hill country of Israel, on the edge of which Tirzah stood <a href="/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-18. did Zimri reign seven days&#8212;The news of his conspiracy soon spread, and the army having proclaimed their general, Omri, king, that officer immediately raised the siege at Gibbethon and marched directly against the capital in which the usurper had established himself. Zimri soon saw that he was not in circumstances to hold out against all the forces of the kingdom; so, shutting himself up in the palace, he set it on fire, and, like Sardanapalus, chose to perish himself and reduce all to ruin, rather than that the palace and royal treasures should fall into the hands of his successful rival. The seven days' reign may refer either to the brief duration of his royal authority, or the period in which he enjoyed unmolested tranquillity in the palace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him,....
