The Book of Proverbs belongs mainly, but not exclusively, to the second class. Its main part consists of two series of “Proverbs of Solomon” (Proverbs 10-24, 25-29), composed or collected by him; falling, however, far short of the number given in this verse. The earlier portion (see especially <a href="/context/1_kings/1-20.htm" title="And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.">1Kings 1:20-33</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-2.htm" title="Why his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.">1Kings 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm" title="But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.">1Kings 1:8</a>) partakes more of the character of the first and fourth classes; and in <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm" title="In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,">Ecclesiastes 12:3-6</a>, and perhaps <a href="/context/proverbs/30-15.htm" title="The horse leach has two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yes, four things say not, It is enough:">Proverbs 30:15-16</a>; <a href="/context/proverbs/30-24.htm" title="There be four things which are little on the earth, but they are exceeding wise:">Proverbs 30:24-31</a>, we have specimens of the third. If the “three thousand” of the text be intended to be taken literally, it is obvious that only a small part of Solomon’s proverbs has been preserved. His declension into idolatry might induce care in selection. by such prophetic compilers as “the men of Hezekiah” (Proverbs 25).<p><span class= "bld">His songs.</span>—We have still ascribed to Solomon the “Song of Songs” and two Psalms (72 and 127); but nothing else is, even by tradition, preserved to us. This passage is singularly interesting as showing that the Old Testament Canon is not a collection of chance fragments of a scanty literature, but that out of a literature, which at this time, at any rate, was large and copious, deliberate selections by prophetic authority were made. (The “men of Hezekiah,” named in <a href="/proverbs/25-1.htm" title="These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.">Proverbs 25:1</a>, are by Jewish tradition Isaiah and his companions.) In the case of Solomon some special caution would be natural, and much of his poetry may have been purely secular. The “Psalter of Solomon” (including eighteen psalms) is a Greek apocryphal book, of the time of the Maccabees or later.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/4-32.htm" title="And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five....">1 Kings 4:32-33</a></span>. <span class="ital">He spake three thousand proverbs </span>— That is, short, deep, and useful sentences, whereof a great part are contained in the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. <span class="ital">Songs — </span>Whereof the most divine and chief are in the Canticles. <span class="ital">And he spake of trees — </span>That is, of all plants, of their nature and qualities. <span class="ital">From the cedar-tree unto the hyssop — </span>From the greatest to the least. <span class="ital">That springeth out of the wall — </span>Dr. Waterland renders the original here, <span class="ital">Hyssop that runneth out to the wall: </span>the wall of Jerusalem may be meant, which was encompassed with mountains that produced abundance of hyssop. <span class="ital">He spake also of beasts and of fowl, </span>&c. — This shows the vastness of his knowledge, which comprehended the history of animals as well as of plants, whose nature and qualities he also understood.

He had what is here called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spread through all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learn of him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Proverbs - In the collection which forms the "Book of Proverbs," only a small portion has been preserved, less certainly than one thousand out of the three.

The LXX. makes the number of the songs to be 5000; Josephus agrees with the Hebrew text. We need not suppose that these songs were of a sacred character. Psalms 72, 127 are (if we be consistent in translating the preposition) ascribed to Solomon in their titles, but the titles are of small authority, and in the latter case the LXX. omits the ascription to Solomon. Ewald thinks the second Psalm may be one of Solomon’s composition. Dean Perowne, thinking it probable that Solomon made a collection of his father’s poetry for the service of the Temple, attributes the first Psalm to him. The sententious and somewhat proverbial character of the language gives support to this opinion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake three thousand proverbs</span>: <span class="cmt_word">and his songs were a thousand and five.</span> [Of the former, less than one-third are preserved in the Book of Proverbs (see <a href="/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>); the rest are lost to us.

Solomon had a strong force of war chariots and cavalry, that he might be able to suppress every attempt on the part of the tributary kings of Syria and Philistia to revolt and disturb the peace. "Solomon had 4000 racks of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 riding horses," which were kept partly in Jerusalem and partly in cities specially built for the purpose (<a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>). &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; (40) is an old copyist's error for &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;   (4), which we find in the parallel passage <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>, and as we may also infer from <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a>, since according to these passages Solomon had 1400 &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; or war chariots. For 4000 horses are a very suitable number for 1400 chariots, though not 40,000, since two draught horses were required for every war chariot, and one horse may have been kept as a reserve. &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492; does not mean a team (Ges.), but a rack or box in a stable, from &#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, carpere.
