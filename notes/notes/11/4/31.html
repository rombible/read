In the genealogy of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm" title="And the sons of Zerah; Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all.">1Chronicles 2:6</a>, “Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Dara” (or “Darda”) are found as sons of Zerah, the son of Judah; and the coincidence is remarkable enough to suggest identification. But this identification can scarcely hold. This passage evidently implies that these rivals of Solomon were contemporary with him, not belonging, therefore, to a family many generations earlier. Now it happens that we know of a Heman and an Ethan (see <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-44.htm" title="And their brothers the sons of Merari stood on the left hand: Ethan the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,">1Chronicles 6:44</a>) set by David over the service of song in the Tabernacle, and called “Ezrahites” in the titles of Psalms 88, 89 ascribed to them. Heman is, moreover, designated as “the king’s seer in the words of the Lord” (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm" title="All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.">1Chronicles 25:5</a>); and his Psalm (Psalms 88) is singularly full of thought, moral speculation, and sense of mystery in life and death. Chalcol and Darda are described as sous of Machol. The word <span class= "ital">Machol </span>may be a proper name. But it is curious that it signifies “dance,” or “music”; and it is at least possible that they also, like Heman and Ethan, may have been thus designated, as connected with the music of the Temple. However this may be, it can hardly be wrong, in spite of the repetition of the group of names, to refer this passage to this Heman and this Ethan, and hold Chalcol and Darda to be, like them, contemporaries with Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/4-31.htm" title="For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.">1 Kings 4:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">He was wiser than all men — </span>Either of his nation, or of his time: or, of all times and nations, whether of the East, or any other country, excepting only the first and second Adam. <span class="ital">Ethan, </span>&c. — Israelites of eminent wisdom, probably the same mentioned <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm" title="And the sons of Zerah; Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all.">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-19.htm" title="So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/25-4.htm" title="Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>; Psalms 88., title, and 89., title. <span class="ital">Chalcol, </span>&c. — Of whom see <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm" title="And the sons of Zerah; Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all.">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:29-34 Solomon's wisdom was more his glory than his wealth. He had what is here called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom.

In that passage we find (with a slight modification of the last) the four names of this verse all mentioned as sons of Zerah, the son of Judah. These would therefore be greatgrandsons of Jacob. The difference between the name Darda <span class="greekheb">דרדע</span> and Dara <span class="greekheb">דרע</span> (of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm" title="And the sons of Zerah; Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all.">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>) may be due only to a slip of the transcriber. But no tradition has survived which tells of the special wisdom of this family, nor can we connect the name <span class="ital">Mahol</span>, as the father of some of them at least is here called, with <span class="ital">Zerah</span>. But the occurrence of the four names together in one family inclines to the opinion that these men were the men spoken of here. Their fame, even if not at first great, may have grown so during the time between Judah and Solomon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in all nations</span>] We know that it had reached the queen of Sheba.

It is very doubtful whether the names mentioned presently are those of contemporaries] <span class="cmt_word">than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda</span> [It is impossible to say whether these are the same persons as the Ethan and Heman and Chalcol and Dara of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>, or the Ethan and Heman who were David's singers. The resemblance is certainly remarkable. Not only are the names practically the same (<span class="accented">Dara</span> may well be a clerical error: many MSS., together with the Syr. and Arab., read <span class="accented">Darda</span>), but they occur in the same order. Our first impression, consequently, is that the two lists represent the same persons, and if so, these four sages were the "sons" of Zerah, the son of Judah (<a href="/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a>). But against this it is urged that Ethan is here called the Ezrahite, as are both Ethan and Heman in the titles of <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, and 88. respectively. The resemblance, however, of Ezrahite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) to Zerahite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is so close as to suggest identity rather than difference. There is, perhaps, more weight in the objection that Chalcol and Darda are here distinctly said to be "the sons of Mahol," though here again it has been observed that Mahol (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means <span class="accented">pipe</span> or <span class="accented">dance</span>, and the "sons of Mahol," consequently, may merely be a synonym, agreeably to Eastern idiom (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>, with which cf. <a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>), for "musicians." We may therefore allow that the four names may be those of sons (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, descendants) of Zerah. But the question now presents itself: Are Ethan and Heman to be identified with the well known precentors of David? Against their identity are these facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Ethan the singer (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-31.htm">1 Chronicles 6:31</a>) is described as the son of Kishi (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>), elsewhere called Kushaiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>), and of the family of Merari; as a Levite that is, instead of a descendant of Judah, and that Heman, who is called the singer, or musician (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>), and the "king's seer" (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>) is said to be a son of Joel, a grandson of the prophet Samuel, and one of the Kohathite Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>). The first impression in this case, therefore, is that they <span class="accented">must be</span> distinct. But it should be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the sons - in the strict sense - of Zerah are nowhere else named for their wisdom, whereas the royal singer and seer probably owed their appointments to their genius, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that though Levites, they may have been incorporated (possibly like Jair, through marriage - see note on ver. 13 above, and cf. <a href="/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61</a>) into the tribe of Judah. The Levite in <a href="/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a> is spoken of as belonging to the family of Judah, because he dwelt in Bethlehem of Judah, and Elkanah the Levite is called an  Ephraimite in <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, because in his civil capacity he was incorporated into the tribe of Ephraim" (Keil). It must be admitted, however, that the <span class="accented">natural</span> interpretation of <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a> is that the "sons" of Zerah there mentioned were his immediate and actual descendants, and not Levites who long centuries afterwards were somehow incorporated into his family.
