But this seems too narrow a compass for one of these great officers, and unequal to the rest; although these portions seem not to be distributed into equal portions of land, but into larger or lesser parts, according to their fertility or barrenness.

It is very improbable that the proper names should have dropped out five times (as Clericus, Michaelis, and others suppose); and consequently there is simply the assumption left, that the persons in question bore their fathers' names with Ben prefixed as their own proper names: Benhur, Bendeker, etc., after the analogy of Benchanan in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-20.htm">1 Chronicles 4:20</a> and others, although such a proper name as Ben-Abinadab (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-11.htm">1 Chronicles 4:11</a>) appears very strange. Benhur was stationed on the mountains of Ephraim.
