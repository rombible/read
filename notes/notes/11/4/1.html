This feature well introduces the glory of Solomon and the organisation of the court, of which the historian in this chapter intends to give us a general sketch. Solomon constitutes certain "princes" or officers of the first rank, deriving their station from him, and probably holding it during pleasure. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>1Ki 4:1-6.

Two harlots living together in one house had each given birth to a child, and one of them had "overlaid" her child in the night while asleep (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, because she had lain upon it), and had then placed her dead child in the other one's bosom and taken her living child away. When the other woman looked the next morning at the child lying in her bosom, she saw that it was not her own but the other woman's child, whereas the latter maintained the opposite. As they eventually referred the matter in dispute to the king, and each one declared that the living child was her own, the king ordered a sword to be brought, and the living child to be cut in two, and a half given to each. Then the mother of the living child, "because her bowels yearned upon her son," i.e., her maternal love was excited, cried out, "Give her (the other) the living child, but do not slay it;" whereas the latter said, "It shall be neither mine nor thine, cut it in pieces." </body></html>
