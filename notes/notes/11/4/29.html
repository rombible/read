The “wisdom of God” (see, for example, Proverbs 8) is, in relation to man, His Divine purpose in the creation and government of the world, which all things work out. The “wisdom of man” is the knowledge of the true end and object of his own being—which if he fulfil not, it were better for him not to have been born—whether that object be called happiness or perfection. For such knowledge the Book of Ecclesiastes describes a vain search. Such knowledge, as found already, is embodied in the Proverbs; sometimes in the lowest sense of knowledge of what will conduce to our own happiness; sometimes in the higher knowledge of what will best serve man; most often in the supreme knowledge, how we may best do God’s will and show forth His glory. (<span class= "ital">b</span>) But, since the purpose of our own being cannot be discovered, if our life be regarded as isolated from the history of the world and from its great design, this wisdom in man is regarded as possible, only when he has some glimpse of the wisdom of God, as manifested to man in His visible Providence, in His declared law, and His special revelation to the soul. Hence, “the fear of the Lord” is its “beginning;” and faith in God is the supplement of its necessary imperfection. (<span class= "ital">c</span>)<span class= "ital">It </span>will be obvious that, even so considered, this desire for wisdom is more self-contained and self-conscious than “the thirst for God, even the living God,” in which the soul of the Psalmist expresses absolute dependence on God. If the sense of the need of God’s revelation and of the necessity of faith beyond knowledge be lost, then this consciousness of wisdom may well become a self-idolatry, in which the mind prides itself on having pierced to the secret of being, holds that by such knowledge it becomes superior to ordinary law and duty, and delights in philosophical contemplation, rather than in active energy and religious devotion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/4-29.htm" title="And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore....">1 Kings 4:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much — </span>Knowledge of a great variety of things, and prudence in the administration of the government. <span class="ital">And largeness of heart — </span>Vastness of understanding, or a very comprehensive mind, capable of receiving the knowledge of all things, both divine and human. <span class="ital">As the sand that is on the sea-shore — </span>As the sand there encloses a vast body of waters, so his mind contained an ocean of knowledge, as the Lord Bacon somewhere speaks. <span class="ital">The wisdom of all the children of the east country — </span>The Chaldeans, Persians, and Arabians, who all lay eastward from Canaan, and were famous in ancient times for their wisdom and learning, the Arabians especially, as appears from the book of Job.

He had what is here called largeness of heart, for the heart is often put for the powers of the mind. He had the gift of utterance, as well as wisdom. It is very desirable, that those who have large gifts of any kind, should have large hearts to use them for the good of others. What treasures of wisdom and knowledge are lost! But every sort of knowledge that is needful for salvation is to be found in the holy Scriptures. There came persons from all parts, who were more eager after knowledge than their neighbours, to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, in whom are hid all treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and hid for us, for he is made of God to us, wisdom. Christ's fame shall spread through all the earth, and men of all nations shall come to him, learn of him, and take upon them his easy yoke, and find rest for their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Largeness of heart - What we call "great capacity."

Stud. und Krit. 1846, pp. 132,133). And "if we reckon 2 lbs. of bread to each person, there would be 14,000 persons in Solomon's court," The consumption of flesh would be quite in proportion to that of bread; for ten fattened oxen, twenty oxen from the pasture, and a hundred sheep, yield more than 21,000 lbs. of meat, that is to say, a pound and a half for each person, "assuming, according to the statements of those who are acquainted with the matter, that the edible meat of a fat ox amounts to 600 lbs., that of an ox from the pasture to 400 lbs., and that of a sheep to 70 lbs." (Thenius ut sup.). This daily consumption of Solomon's court will not appear too great, if, on the one hand, we compare it with the quantity consumed at other oriental courts both of ancient and modern times,<p>(Note: According to Athen. Deipnos. iv. 10, the kings of Persia required a thousand oxen a day; and according to Tavernier, in Rosenmller's A. u. N. Morgenland, iii. pp. 166,167, five hundred sheep and lambs were slaughtered daily for the Sultan's court.)<p>and if, on the other hand, we bear in mind that not only the numerous attendants upon the king and his harem, but also the royal adjutants and the large number of officers employed about the court, were supplied from the king's table, and that their families had also to be fed, inasmuch as the wages in oriental courts are all paid in kind. In addition to this, game was also supplied to the king's table: viz., &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500; stags, &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; gazelles, &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; fallow-deer, and &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; "fattened fowl." The meaning of &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; is doubtful. The earlier translators render it birds or fowl. Kimchi adopts the rendering "capons;" Tanch. Hieroz. "geese," so called from their pure (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;) white feathers; and both Gesenius and Dietrich (Lex.) decide in favour of the latter. The word must denote some special kind of fowl, since edible birds in general were called &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/nehemiah/5-18.htm">Nehemiah 5:18</a>).</body></html>
