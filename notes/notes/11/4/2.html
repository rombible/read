and the note in <a href="/1_kings/4-10.htm" title="The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:">1Kings 4:10</a> (which is apparently out of its right place) seems to show that he was high priest at the time when the Temple was built. The title the “priest” in this place must be given by anticipation, for it is expressly said below that “Zadok and Abiathar were now the priests.” The use of the original word, <span class= "ital">Cohen </span>(probably signifying “one who ministers”), appears sometimes to retain traces of the old times, when the priesthood and headship of the family were united, and to be applied accordingly to princes, to whom perhaps still attached something of the ancient privilege. Thus it is given to the sons of David in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2Samuel 8:18</a>, where the parallel passage in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1Chronicles 18:17</a> has a paraphrase, “chief about the king,” evidently intended to explain the sense in which it is used in the older record. We may remember that David himself on occasions wore the priestly ephod (see <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14</a>). Possibly in this sense it is applied in <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1Kings 4:5</a> to Zabud, the “king’s friend” (where the Authorised Version renders it by <span class= "ital">“</span>principal officer”). But in this verse there is every reason for taking it in the usual sense. Azariah was already a “prince” before he succeeded to the high priesthood. The mingling, of priestly and princely functions is characteristic of the time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/4-2.htm" title="And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,">1 Kings 4:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">These were the princes which he had — </span>The principal officers employed under him. <span class="ital">Azariah the son — </span>Or the grandson; <span class="ital">of Zadok —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-8.htm" title="And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,...">1 Chronicles 6:8-9</a>. <span class="ital">The priest — </span>The second priest, or the priest that attended upon Solomon’s person, in holy offices and administrations.

The term used &#1499;&#1492;&#1503;  ko&#770;he&#770;n means sometimes a priest, sometimes a civil officer, with perhaps a semi-priestly character. (See <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a> note.) In this place it has the definite article prefixed, and can only mean "the high priest." Azariah, called here the "son," but really the "grandson," of Zadok, seems to have succeeded him in the priesthood <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>. His position as high priest at the time when this list was made out gives Azariah the foremost place in it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. these were the princes&#8212;or chief officers, as is evident from two of them marrying Solomon's daughters.<p>Azariah the son of Zadok the priest&#8212;rather, "the prince," as the Hebrew word frequently signifies (Ge 41:45; Ex 2:16; 2Sa 8:18); so that from the precedency given to his person in the list, he seems to have been prime minister, the highest in office next the king.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The princes which he had, </span> i.e. the chief rulers or officers belonging to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The son, </span> or, the grandson, by comparing this with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/6-8.htm" title="And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,">1 Chronicles 6:8</a>,9</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of Zadok; </span> either Zadok the priest, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/6-8.htm" title="And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,">1 Chronicles 6:8</a>,9</span>, or some other of that name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The priest; </span> So he was the second priest, or the priest that attended upon Solomon’s person in holy offices and administrations.

The Vat. LXX. omits the title, but the Alex. text has <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἱερεύς</span>. On the contrary the Vulgate renders ‘Sadoc <span class="ital">Sacerdotis</span>.’ The Zadok here named is the son of Ahitub (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-8.htm" title="And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,">1 Chronicles 6:8</a>), and Azariah was really his grandson, the order being Zadok-Ahimaaz-Azariah. The use of ‘son’ thus loosely for grandson is not uncommon in the Old Test. Thus (<a href="/genesis/29-5.htm" title="And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.">Genesis 29:5</a>) Laban is called the <span class="ital">son</span> of Nahor. He was really the son of Bethuel. Similarly (<a href="/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a>) Zachariah the prophet is called the <span class="ital">son</span> of Iddo, though Barachiah was his father and Iddo his grandfather.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words ‘the priest’ have caused much discussion, and on the margin of the A.V. ‘chief officer’ is given as an alternative meaning. That the word may have another sense seems plain from <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2 Samuel 8:18</a>. In that passage the same word is used of David’s sons, and is rendered ‘chief rulers’ or ‘princes’ in A.V. The R.V. translates ‘priests’ in the text, with ‘chief ministers’ in the margin. We can hardly however think that David’s sons were priests. But in the verse before us Azariah belongs to the priestly family, as much as Zadok and Abiathar who are called ‘priests’ (the same Hebrew word) in <a href="/1_kings/4-4.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:">1 Kings 4:4</a>. Where there is no such connexion with the priestly line, Zabud the son of Nathan, in <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1 Kings 4:5</a>, is styled ‘principal officer’; the R.V. is consistent and renders ‘priest’ there too, but puts ‘chief minister’ as an alternative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is probably on account of the difficulty of so many persons being called by the title usually rendered ‘priest’ that the LXX. omits the title both after Azariah’s name, and after Zabud’s, calling the latter merely <span class="greekheb">ἑταῖρος τοῦ βασιλέως</span>. It seems clear however from the instance of David’s sons that the title had a sense in which it could be applied to others than those of the priestly line.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these were the princes</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> ministers, officers.

It is true that this view obviates some difficulties, but against it are these considerations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The accents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Chaldee and LXX.

The question is one of some nicety, but the balance of evidence is distinctly in favour of connecting the title with Azariah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Azariah son of Zadok was the priest." This brings us to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> What are we to understand by "the priest " - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>? It is urged by Keil, Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span> that this cannot mean "priest" in the ordinary sense of the word, still less "high priest," for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Because the high priests of Solomon are mentioned presently, viz., Abiathar and Zadok, and the Jews never had <span class="accented">three</span> high priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because the Azariah who was high priest under Solomon for the words of <a href="/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>, "He it is that executed the priest's office," etc, must belong to the Azariah of ver. 9, and have got accidentally misplaced - was the son of Ahimaaz, not of Zadok. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because no grandson of Zadok could then be old enough to sustain the office of high priest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Because in one passage (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, compared with <a href="/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>) <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is used of privy councillors and of the sons of <span class="accented">David</span>, who cannot have been sacrificing priests. Keil consequently would understand that Azariah was "administrator of the kingdom, or prime minister." Similarly Bahr. But in favour of the ordinary meaning of the word are these powerful considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> All the versions translate the word by "priest," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they understand by the term a spiritual person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Whatever may be the case with <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> priest" (<span class="accented">par excellence</span>) can only be understood of the <span class="accented">high</span> priest (ch. 1:8, 38; <a href="/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-21.htm">Leviticus 21:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9, 15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4, 8, 10, 12, 14</a>. Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is extremely doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is ever used except in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, Rawlinson, who says it sometimes indicates "a civil officer, with perhaps a semi-priestly character," refers to Gesenius <span class="accented">sub hac voce</span>, who, however, distinctly affirms that the word only means priest, and accounts for the application of the term to the sons of David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>) on the supposition that the Jews had priests who were not of the tribe of Levi. The question is discussed with great learning by Professor Plumptre (Dict. Bib., art. "Priest"), who suggests that "David and his sons may have been admitted, not to distinctively priestly functions, such as burning incense (<a href="/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>), but to an honorary, titular priesthood. To wear the ephod in processions (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) at the time when this was the special badge of the order (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>), to join the priests and Levites in their songs and dances, might have been conceded, with no deviation from the Law, to the members of the royal house." There is one difficulty however in the way of accepting this ingenious and otherwise sufficient explanation, namely, that it seems hardly likely that the title of priest would be freely accorded by Hebrew writers to men who were expressly <span class="accented">excluded</span> from all "distinctively priestly functions," especially after the use of the same word in the preceding verse (17) to designate the high priest. And I venture to suggest that the discharge by David's sons of the semi-priestly functions just referred to occasioned so much remark as to head to the application of the term "priest" to them in a special conventional sense; in fact, that it became a sort of <span class="accented">soubriquet</span>, which rather implied that they were <span class="accented">not</span> priests than that they were. (Notice <span class="accented">the order</span> of <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, Hebrews) And observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> if we are to understand by "the <span class="accented">priest"</span> in ver. 2, "prime minister;" by <span class="accented">"priests"</span> in ver. 4, "high priests," and by <span class="accented">"priest"</span> in ver 5, "principal officer," language has no certain meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The mention of Azariah as "the priest" in the same list with Zadok and Abiathar is easily accounted for. We know that Abiathar was deposed at the beginning of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27</a>), and Zadok must then have been an old man. Their names consequently are  recorded (ver. 4) because they were high priests for a brief period of the reign, but Azariah is mentioned first as "the priest" because he was high priest during most of the time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> "Azariah the <span class="accented">son</span> of Zadok" is quite compatible with the fact that Azariah was really the son of Ahimaaz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is constantly used in the sense of "descendant," and especially "grandson." (<a href="/genesis/29-5.htm">Genesis 29:5</a>: 31:28, 55: and see on ch. 2:8,"the son of Gera.") Zadok is no doubt mentioned as better known than Ahimaaz, and probably because Azariah succeeded him directly in the office. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The age of Azariah must be uncertain, and Solomon's reign was a long one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The position of his name - first - accords well with the idea that he was high priest, which I conclude that he was. It is worthy of remark that in the lists of David the military officers of the kingdom occupy the first place; in those of Solomon, the civil and religious dignitaries. "The princes of Solomon are, with one exception (ver. 4) ministers of peace." - Wordsworth. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Solomon's Judicial Wisdom. - As a proof that the Lord had bestowed upon Solomon unusual judicial wisdom, there is appended a decision of his in a very difficult case, in which Solomon had shown extraordinary intelligence. Two harlots living together in one house had each given birth to a child, and one of them had "overlaid" her child in the night while asleep (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, because she had lain upon it), and had then placed her dead child in the other one's bosom and taken her living child away. When the other woman looked the next morning at the child lying in her bosom, she saw that it was not her own but the other woman's child, whereas the latter maintained the opposite. As they eventually referred the matter in dispute to the king, and each one declared that the living child was her own, the king ordered a sword to be brought, and the living child to be cut in two, and a half given to each. Then the mother of the living child, "because her bowels yearned upon her son," i.e., her maternal love was excited, cried out, "Give her (the other) the living child, but do not slay it;" whereas the latter said, "It shall be neither mine nor thine, cut it in pieces." </body></html>
