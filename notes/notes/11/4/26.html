They were kept in various “chariot cities,” as well as at Jerusalem. This multiplication of horses and horsemen—forbidden to the future king in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, but foretold by Samuel at the inauguration of the kingdom (<a href="/context/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1Samuel 8:11-12</a>)—is significant of military conquest and an extended empire. The Israelite armies, in frequent contradistinction from their enemies, had been hitherto mainly of infantry; and in <a href="/joshua/11-9.htm" title="And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:9</a> the chariots and horses captured were not used, but destroyed, “as the Lord bade Joshua.” Such armies were powerful for defence, not for invasion. Now, as it would seem for the first time, this provision of the ancient law, like many others, was set aside, and Solomon’s empire assumed the character of other great Oriental monarchies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm" title="And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.">1 Kings 4:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for chariots — </span>In <a href="/2_chronicles/9-25.htm" title="And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>, it is said, he had but <span class="ital">four thousand. </span>And Bochart thinks that the Hebrew word here used should be rendered <span class="ital">four, </span>not <span class="ital">forty, </span>or that some error has crept into the text in regard to the number here mentioned.

He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of the Messiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen for his inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritual peace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of the Lord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not, as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number of his attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provision daily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all his subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which endures to eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>, the number of stalls for Solomon's chariot horses is stated at 4,000, instead of 40,000. The number in the present passage is probably a corruption. Solomon's chariots were but 1,400 <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a>, for which 40,000 horses could not possibly be required. The Assyrian chariots had at most three horses apiece, while some had only two. 4,000 horses would supply the full team of three to 1,200, and the smaller team of two to 200 chariots. The number 4,000 is in due proportion to the 12,000 horses for cavalry, and is in accordance with all that we know of the military establishments of the time and country.

First, Some acknowledge an error of the transcriber, writing <span class="ital">arbahim</span>, forty, for <span class="ital">arbah</span>, four, which was an easy mistake.

In <a href="/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>; it is only four thousand; and therefore some think that here is a mistake of the copier, of "arbaim", forty, for "arbah", four; which it is thought might be through divine permission, in such lesser matters, without any prejudice to the authority of the Scriptures in matters of faith and practice; but without supposing this, a reconciliation may be made, by observing, that here the writer, as Ben Gersom notes, gives the number of the horses that were in the stables, which were forty thousand, there the stables themselves, which were four thousand, ten horses in a stable; or here he numbers the stalls, which were forty thousand, and there the stables, which were four thousand, there being ten stalls in each; and the word there has the letter "yod" in it more than here, which is the numerical letter for "ten", and may point thereunto; or here the writer speaks of all the stalls for horses Solomon had throughout the kingdom, there of those only he had in Jerusalem. Benjamin of Tudela (g) affirms, that these stalls, or stables, which Solomon built very strong of large stones, are still in being in Jerusalem, and that there is no building to be seen like it any where; but no other writer speaks of them; nor is it at all probable that they should remain: <p>for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; some of the said stalls of horses were for his chariots, to draw in them for various uses, of which had 1400, <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>; and others to mount twelve thousand horsemen, who were placed in various parts, to defend kingdom. <p>(g) Itinerar. p. 43. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">horses for his chariots</span>] This is one of the passages which make clear the meaning of the Hebrew <span class="ital">sus</span>, a horse to go in a chariot, and <span class="ital">parash</span>, a saddle-horse.

Now for 1400 chariots the proper allowance of horses would be about 4000. We see from the monuments that it was customary to yoke two horses (seldom three) to a chariot; but a third or supernumerary horse was provided to meet emergencies or accidents. 4000 horses would hence be a liberal provision for Solomon's chariots, and it would also agree well with the number of his cavalry. 12,000 cavalry and 40,000 chariot horses are out of all proportion. As to stalls, it seems clear that in ancient, as in modern times, each horse had a separate crib (Vegetins in Bochart, quoted by Keil). Gesenius, however, understands by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, not <span class="accented">stalls</span>, but <span class="accented">teams</span>, or <span class="accented">pairs</span>] <span class="cmt_word">for his chariots</span> [or <span class="accented">chariotry</span>: the word is singular and collective] <span class="cmt_word">and twelve hundred horsemen</span> [rather, <span class="accented">horses, i.e.</span>, riding or cavalry, as distinguished from chariot horses above. See note on 1 Kings 1:5. It has been supposed that this warlike provision is mentioned to account for the peace ("<span class="accented">si vis pacem, para bellum"</span>) of Solomon's reign, and was designed to overawe the tributary kings. But it is more probable that the idea of the historian was, partly to exhibit the pomp and circumstance of Israel's greatest king, and partly to record a contravention of the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>), which was one of the precursors of his fall]. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a> the account of Solomon's officers is closed by a general remark as to the prosperous condition of the whole nation; though we miss the copula Vav at the commencement.
