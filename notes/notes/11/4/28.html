He had peace on all sides. Herein, his kingdom was a type of the Messiah's; for to Him it is promised that he shall have the heathen for his inheritance, and that princes shall worship him. The spiritual peace, and joy, and holy security, of all the faithful subjects of the Lord Jesus, were typified by that of Israel. The kingdom of God is not, as Solomon's was, meat and drink, but, what is infinitely better, righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. The vast number of his attendants, and the great resort to him, are shown by the provision daily made. Herein Christ far outdoes Solomon, that he feeds all his subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but with that which endures to eternal life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Barley is to this day in the East the common food of horses.<p>Dromedaries - Coursers.

There we learn that the horses were distributed in different towns throughout the land. To these different depots, therefore, the purveyors must forward the provender, "unto the place where it should be" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), not, as Rawlinson, "where the horses were."] every man according to his charge. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The daily consumption of &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; (food or provisions) amounted to thirty cors of fine meal (&#1505;&#1500;&#1514;  equals  &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1505;&#1500;&#1514;, fine sifted meal, <a href="/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2</a>; for &#1505;&#1500;&#1514; see also <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>), and sixty cors of &#1511;&#1502;&#1495;, ordinary meal, ten fattened oxen, twenty pasture oxen, which were brought directly from the pasture and slaughtered, and a hundred sheep, beside different kinds of game. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, the later name for &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, the largest dry and also liquid (<a href="/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>), measure of capacity, contained ten ephahs or baths, i.e., according to the calculation made by Thenius, 15,300 cubic inches (Dresden)  equals  about 1 7/8 scheffel;<p>(Note: The scheffel is about an English sack (vid., Flgel's Dict.). - Tr.)<p>so that ninety cors would amount to 171 scheffel, from which 28,000 lbs. of bread could be baked (Theol. Stud. und Krit. 1846, pp. 132,133). And "if we reckon 2 lbs. of bread to each person, there would be 14,000 persons in Solomon's court," The consumption of flesh would be quite in proportion to that of bread; for ten fattened oxen, twenty oxen from the pasture, and a hundred sheep, yield more than 21,000 lbs. of meat, that is to say, a pound and a half for each person, "assuming, according to the statements of those who are acquainted with the matter, that the edible meat of a fat ox amounts to 600 lbs., that of an ox from the pasture to 400 lbs., and that of a sheep to 70 lbs." (Thenius ut sup.). This daily consumption of Solomon's court will not appear too great, if, on the one hand, we compare it with the quantity consumed at other oriental courts both of ancient and modern times,<p>(Note: According to Athen. Deipnos. iv. 10, the kings of Persia required a thousand oxen a day; and according to Tavernier, in Rosenmller's A. u. N. Morgenland, iii. pp. 166,167, five hundred sheep and lambs were slaughtered daily for the Sultan's court.)<p>and if, on the other hand, we bear in mind that not only the numerous attendants upon the king and his harem, but also the royal adjutants and the large number of officers employed about the court, were supplied from the king's table, and that their families had also to be fed, inasmuch as the wages in oriental courts are all paid in kind. In addition to this, game was also supplied to the king's table: viz., &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500; stags, &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; gazelles, &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; fallow-deer, and &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; "fattened fowl." The meaning of &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; is doubtful. The earlier translators render it birds or fowl. Kimchi adopts the rendering "capons;" Tanch. Hieroz. "geese," so called from their pure (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;) white feathers; and both Gesenius and Dietrich (Lex.) decide in favour of the latter. The word must denote some special kind of fowl, since edible birds in general were called &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/nehemiah/5-18.htm">Nehemiah 5:18</a>).</body></html>
