Solomon's Adversaries.<p>14-25. the Lord stirred up an adversary&#8212;that is, permitted him, through the impulse of his own ambition, or revenge, to attack Israel. During the war of extermination, which Joab carried on in Edom (2Sa 8:13), this Hadad, of the royal family, a mere boy when rescued from the sword of the ruthless conqueror, was carried into Egypt, hospitably entertained, and became allied with the house of the Egyptian king. In after years, the thought of his native land and his lost kingdom taking possession of his mind, he, on learning the death of David and Joab, renounced the ease, possessions, and glory of his Egyptian residence, to return to Edom and attempt the recovery of his ancestral throne. The movements of this prince seem to have given much annoyance to the Hebrew government; but as he was defeated by the numerous and strong garrisons planted throughout the Edomite territory, Hadad seems to have offered his services to Rezon, another of Solomon's adversaries (1Ki 11:23-25). This man, who had been general of Hadadezer and, on the defeat of that great king, had successfully withdrawn a large force, went into the wilderness, led a predatory life, like Jephthah, David, and others, on the borders of the Syrian and Arabian deserts. Then, having acquired great power, he at length became king in Damascus, threw off the yoke, and was "the adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon." He was succeeded by Hadad, whose successors took the official title of Ben-hadad from him, the illustrious founder of the powerful kingdom of Damascene-Syria. These hostile neighbors, who had been long kept in check by the traditional fame of David's victories, took courage; and breaking out towards the latter end of Solomon's reign, they must have not only disturbed his kingdom by their inroads, but greatly crippled his revenue by stopping his lucrative traffic with Tadmor and the Euphrates.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He was a secret enemy, watching all occasions to do them mischief cunningly and privately all that time; and when Solomon had forsaken God, and was forsaken by God, he showed himself more openly and maliciously. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beside the mischief that Hadad did; </span> so the sense is, this infelicity was added to the former concerning Hadad, mentioned above, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm" title="And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.">1 Kings 11:14</a></span>, &c. Whilst Hadad molested him in the south, Rezon threatened him in the north. But some understand this of Hadadezer, who is here called Hadad, by way of abbreviation, (which is not unusual in proper Hebrew names, as is well known,)<span class="ital"> and that for</span>, or <span class="ital">because of</span>, (for the Hebrew particle <span class="ital">eth</span> is sometimes put for <span class="ital">el</span>, which oft signifies <span class="ital">for</span>, or <span class="ital">because of</span>, as Hebricians know,) <span class="ital">the evil which befell Hadad</span>, or Hadadezer, i.e. he bore a grudge against the Israelites from and ever since the slaughter that Joab made in Hadadezer’s army, whereof he was a member, although he also took that occasion of making a defection from his master. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Reigned over Syria; </span> over all that part of Syria, enlarging his empire more and more, and thereby laying a foundation for much misery to Solomon’s house and kingdom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,....

For some time he would be obliged to collect his strength to be ready for future attacks on Israel, but he may well have been a source of anxiety to Solomon from the first. Damascus was near enough, and a band of men such as those who supported Rezon would make a constant thorn for Solomon’s side, even though they attempted no regular warfare.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beside the mischief that Hadad</span> did] This sentence can only be thus translated. There is a similar rendering of the like Hebrew <span class="greekheb">ואת</span> in <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1 Kings 11:1</a> ‘together with’ the daughter of Pharaoh (marg. R.V. ‘besides’). But it is very questionable whether this can be so rendered. The LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat.</span>) which omits 23, 24, and great part of the present verse renders as if, for <span class="greekheb">ואת</span>, they had read <span class="greekheb">זאת</span> = this. See the LXX. variations above, in note on <a href="/1_kings/11-22.htm" title="Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that, behold, you seek to go to your own country? And he answered, Nothing: however, let me go in any wise.">1 Kings 11:22</a>. These make the whole passage refer not to Rezon but to Hadad, and in consequence the word <span class="ital">Syria</span>, <span class="greekheb">ארם</span>, i.e. Aram, is changed into <span class="greekheb">אדם</span>, <span class="ital">Edom</span>, and it is certain that we do expect to hear more of the mischief which Hadad wrought. All we are told is that he got permission to come back to Edom. But we hear no word of any armament or invasion by him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he abhorred Israel</span>] Though he had deserted Hadadezer this was no reason why he should side with the Israelitish invaders. They had driven him and his troop into the wilderness and no harm which he could work upon them would be left undone. This is just the sort of opponent who might worry Solomon for a long time without being deemed serious, but who might before the end of Solomon’s reign, in the period of that king’s unwise yielding to his wives, become really a dangerous adversary. With Hadad in the south and Rezon on the north, each growing daily stronger, the crippling of Solomon’s power was effectually begun.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon</span> [We are not compelled, however, to believe that his reign lasted "all the days of Solomon." This last expression is to be taken with considerable latitude. It is an Orientalism. At the time of <a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a>, neither Hadad nor Rezon was giving Solomon any trouble], <span class="cmt_word">beside the mischief which Hadad did</span> [Heb. omits <span class="accented">did</span>.

Literally, and with the evil which Hadad," etc. (comp. ver. 1 of this chapter, "and with the daughter," etc., with <a href="/exodus/1-14.htm">Exodus 1:14</a>, Hebrews) The LXX. reconstructs the text, making the following words, "and he abhorred," etc., apply to Hadad; and altering Syria (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span>) into Eden (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e1;&#x5dd;</span>) to suit.

"And he (Rezon) abhorred," etc. Hadad's enmity has already been described (vers. 17-22), and the historian has passed on to the case of Rezon. It is extremely unlikely that he should now suddenly recur exclusively to Hadad. It is very natural for him, on the other hand, in his account of Rezon, to remind us that all this was in addition to the mischief wrought by Hadad]: <span class="cmt_word">and he abhorred</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">loathed</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Paran they took men with them as guides through the desert. Thus Hadad came to Egypt, where Pharaoh received him hospitably, and gave them a house and maintenance (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;), and also assigned him land (&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;) to cultivate for the support of the fugitives who had come with him, and eventually, as he found great favour in his eyes, gave him for a wife the sister of his own wife, queen Tachpenes, who bare him a son, Genubath. This son was weaned by Tachpenes in the royal palace, and then brought up among (with) the children of Pharaoh, the royal princes. According to Rosellini and Wilkinson (Ges. Thes. p. 1500), Tachpenes was also the name of a female deity of Egypt. The wife of Pharaoh is called &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., the mistress among the king's wives, as being the principal consort. In the case of the kings of Judah this title is given to the king's mother, probably as the president in the harem, whose place was taken by the reigning queen after her death. The weaning, probably a family festival as among the Hebrews (<a href="/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a>) and other ancient nations (vid., Dougtaei Analecta ss . i. 22f.), was carried out by the queen in the palace, because the boy was to be thereby adopted among the royal children, to be brought up with them.</body></html>
