Sin shortened his days. If the world, with all its advantages, could satisfy the soul, and afford real joy, Solomon would have found it so. But he was disappointed in all, and to warn us, has left this record of all earthly enjoyments, Vanity and vexation of spirit. The New Testament declares that one greater than Solomon is come to reign over us, and to possess the throne of his father David. May we not see something of Christ's excellency faintly represented to us in this figure?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Josephus gave Solomon a reign of 80 years, either because he wished to increase the glory of his country's greatest king, or through his having a false reading in his copy of the Septuagint Version. It is, no doubt, remarkable that the three successive kings, Saul, David, and Solomon, should have each reigned forty years <a href="/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>; but such numerical coincidences occur from time to time in exact history. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40.

But hence interpreters question, whether Solomon was saved, or damned? That he was damned, some believe upon this only argument, that he died without repentance; which they gather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because his repentance is not mentioned in his history. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because if he had repented, he would have abolished the monuments of idolatry which he had erected; which that he did not they gather from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a></span>, of which (God assisting) I shall speak upon that place. But to the former many things may be said: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. We read nothing of the repentance of Adam, Noah, after his drunkenness, Lot, Samson, Asa, &c.; shall we therefore conclude they were all damned? The silence of the Scripture is a very weak argument in matters of history. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. If he did repent, yet the silence of the Scripture about it in this history was not without wise reasons; as, among others, that his eternal condition being thus far left doubtful, his example might have the greater influence for the terror and caution of future offenders. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. His repentance is sufficiently implied in this, (to omit divers other passages,) that after Solomonâ€™s death <span class="ital">the way of Solomon</span> is mentioned with honour, and joined with the way of David, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/11-17.htm" title="So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.">2 Chronicles 11:17</a></span>. But it seems to be put out of dispute by the Book of Ecclesiastes, which (by the general consent both of Jewish and Christian interpreters) was written by Solomon, and that after his fall, as is evident, not only from the unanimous testimony of the Hebrew writers, who thence conclude that he did repent, and was saved; but also from the whole strain of that book, which was written long after he had finished all his works, and after he had liberally drunk of all sorts of sensual pleasures, and sadly experienced the bitter effects of his love of women, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm" title="Behold, this have I found, said the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a></span>, &c; which makes it more than probable, that as David wrote <span class="bld"> Psa 51</span>, so Solomon wrote this book, as a public testimony and profession of his repentance. And this argument is so cogent, that those interpreters who are of the other opinion confess it, if Solomon did write this book after his fall, which they pretend he wrote before it; but they offer not any argument to prove it. And therefore we have reason to conclude that Solomon did repent, and was saved. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Solomon slept with his fathers,....
