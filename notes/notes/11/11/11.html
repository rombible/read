Milcom was at any rate related to the Chemosh of the Moabites mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; for Chemosh is also described as a god of the Ammonites in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>, whereas everywhere else he is called the god of the Moabites (<a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, etc.). Chemosh was a sun-god, who was worshipped as king of his people and as a god of war, and as such is depicted upon coins with a sword, lance, and shield in his hands, and with two torches by his side (see at <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>).
