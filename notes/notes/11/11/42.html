(See <a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm" title="And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.">1Kings 2:11</a>.) The coincidence is curious; but the accurate historical character of the whole narrative forbids the idea that the numbers given are merely round numbers, signifying long duration. Josephus gives eighty years—either by error in his Hebrew text, or perhaps by confusing together the duration of the two reigns.<p><span class= "bld">NOTE.</span>—The insertion in the LXX. version, found in the Vatican MS. after <a href="/1_kings/12-24.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They listened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.">1Kings 12:24</a>, runs as follows :—<p>“And there was a man of Mount Ephraim, a servant of Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam; and his mother’s name was Sarira, a woman who was a harlot. And Solomon made him taskmaster [literally, “master of the staff,” or “scourge”] over the burdens [forced labours] of the house of Joseph; and he built for Solomon Sarira, which is in Mount Ephraim; and he had three hundred chariots. He it was who built the citadel [the “Millo”], by the labours of the house of Ephraim, and completed the fortification of the city of David. And he was exalting himself to seek the kingdom. And Solomon sought to put him to death; so he feared, and stole away to Sousakim [Shishak], king of Egypt, and was with him till the death of Solomon. And Jeroboam heard in Egypt that Solomon was dead, and he spake in the ears of Sousakim, king of Egypt, saying, Send me away, and I will go back to my own land. And Sousakim said to him, Ask of me a request, and I will give it thee. And he gave to Jeroboam Ano, the elder sister of his own wife Thekemina [Tahpenes] to be his wife. She was great among the daughters of the king, and bare to Jeroboam Abias [Abijah] his son. And Jeroboam said to Sousakim, Send me really away, and I will go back. And Jeroboam went forth from Egypt, and came to the land of Sarira, in Mount Ephraim, and there gathered together to him the whole strength of Ephraim. And Jeroboam built there a fortress.”<p>Then follows, with variations of detail, the story of the sickness of Abijah, the visit of Jeroboam’s wife to Ahijah, and the message of judgment; corresponding to <a href="/context/1_kings/14-1.htm" title="At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.">1Kings 14:1-18</a>. The narrative then continues thus:—<p>“ And Jeroboam went his way to Shechem, in Mount Ephraim, and gathered together there the tribes of Israel; and Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, went up there. And the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the Enlamite, saying. Take to thyself a new garment, which has never been in water, and tear it in ten pieces; and thou shalt give them to Jeroboam, and shalt say to him, Take thee ten pieces, to clothe thyself therewith. And Jeroboam took them; and Shemaiah said, These things saith the Lord, signifying the ten tribes of Israel.”<p>The whole concludes with an account, given with some characteristic variations, of the remonstrance with Rehoboam, the rebellion, and the prohibition by Shemaiah of the intended attack of Rehoboam, corresponding to <a href="/context/1_kings/12-1.htm" title="And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.">1Kings 12:1-24</a>.<p>This half-independent version of the history is interesting, but obviously far inferior in authority to the Hebrew text. The incidents fit less naturally into each other; the warning of Ahijah as to the destruction of the house of Jeroboam is obviously out of place; and by the ascription to Shemaiah of the prophecy of Jeroboam’s royalty, the striking coincidence of the authorship of the two predictions of prosperity and disaster is lost. The record of Shishak’s intercourse with Jeroboam is apparently imitated from the history of Hadad at the court of the earlier Pharaoh; and the circumstances of Jeroboam’s assumption of royal pretensions are improbable. Josephus, moreover, ignores this version of the story altogether; nor is it found in any other version. Its origin is unknown, and its growth curious enough. But it does not seem to throw much fresh light on the history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/11-42.htm" title="And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years....">1 Kings 11:42-43</a></span>. <span class="ital">The time that Solomon reigned — was forty years — </span>His reign was as long as his father’s, but not his life: sin shortened his days. <span class="ital">And Solomon slept with his fathers — </span>This expression is promiscuously used concerning good and bad, and signifies only, that they died as their fathers did. <span class="ital">And was buried in the city of David his father — </span>Thus concludes the history of this great man; without any the least mention of his repentance, or of his bringing forth any of the proper fruits of repentance, such as pulling down the high places he had built for the worship of idols, and abandoning his idolatrous wives and concubines. Many Jews and Christians, however, think it extremely probable that he was awakened to a sense of his sin and misery by means of the message which God sent him, as recorded <a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm" title="Why the LORD said to Solomon, For as much as this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely rend the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.">1 Kings 11:11</a>; and that he humbled himself before him, and became a true penitent from that time. They even judge that this is put out of dispute by the book of Ecclesiastes, written after his fall, as, they say, is evident, not only from the unanimous testimony of the Hebrew writers, but also from the whole strain of that book, which was manifestly composed long after he had finished all his works, and after he had liberally drunk of all sorts of sensual pleasures, and sadly experienced the bitter effects of the love of women. Now in this book he appears greatly to lament his own folly and madness, <a href="/context/1_kings/7-25.htm" title="It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above on them, and all their hinder parts were inward....">1 Kings 7:25-28</a>; and warns others to take heed of the like evil courses, and to fear God and keep his commandments, in consideration of the judgment to come, chap. <a href="/context/1_kings/11-9.htm" title="And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared to him twice,...">1 Kings 11:9-10</a>, and <a href="/context/1_kings/12-13.htm" title="And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;...">1 Kings 12:13-14</a>. They think it probable, therefore, that as David wrote Psalms 51., so Solomon wrote this book, as a public testimony and profession of his repentance. On the other hand, many are of opinion, that the silence of the divine historian on this subject is an insuperable objection to all this, and that if he had truly repented, so considerable a circumstance of his life would not have been omitted, and that we should, at least, have been informed of his abolishing all the monuments of his idolatry, and those of his wives and concubines. Perhaps, as Dr. Dodd observes, “this is one of those questions which will for ever be a field of controversy, as we have no certain guide from the Scripture to direct us.” We may, however, safely conclude, that if Solomon did repent, yet as the sacred writer has not recorded that he did, but suffered the important circumstance to remain doubtful, he intended to leave a blot upon his memory, that all posterity might have before their eyes an awful example of human weakness, even in a man of the greatest endowments; and might learn thereby to watch and pray lest they should enter into temptation; and to beware of the beginnings and infatuations of vice, since even Solomon was not secure against its delusions; and, once unhappily immersed in it, perhaps, was never disengaged from it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:41-43 Solomon's reign was as long as his father's, but his life was not so.

For the whole of the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a> forms part of the explanation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; which commences with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>, so that &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; is closely connected with &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>, and there is no such gap in the history as is supposed by Thenius, who builds upon this opinion most untenable conjectures as to the intertwining of different sources. At that time, as Jeroboam was one day going out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah of Shilo (Seilun) met him by the way (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;), with a new upper garment wrapped around him; and when they were alone, he rent the new garment, that is to say, his own, not Jeroboam's, as Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 388) erroneously supposes, into twelve pieces, and said to Jeroboam, "Take thee ten pieces, for Jehovah saith, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and give thee ten tribes; and one tribe shall remain to him (Solomon) for David's sake," etc. The new &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; wen ehT . was probably only a large four-cornered cloth, which was thrown over the shoulders like the Heik of the Arabs, and enveloped the whole of the upper portion of the body (see my bibl. Archol. ii. pp. 36, 37). By the tearing of the new garment into twelve pieces, of which Jeroboam was to take ten for himself, the prophetic announcement was symbolized in a very emphatic manner. This symbolical action made the promise a completed fact. "As the garment as torn in pieces and lay before the eyes of Jeroboam, so had the division of the kingdom already taken place in the counsel of God" (O. v. Gerlach). There was something significant also in the circumstance that it was a new garment, which is stated twice, and indicates the newness, i.e., the still young and vigorous condition, of the kingdom (Thenius).<p>In the word of God explaining the action it is striking that Jeroboam was to receive ten tribes, and the one tribe was to remain to Solomon (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-32.htm">1 Kings 11:32</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-35.htm">1 Kings 11:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>, as in <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). The nation consisted of twelve tribes, and Ahijah had torn his garment into twelve pieces, of which Jeroboam was to take ten; so that there were two remaining. It is evident at once from this, that the numbers are intended to be understood symbolically and not arithmetically. Ten as the number of completeness and totality is placed in contrast with one, to indicate that all Israel was to be torn away from the house of David, as is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>, "they made Jeroboam king over all Israel," and only one single fragment was to be left to the house of Solomon out of divine compassion. This one tribe, however, is not Benjamin, the one tribe beside Judah, as Hupfeld (on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>), C. a Lap., Mich., and others suppose, but, according to the distinct statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>, "the tribe of Judah only." Nevertheless Benjamin belonged to Judah; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a>, Rehoboam gathered together the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin to fight against the house of Israel (which had fallen away), and to bring the kingdom again to himself. And so also in <a href="/2_chronicles/11-3.htm">2 Chronicles 11:3</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a> Judah and Benjamin are reckoned as belonging to the kingdom of Rehoboam. This distinct prominence given to Benjamin by the side of Judah overthrows the explanation suggested by Seb. Schmidt and others, namely, that the description of the portion left to Rehoboam as one tribe is to be explained from the fact that Judah and Benjamin, on the border of which Jerusalem was situated, were regarded in a certain sense as one, and that the little Benjamin was hardly taken into consideration at all by the side of the great Judah. For if Ahijah had regarded Benjamin as one with Judah, he would not have torn his garment into twelve pieces, inasmuch as if Benjamin was to be merged in Judah, or was not to be counted along with it as a distinct tribe, the whole nation could only be reckoned as eleven tribes. Moreover the twelve tribes did not so divide themselves, that Jeroboam really received ten tribes and Rehoboam only one or only two. In reality there were three tribes that fell to the kingdom of Judah, and only nine to the kingdom of Israel, Ephraim and Manasseh being reckoned as two tribes, since the tribe of Levi was not counted in the political classification. The kingdom of Judah included, beside the tribe of Judah, both the tribe of Benjamin and also the tribe of Simeon, the territory of which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>, was within the tribe-territory of Judah and completely surrounded by it, so that the Simeonites would have been obliged to emigrate and give up their tribe-land altogether, if they desired to attach themselves to the kingdom of Israel. But it cannot be inferred from <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a> that an emigration of the whole tribe had taken place (see also at <a href="/1_kings/12-17.htm">1 Kings 12:17</a>). On the other hand, whilst the northern border of the tribe of Benjamin, with the cities of Bethel, Ramah, and Jericho, fell to the kingdom of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>, <a href="/1_kings/15-21.htm">1 Kings 15:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>), several of the cities of the tribe of Dan were included in the kingdom of Judah, namely, Ziklag, which Achish had presented to David, and also Zorea and Ajalon (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>), in which Judah obtained compensation for the cities of Benjamin of which it had been deprived.<p>(Note: On the other hand, the fact that in <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a> Benjamin is placed between Ephraim and Manasseh is no proof that it belonged to the kingdom of Israel; for can this be inferred from the fact that Benjamin, as the tribe to which Saul belonged, at the earlier split among the tribes took the side of those which were opposed to David, and that at a still later period a rebellion originated with Benjamin. For in <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a> the exposition is disputed, and the jealousy of Benjamin towards Judah appears to have become extinct with the dying out of the royal house of Saul. Again, the explanation suggested by Oehler (Herzog's Cycl.) of the repeated statement that the house of David was to receive only one tribe, namely, that there was not a single whole tribe belonging to the southern kingdom beside Judah, is by no means satisfactory. For it cannot be proved that any portion of the tribe of Simeon ever belonged to the kingdom of Israel, although the number ten was not complete without it. And it cannot be inferred from <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> that Simeonites had settled outside their tribe-territory. And, as a rule, single families or households that may have emigrated cannot be taken into consideration as having any bearing upon the question before us, since, according to the very same passage of the Chronicles, many members of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh had emigrated to the kingdom of Judah.)<p>Consequently there only remained nine tribes for the northern kingdom. For &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; see at <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm">1 Kings 11:34-36</a> there follows a more precise explanation: Solomon himself is not to lose the kingdom, but to remain prince all his life, and his son is to retain one tribe; both out of regard to David (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-12.htm">1 Kings 11:12</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "but I will set him for prince," inasmuch as leaving him upon the throne was not merely a divine permission, but a divine act. "That there may be a light to my servant David always before me in Jerusalem." This phrase, which is repeated in <a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a>, is to be explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>, where David's regal rule is called the light which God's grace had kindled for Israel, and affirms that David was never to want a successor upon the throne.</body></html>
