Yet the house of David must be supported; out of it the Messiah would arise. Solomon sought to kill his successor. Had not he taught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel. Jeroboam withdrew into Egypt, and was content to live in exile and obscurity for awhile, being sure of a kingdom at last.

The meaning is, "Ahijah, the Shilonite, the prophet, went and took a fit station in the way; and, in order that he might not be known, he wrapped himself up, so as closely to conceal himself, in a new garment, a surtout, which he afterwards tore in twelve pieces." Notwithstanding this privacy, the story, and the prediction connected with it [1Ki 11:30-39], probably reached the king's ears; and Jeroboam became a marked man [1Ki 11:40]. His aspiring ambition, impatient for the death of Solomon, led him to form plots and conspiracies, in consequence of which he was compelled to flee to Egypt. Though chosen of God, he would not wait the course of God's providence, and therefore incurred the penalty of death by his criminal rebellion. The heavy exactions and compulsory labor (1Ki 11:28) which Solomon latterly imposed upon his subjects, when his foreign resources began to fail, had prepared the greater part of the kingdom for a revolt under so popular a demagogue as Jeroboam.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They have forsaken me, </span> i.e. the king, and his concubines, and people, who easily followed his example, but were not at all excused by it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Because that they have forsaken me,....

It is not on account of this rebellion, which was quickly suppressed by Solomon, but on account of the later enterprise of Jeroboam, that his personal history is so minutely detailed. Jeroboam was an Ephraimite (&#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>) of Zereda, i.e., Zarthan, in the Jordan valley (see <a href="/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a>), son of a widow, and &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, i.e., not a subject (Then.), but an officer, of Solomon. All that is related of his rebellion against the king is the circumstances under which it took place. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1491;, this is how it stands with, as in <a href="/joshua/5-4.htm">Joshua 5:4</a>. Solomon built Millo (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), and closed the rent (the defile?) in the city of David. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1509;, ruptura, cannot be a rent or breach in the wall of the city of David, inasmuch as &#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; is not added, and since the fortification of the city by David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>) no hostile attack had ever been made upon Jerusalem; but in all probability it denotes the ravine which separated Zion from Moriah and Ophel, the future Tyropoeon, through the closing of which the temple mountain was brought within the city wall, and the fortification of the city of David was completed (Thenius, Ewald, Gesch. iii. p. 330). Compare &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1509;, a gap in the coast, a bay. On the occasion of this building, Jeroboam proved himself a &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, i.e., a very able and energetic man; so that when Solomon saw the young man, that he was doing work, i.e., urging it forward, he committed to him the oversight over all the heavy work of the house of Joseph. It must have been while occupying this post that he attempted a rebellion against Solomon. This is indicated by &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;&#1491; in v. 27. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>, the reason for the rebellion is to be sought for in the appointment of the Ephraimites to heavy works. This awakened afresh the old antipathy of that tribe to Judah, and Jeroboam availed himself of this to instigate a rebellion.</body></html>
