But from <a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm" title="And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.">1Kings 11:26</a> it may be inferred that Jeroboam, characteristically enough, had not patience to wait for its fulfilment, and that he sought in some way by overt act to clutch, or prepare to clutch, at royalty. The addition to the LXX. describes him, before his flight into Egypt, as collecting three hundred chariots, and assuming royal pretensions, taking advantage of his presidency over “the house of Joseph.”<p><span class= "bld">Shishak king of Egypt.</span>—The Shishak of the Old Testament is certainly to be identified with the <span class= "ital">Sheshenk</span> of the Egyptian monuments, the <span class= "ital">Sesonchis</span> or <span class= "ital">Sesonchosis</span> of the Greek historians; and the identification is an important point in the Biblical chronology, for the accession of Sheshenk is fixed by the Egyptian traditions at about B.C. 980. It is a curious proof of historical accuracy that the generic name Pharaoh is not given to Shishak here. For it appears that he was not of the old royal line, but the founder of a new dynasty (the 23rd), called the Bubastite dynasty, in which several names are believed to have a Semitic origin, arguing foreign extraction; and in one genealogical table his ancestors appear not to have been of royal rank. It seems that he united (perhaps by marriage) the lines of the two dynasties which previously ruled feebly in Upper and Lower Egypt, and so inaugurated a new era of prosperity and conquest. His invasion of Judah in the fifth year of Rehoboam (see <a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:">1Kings 14:25</a>) is chronicled in the monuments as belonging to the twentieth year of his own reign. He was, therefore, king for the last fifteen years of Solomon’s reign; and his favourable reception of the rebel Jeroboam indicates a natural change of attitude towards the Israelite power. The LXX. addition describes Jeroboam (in a passage clearly suggested by what is recorded in <a href="/context/1_kings/11-19.htm" title="And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.">1Kings 11:19-20</a> about Hadad) as receiving from Shishak “Ano, the elder sister of Thekemina (Tahpenes), his queen,” which involves an anachronism, for Tahpenes belonged to an earlier Pharaoh. But the whole history implies a close political alliance of Shishak with Jeroboam, both as an exile and as a king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm" title="Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam.

Or, Jeroboam himself, being puffed up with the expectation of ascending the throne, could not conceal it, nor keep his own counsel, but told the matter to some of his confidants, who spread it abroad.

Had not he taught others, that whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand? Yet he himself thinks to defeat that counsel.

He has been identified with Sesonchosis, who is mentioned by Manetho as the first king of the twenty-second dynasty. He appears to have come to the throne about 988 B. C. i.e. in the 27th year of Solomon, though some calculations place him a little later.

And our translation with its "therefore" favours this view. The Hebrews, however, has simply "<span class="accented">and</span> Solomon sought," etc. And these words connect themselves with ver. 26, "even he lifted up his hand," etc. With ver. 27 a parenthesis begins, explaining how it came about that Jeroboam rebelled. It is implied distinctly that it was because of Ahijah's prophecy. That prophecy, however, was in no sense a justification of treason or attack on Jeroboam's part. The fact that God had revealed His purposes was no reason why Jeroboam should forestall them. David knew and others knew that he was destined to be king, but he piously left it for God, in His own time and way, to place him on the throne. And Jeroboam's rebellion is the more inexcusable, because  Ahijah had expressly stated that Solomon was to retain the kingdom during his lifetime. However "he lifted up his hand;" there was some overt act of rebellion, and Solomon, because of this, and not because of the prophecy (of which, indeed, he may never have heard), sought to slay him. Nor was the king without justification in so doing. Treason must be promptly suppressed, and treason against a benefactor (see ver. 28) is doubly hateful.] <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt</span> [cf. verse 17, and <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>.

For the whole of the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a> forms part of the explanation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; which commences with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>, so that &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; is closely connected with &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>, and there is no such gap in the history as is supposed by Thenius, who builds upon this opinion most untenable conjectures as to the intertwining of different sources. At that time, as Jeroboam was one day going out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah of Shilo (Seilun) met him by the way (&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;), with a new upper garment wrapped around him; and when they were alone, he rent the new garment, that is to say, his own, not Jeroboam's, as Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 388) erroneously supposes, into twelve pieces, and said to Jeroboam, "Take thee ten pieces, for Jehovah saith, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and give thee ten tribes; and one tribe shall remain to him (Solomon) for David's sake," etc. The new &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; wen ehT . was probably only a large four-cornered cloth, which was thrown over the shoulders like the Heik of the Arabs, and enveloped the whole of the upper portion of the body (see my bibl. Archol. ii. pp. 36, 37). By the tearing of the new garment into twelve pieces, of which Jeroboam was to take ten for himself, the prophetic announcement was symbolized in a very emphatic manner. This symbolical action made the promise a completed fact. "As the garment as torn in pieces and lay before the eyes of Jeroboam, so had the division of the kingdom already taken place in the counsel of God" (O. v. Gerlach). There was something significant also in the circumstance that it was a new garment, which is stated twice, and indicates the newness, i.e., the still young and vigorous condition, of the kingdom (Thenius).<p>In the word of God explaining the action it is striking that Jeroboam was to receive ten tribes, and the one tribe was to remain to Solomon (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-32.htm">1 Kings 11:32</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-35.htm">1 Kings 11:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>, as in <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). The nation consisted of twelve tribes, and Ahijah had torn his garment into twelve pieces, of which Jeroboam was to take ten; so that there were two remaining. It is evident at once from this, that the numbers are intended to be understood symbolically and not arithmetically. Ten as the number of completeness and totality is placed in contrast with one, to indicate that all Israel was to be torn away from the house of David, as is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>, "they made Jeroboam king over all Israel," and only one single fragment was to be left to the house of Solomon out of divine compassion. This one tribe, however, is not Benjamin, the one tribe beside Judah, as Hupfeld (on <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>), C. a Lap., Mich., and others suppose, but, according to the distinct statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-20.htm">1 Kings 12:20</a>, "the tribe of Judah only." Nevertheless Benjamin belonged to Judah; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-21.htm">1 Kings 12:21</a>, Rehoboam gathered together the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin to fight against the house of Israel (which had fallen away), and to bring the kingdom again to himself. And so also in <a href="/2_chronicles/11-3.htm">2 Chronicles 11:3</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a> Judah and Benjamin are reckoned as belonging to the kingdom of Rehoboam. This distinct prominence given to Benjamin by the side of Judah overthrows the explanation suggested by Seb. Schmidt and others, namely, that the description of the portion left to Rehoboam as one tribe is to be explained from the fact that Judah and Benjamin, on the border of which Jerusalem was situated, were regarded in a certain sense as one, and that the little Benjamin was hardly taken into consideration at all by the side of the great Judah. For if Ahijah had regarded Benjamin as one with Judah, he would not have torn his garment into twelve pieces, inasmuch as if Benjamin was to be merged in Judah, or was not to be counted along with it as a distinct tribe, the whole nation could only be reckoned as eleven tribes. Moreover the twelve tribes did not so divide themselves, that Jeroboam really received ten tribes and Rehoboam only one or only two. In reality there were three tribes that fell to the kingdom of Judah, and only nine to the kingdom of Israel, Ephraim and Manasseh being reckoned as two tribes, since the tribe of Levi was not counted in the political classification. The kingdom of Judah included, beside the tribe of Judah, both the tribe of Benjamin and also the tribe of Simeon, the territory of which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>, was within the tribe-territory of Judah and completely surrounded by it, so that the Simeonites would have been obliged to emigrate and give up their tribe-land altogether, if they desired to attach themselves to the kingdom of Israel. But it cannot be inferred from <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a> that an emigration of the whole tribe had taken place (see also at <a href="/1_kings/12-17.htm">1 Kings 12:17</a>). On the other hand, whilst the northern border of the tribe of Benjamin, with the cities of Bethel, Ramah, and Jericho, fell to the kingdom of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a>, <a href="/1_kings/15-21.htm">1 Kings 15:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>), several of the cities of the tribe of Dan were included in the kingdom of Judah, namely, Ziklag, which Achish had presented to David, and also Zorea and Ajalon (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>), in which Judah obtained compensation for the cities of Benjamin of which it had been deprived.<p>(Note: On the other hand, the fact that in <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a> Benjamin is placed between Ephraim and Manasseh is no proof that it belonged to the kingdom of Israel; for can this be inferred from the fact that Benjamin, as the tribe to which Saul belonged, at the earlier split among the tribes took the side of those which were opposed to David, and that at a still later period a rebellion originated with Benjamin. For in <a href="/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a> the exposition is disputed, and the jealousy of Benjamin towards Judah appears to have become extinct with the dying out of the royal house of Saul. Again, the explanation suggested by Oehler (Herzog's Cycl.) of the repeated statement that the house of David was to receive only one tribe, namely, that there was not a single whole tribe belonging to the southern kingdom beside Judah, is by no means satisfactory. For it cannot be proved that any portion of the tribe of Simeon ever belonged to the kingdom of Israel, although the number ten was not complete without it. And it cannot be inferred from <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> that Simeonites had settled outside their tribe-territory. And, as a rule, single families or households that may have emigrated cannot be taken into consideration as having any bearing upon the question before us, since, according to the very same passage of the Chronicles, many members of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh had emigrated to the kingdom of Judah.)<p>Consequently there only remained nine tribes for the northern kingdom. For &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; see at <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>. For <a href="/1_kings/11-33.htm">1 Kings 11:33</a> compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>. The plurals &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; are not open to critical objection, but are used in accordance with the fact, since Solomon did not practise idolatry alone, but many in the nation forsook the Lord along with him. &#1510;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, with a Chaldaic ending (see Ges. 87, 1, a.). In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm">1 Kings 11:34-36</a> there follows a more precise explanation: Solomon himself is not to lose the kingdom, but to remain prince all his life, and his son is to retain one tribe; both out of regard to David (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-12.htm">1 Kings 11:12</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "but I will set him for prince," inasmuch as leaving him upon the throne was not merely a divine permission, but a divine act. "That there may be a light to my servant David always before me in Jerusalem." This phrase, which is repeated in <a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a>, is to be explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>, where David's regal rule is called the light which God's grace had kindled for Israel, and affirms that David was never to want a successor upon the throne.</body></html>
