And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.">2Samuel 15:16</a>), marking perhaps the characteristic temperament of voluptuousness, which seduced him into his great sin; but it was carried out by Solomon on a scale corresponding to the magnificence of his kingdom, and probably had in his case the political object of alliance with neighbouring or tributary kings. We find it inherited by Rehoboam (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/11-18.htm" title="And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;">2Chronicles 11:18-21</a>), and it probably became in different degrees the practice of succeeding kings. Hitherto, while polygamy, as everywhere in the East, had to some degree existed in Israel from patriarchal times, yet it must have been checked by the marriage regulations of the Law. Nor had there yet been the royal magnificence and wealth, under which alone it attains to full development. We have some traces of it in the households of some of the Judges: Gideon (<a href="/judges/8-30.htm" title="And Gideon had three score and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.">Judges 8:30</a>), Jair (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>), Ibzan and Abdon (<a href="/judges/12-9.htm" title="And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.">Judges 12:9</a>; <a href="/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>). Now, however, it became, in spite of the prohibition of the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), a recognised element of royal self-indulgence—such as is described in <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm" title="I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:">Ecclesiastes 2:7-8</a>, and is perhaps traceable even through the beauty of the Song of Solomon. In itself, even without any incidental consequences, it must necessarily be a demoralising power, as sinning against the primeval ordinance of God, and robbing natural relations of their true purity and sacredness. But in actual fact it sinned still more by involving forbidden marriages with idolatrous races, with the often-predicted effect of declension into idolatry.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, Hittites.</span>—The first three of these races were kindred to Israel and of the stock of Abraham, and were now among the subjects of Solomon; the last two were of the old Canaanitish stock, and were now inferior allies. To the last alone properly attached the prohibition of the Law (<a href="/context/exodus/34-12.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the middle of you:">Exodus 34:12-16</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/7-3.htm" title="Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>); but the reason on which that prohibition was grounded was now equally applicable to the others; for they also had fallen into the worship of false gods. Hence the extension of it to them, recognised by the Jews after the captivity (<a href="/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>; <a href="/context/ezra/9-11.htm" title="Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.">Ezra 9:11-12</a>; <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:">Nehemiah 13:23-29</a>).<p>It is to be noted that the marriage with the daughter of Pharaoh is apparently distinguished from these connections, which are so greatly censured, and that there is no mention of the introduction of any Egyptian idolatry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1 Kings 11:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">King Solomon loved many strange women — </span>It was not a fault in him that he married Pharaoh’s daughter; she being a proselyte, as is generally supposed, to the Jewish religion.

Nothing forms in itself a security against the deceitfulness and depravity of the human heart. Nor will old age cure the heart of any evil propensity. If our sinful passions are not crucified and mortified by the grace of God, they never will die of themselves, but will last even when opportunities to gratify them are taken away. Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. We see how weak we are of ourselves, without the grace of God; let us therefore live in constant dependence on that grace. Let us watch and be sober: ours is a dangerous warfare, and in an enemy's country, while our worst foes are the traitors in our own hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In noticing successively Solomon's excessive accumulation of silver and gold <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-25</a>, his multiplication of horses <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>, and his multiplication of wives, the writer has in mind the warning of Moses against these three forms of princely ostentation, all alike forbidden to an Israelite monarch (marginal reference).<p>Zidonians - i. e., Phoenician women.

Solomon's Wives and Concubines in His Old Age.<p>1, 2. But King Solomon loved many strange women&#8212;Solomon's extraordinary gift of wisdom was not sufficient to preserve him from falling into grievous and fatal errors. A fairer promise of true greatness, a more beautiful picture of juvenile piety, never was seen than that which he exhibited at the commencement of his reign. No sadder, more humiliating, or awful spectacle can be imagined than the besotted apostasy of his old age; and to him may be applied the words of Paul (Ga 3:3), of John (Re 3:17), and of Isaiah (Isa 14:21). A love of the world, a ceaseless round of pleasure, had insensibly corrupted his heart, and produced, for a while at least, a state of mental darkness. The grace of God deserted him; and the son of the pious David&#8212;the religiously trained child of Bath-sheba (Pr 31:1-3), and pupil of Nathan, instead of showing the stability of sound principle and mature experience became at last an old and foolish king (Ec 4:13). His fall is traced to his "love of many strange women." Polygamy was tolerated among the ancient Hebrews; and, although in most countries of the East, the generality of men, from convenience and economy, confine themselves to one woman, yet a number of wives is reckoned as an indication of wealth and importance, just as a numerous stud of horses and a grand equipage are among us. The sovereign, of course, wishes to have a more numerous harem than any of his subjects; and the female establishments of many Oriental princes have, both in ancient and modern times, equalled or exceeded that of Solomon's. It is probable, therefore, that, in conformity with Oriental notions, he resorted to it as a piece of state magnificence. But in him it was unpardonable, as it was a direct and outrageous violation of the divine law (De 17:17), and the very result which that statute was ordained to prevent was realized in him. His marriage with the daughter of Pharaoh is not censured either here or elsewhere (see on [311]1Ki 3:1). It was only his love for many strange women; for women, though in the East considered inferiors, exert often a silent but powerful seductive influence over their husbands in the harem, as elsewhere, and so it was exemplified in Solomon.Solomon’s wives and concubines, which in his old age seduce him to idolatry, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:...">1 Kings 11:1-8</a></span>.

At the same time a large harem was an element in Oriental pomp. Most of these women were heathen, and their worship would be practised in the harem. In all the nations of antiquity women had special religious observances which they practised without the assistance of the priests. But Solomon built temples for foreign worship. It seems from <a href="/1_kings/11-8.htm" title="And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.">1 Kings 11:8</a> that these were for the women. If this were so they must have come, under attendance no doubt, from the harem to the Temple. In taking Pharaoh’s daughter Solomon had joined to him a mighty but somewhat distant monarch. The other nations mentioned in this verse were close at hand. Edom bordered on the south of Palestine, Moab and Ammon were on the east, and Sidon and the Hittite kingdom on the north. The LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat</span>.) adds Syrian and Amorite wives to the number, and incorporates part of <a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm" title="And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.">1 Kings 11:3</a> with this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of this part of Solomon’s conduct and character no mention is made in the books of the Chronicles.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And</span>.
