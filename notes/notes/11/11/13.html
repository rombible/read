Though we have reason to hope that he repented, and found mercy, yet the Holy Ghost did not expressly record it, but left it doubtful, as a warning to others not to sin. The guilt may be taken away, but not the reproach; that will remain.

Benjamin which went with Judah was so small as to be hardly worth accounting of, and Simeon was also absorbed in Judah.

The city of the Jebusite, which David conquered, and all the ground north of the valley of Hinnom was in the tribe of Benjamin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for Jerusalem’s sake, which I have chosen</span>] In <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm" title="But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:">Deuteronomy 12:5</a> it is signified that God will choose some place out of all the tribes ‘to place His name there,’ and in <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm" title="And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.

SOLOMON'S ADVERSARIES. - As the historian has collected together in chs. 6, 7, 8. all the information he can convey respecting the <span class="accented">temple</span>, and in chs. 9, 10. all the scattered notices respecting Solomon's <span class="accented">power</span> and <span class="accented">greatness</span>, so here he arranges in one section the history of Solomon's <span class="accented">adversaries</span>. It must not be supposed that the following records stand in due chronological order. The enmities here mentioned did not date from the delivery of the message of which we have just heard; on the contrary, the hatred and opposition of Hadad and Rezon began at an early period, though not the earliest (<a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a>), of Solomon's reign. It was only in his later life, however, that they materially affected his position and rule; hence it is that they are brought before us at this stage of the history, and also because they are manifestly regarded as chastisements for Solomon's sin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He walked after the Ashtaroth, etc. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>, the idolatry here condemned consisted in the fact that he built altars to the deities of all his foreign wives, upon which they offered incense and sacrifice to their idols. It is not stated that he himself also offered sacrifice to these idols. But even the building of altars for idols was a participation in idolatry which was irreconcilable with true fidelity to the Lord. &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, Astarte, was the chief female deity of all the Canaanitish tribes; her worship was also transplanted from Tyre to Carthage, where it flourished greatly.

Milcom was at any rate related to the Chemosh of the Moabites mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; for Chemosh is also described as a god of the Ammonites in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>, whereas everywhere else he is called the god of the Moabites (<a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, etc.). Chemosh was a sun-god, who was worshipped as king of his people and as a god of war, and as such is depicted upon coins with a sword, lance, and shield in his hands, and with two torches by his side (see at <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>). The enumeration of the different idols is incomplete; Chemosh being omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>, and Astarte, to whom Solomon also built an altar in Jerusalem, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>, in <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>.
