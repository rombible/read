It is there closely connected with the great struggle with the Syrians, and the victory is ascribed in one record to Joab, in the other to Abishai. Here David himself is described as taking part in the war—perhaps completing the conquest, as in the war with Ammon, after it had been successfully begun by Joab (<a href="/context/2_samuel/12-26.htm" title="And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.">2Samuel 12:26-31</a>). (Instead of “David was in Edom,” the LXX. and other versions read “David destroyed Edom,” by a slight variation of the Hebrew text.) The war was evidently one of ruthless extermination of “every male,” except those who fled the country, or found refuge in its rocky fastnesses, and was carried on by systematic ravage under the command of Joab. How it was provoked we do not know; for we have no previous notice of Edom since the time of the Exodus, except a reference to war against it in the days of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1Samuel 14:47</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/11-15.htm" title="For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;...">1 Kings 11:15-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">When David was in Edom — </span>By his army to war against it; <span class="ital">and Joab was gone up to bury the slain — </span>The Israelites who were slain in the battle, (<a href="/context/2_samuel/8-13.htm" title="And David got him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men....">2 Samuel 8:13-14</a>,) whom he honourably interred in some certain place, to which he is said to go up for that end.

Solomon's Adversaries.<p>14-25. the Lord stirred up an adversary&#8212;that is, permitted him, through the impulse of his own ambition, or revenge, to attack Israel. During the war of extermination, which Joab carried on in Edom (2Sa 8:13), this Hadad, of the royal family, a mere boy when rescued from the sword of the ruthless conqueror, was carried into Egypt, hospitably entertained, and became allied with the house of the Egyptian king. In after years, the thought of his native land and his lost kingdom taking possession of his mind, he, on learning the death of David and Joab, renounced the ease, possessions, and glory of his Egyptian residence, to return to Edom and attempt the recovery of his ancestral throne. The movements of this prince seem to have given much annoyance to the Hebrew government; but as he was defeated by the numerous and strong garrisons planted throughout the Edomite territory, Hadad seems to have offered his services to Rezon, another of Solomon's adversaries (1Ki 11:23-25). This man, who had been general of Hadadezer and, on the defeat of that great king, had successfully withdrawn a large force, went into the wilderness, led a predatory life, like Jephthah, David, and others, on the borders of the Syrian and Arabian deserts. Then, having acquired great power, he at length became king in Damascus, threw off the yoke, and was "the adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon." He was succeeded by Hadad, whose successors took the official title of Ben-hadad from him, the illustrious founder of the powerful kingdom of Damascene-Syria. These hostile neighbors, who had been long kept in check by the traditional fame of David's victories, took courage; and breaking out towards the latter end of Solomon's reign, they must have not only disturbed his kingdom by their inroads, but greatly crippled his revenue by stopping his lucrative traffic with Tadmor and the Euphrates.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When David was in Edom, </span> to wit, by his army, to war against it.

Bahr refers to <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, and <a href="/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>, but they are not strictly parallel, and it is possible that the text is slightly corrupt, as the LXX., Syr., and Arab. must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> before them "when David <span class="accented">smote</span> Edom."

According to <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>, <span class="accented">Abishai</span> slew 18,000 Edomites, while <a href="/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>.

The emphasis lies upon the fact that God had appeared to him Himself for the purpose of warning him, and had not merely caused him to be warned by prophets, as Theodoret has explained. In consequence of this, the following announcement is made to him, no doubt through the medium of a prophet, possibly Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29</a>): "Because this has come into thy mind, and thou hast not kept my covenant, ... I will tear the kingdom from thee and give it to thy servant; nevertheless I will not do it in thy lifetime for thy father David's sake: howbeit I will not tear away the whole kingdom; one tribe I will give to thy son." In this double limitation of the threatened forfeiture of the kingdom there is clearly manifested the goodness of God (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; - Theodoret); not, however, with reference to Solomon, who had forfeited the divine mercy through his idolatry, but with regard to David and the selection of Jerusalem: that is to say, not from any special preference for David and Jerusalem, but in order that the promise made to David (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>), and the choice of Jerusalem as the place where His name should be revealed which was connected with that promise, might stand immoveably as an act of grace, which no sin of men could overturn (vid., <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).
