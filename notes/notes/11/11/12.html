By the postponement of the chastisement, the blessing promised to his son personally would be still preserved; by the retaining of the kingdom, though shorn of its splendour, and limited to Judah, the larger and more important promise, the continuance of the family of David till the coming of the Messiah, would be fulfilled. The “one tribe” is, of course, Judah, with which Benjamin was indissolubly united by the very position of the capital on its frontier. This is curiously indicated in <a href="/context/1_kings/11-31.htm" title="And he said to Jeroboam, Take you ten pieces: for thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you:">1Kings 11:31-32</a>, where “ten tribes” are given to Jeroboam, and the remainder out of the twelve is still called “one tribe.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:9-13 The Lord told Solomon, it is likely by a prophet, what he must expect for his apostacy.

The guilt may be taken away, but not the reproach; that will remain.

His name occurs frequently on the "Moabite-Stone." Car-Chemish, "the fort of Chemosh," a great city of the northern Hittites, must have been under his protection. In Babylon he seems to have been known as Chomus-belus, or Chemosh-Bel.<p>The hill - Olivet. At present the most southern summit only (the "Mons Offensionis") is pointed out as having been desecrated by the idol sanctuaries: but the early Eastern travelers tell us that in their time the most northern suburb was believed to have been the site of the high p ace of Chemosh, the southern one that of Moloch only. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 11:9-13.

It is not stated that he himself also offered sacrifice to these idols.

Milcom was at any rate related to the Chemosh of the Moabites mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; for Chemosh is also described as a god of the Ammonites in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>, whereas everywhere else he is called the god of the Moabites (<a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, etc.). Chemosh was a sun-god, who was worshipped as king of his people and as a god of war, and as such is depicted upon coins with a sword, lance, and shield in his hands, and with two torches by his side (see at <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>). The enumeration of the different idols is incomplete; Chemosh being omitted in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>, and Astarte, to whom Solomon also built an altar in Jerusalem, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>, in <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>.
