David's family was continued as a lamp in Jerusalem, to maintain the true worship of God there, when the light of Divine truth was extinguished in all other places. The Lord has still taken care of his cause, while those who ought to have been serviceable thereto have lived and perished in their sins. The Son of David will still continue a light to his church, to establish it in truth and righteousness to the end of time. There are two kinds of fulfilling the law, one legal, the other by the gospel. Legal is, when men do all things required in the law, and that by themselves. None ever thus fulfilled the law but Christ, and Adam before his fall. The gospel manner of fulfilling the law is, to believe in Christ who fulfilled the law for us, and to endeavour in the whole man to obey God in all his precepts. And this is accepted of God, as to all those that are in Christ.

The" three years" are not to be interpreted strictly. As he ascended the throne in the eighteenth and died in the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign, he cannot have completed three years. But it does not follow that "he cannot have reigned much more than two years" (Rawlinson, and similarly Keil). He may have reigned all but three] <span class="cmt_word">reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah</span> [in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> called <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, Heb. <span class="accented">Michajahu</span>. That the same person is meant is proved as well by the context as by <a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, where the name is given as here. Keil (cf. Dict. Bib. 2:162) ascribes the discrepancy to an error of the copyist; but the names are so unlike in the original as to discountenance this assumption. I venture to suggest that <span class="accented">Michajahu</span> was the significant form - the word means "Who is like Jehovah?" - which the name Maachah, "oppression," borne by the Geshurite princess who married David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>) assumed when she joined the <span class="accented">Lord's peo</span>ple, and embraced, as no doubt she would <span class="accented">do</span>, the religion of Jehovah. Such a change would be quite in accordance with the genius and traditions of the Semitic races (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5, 15</a>; <a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30</a>. <span class="accented">passim</span>; 32:28; 41:45; <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, etc. Cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4, 6</a>), and there may well have been special reasons in this case, apart from the piety of David, why it should be made. For the name Maachah appears to have been taken Iron the town and district of that name near Geshur - a part of Syria was called <span class="accented">Syria Maachah</span> (<a href="/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-8</a>). In <a href="/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14, 15</a> we read of a district of <span class="accented">Beth Maachah -</span> and it not improbably witnessed to unhappy memories. How natural it would be that David's bride should take a name of better omen and of a religious import, and how natural that the grand-daughter who bore her name should be called by that name in both its forms. Since writing the above, I find that a somewhat similar idea has occurred long since to others. Both Kimchi and Jarchi hold that she had two names. It is supposed by some that she assumed the name <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, as more dignified, on becoming queen. Wordsworth thinks that Michaiah was her real name, and that it was degraded into Maachah when she was deposed for idolatry. This latter view dovetails with the one suggested above. It  would be quite in accordance with Jewish usages and habits of thought that the name which had been changed into <span class="accented">Michaiah</span> when the grandmother became a proselyte, should be changed back into <span class="accented">Maachah</span> when this princess apostatized], <span class="cmt_word">the daughter</span> [rather, grand-daughter. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> includes all female descendants, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (see ver. 10) all anxestresses] <span class="cmt_word">of Abishalom.</span> We can hardly doubt that Absalom, the son of David, is meant here. We have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the express statement of <a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, "Rehoboam loved Maachah, the daughter of <span class="accented">Absalom</span>," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The fact that two of Rehoboam's other wives were of the family of David, which shows that it was part of his policy to marry the daughters of that house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The mother of Absalom was named Maachah (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The name is so uncommon - in fact, it is <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;</span> - that another person can hardly be intended. Moreover the variation in spelling is extremely slight. It has been held, however, that a different person is designated by the name, principally because Absalom had but one daughter whose name was Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>), whereas Abijah's mother is said to have been the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>). But this difficulty admits of an easy solution. Tamar was doubtless married to Uriel, and Maachah was the fruit of this marriage. And with this explanation agrees the account of Josephus (Ant. 8:10,1). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>King Shishak of Egypt invaded the land with a powerful army, conquered all the fortified cities, penetrated to Jerusalem, and would probably have put an end to the kingdom of Judah, if God had not had compassion upon him, and saved him from destruction, in consequence of the humiliation of the king and of the chiefs of the nation, caused by the admonition of the prophet Shemaiah, so that after the conquest of Jerusalem Shishak contented himself with withdrawing, taking with him the treasures of the temple and of the royal palace. Compare the fuller account of this expedition in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-9</a>. Shishak (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;) was the first king of the twenty-second (or Bubastitic) dynasty, called Sesonchis in Jul. Afric., Sesonchosis in Eusebius, and upon the monuments on which Champollion first deciphered his name, Sheshonk or Sheshenk. Shishak has celebrated his expedition against Judah by a bas-relief on the outer wall of the pillar-hall erected by him in the first palace at Karnak, in which more than 130 figures are led in cords by Ammon and the goddess Muth with their hands bound upon their backs. The lower portion of the figures of this long row of prisoners is covered by escutcheons, the border of which being provided with battlements, shows that the prisoners are symbols of conquered cities. About a hundred of these escutcheons are still legible, and in the names upon them a large number of the names of cities in the kingdom of Judah have been deciphered with tolerable certainty.<p>(Note: Compare Max Duncker, Gesch. des Alterthums, Bd. i. p. 909, ed. 3, and for the different copies of this bas-relief in the more recent works upon Egypt, Reutschi in Herzog's Cycl. (art. Rehoboam). The latest attempts at deciphering are those by Brugsch, Geogr. Inschriften in den gypt. Denkmltern, ii. p. 56ff., and O. Blau, Sisaqs Zug gegen Juda aus dem Denkmale bei Karnak erlutert, in the Deutsch. morgenl. Ztschr. xv. p. 233ff. Champollion's interpretation of one of these escutcheons, in his Prcis du systme hierogl. p. 204, viz., Juda hammalek, "the king of Judah," has been rejected by Lepsius and Brugsch as philologically inadmissible. Brugsch writes the name thus: Judh malk or Joud-hamalok, and identifies Judh with Jehudijeh, which Robinson (Pal. iii. p. 45) supposes to be the ancient Jehud (<a href="/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>). This Jehud in the tribe of Dan, Blau (p. 238) therefore also finds in the name; and it will not mislead any one that this city is reckoned as belonging to the tribe of Dan, since in the very same chapter (<a href="/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>) Ajalon is assigned to Dan, though it was nevertheless a fortress of Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>). But Blau has not given any explanation of the addition malk or malok, whereas Gust. Roesch takes it to be &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, and supposes it to mean "Jehud of the king, namely, of Rehoboam or of Judah, on account of its being situated in Dan, which belonged to the northern kingdom." But this is certainly incorrect. For where could the Egyptians have obtained this exact knowledge of the relation in which the tribes of the nation of Israel stood to one another?)<p>Shishak was probably bent chiefly upon the conquest and plundering of the cities. But from Jerusalem, beside other treasures of the temple and palace, he also carried off the golden shields that had been made by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>), in the place of which Rehoboam had copper ones made for his body-guard. The guard, &#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, runners, are still further described as &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "who kept the door of the king's house," i.e., supplied the sentinels for the gate of the royal palace.</body></html>
