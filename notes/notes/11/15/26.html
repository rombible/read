Ungodly men execute the just judgments of God upon each other.

Ijon (&#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;) is to be sought for in all probability in Tell Dibbin, on the eastern border of Merj Ayun; and in Ajun, although Ajun is written with Aleph, the name Ijon is probably preserved, since the situation of this Tell seems thoroughly adapted for a fortress on the northern border of Israel (vid., Robinson, Bibl. Res. p. 375, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 322). Dan is the present Tell el Kadi; see at <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>.
