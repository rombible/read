This alteration in his conduct may probably be explained in part from the fact, that notwithstanding the victory, his army had been considerably weakened by the battle which he fought with the Cushites (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>), although this by no means justified his want of confidence in the power of the Lord, and still less his harsh and unjust treatment of the prophet Hanani, whom he caused to be put in the house of the stocks on account of his condemnation of the confidence which he placed in the Syrians instead of Jehovah (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>).)<p>&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; may be explained from the face that the temple and palace treasures had been plundered by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>); and therefore what Asa had replaced in the temple treasury (<a href="/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>), and had collected together for his palace, was only a remnant in comparison with the former state of these treasures. The name &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1491;, i.e., son of Hadad, the sun-god (according to Macrobius, i. 23; cf., Movers, Phniz. i. p. 196), was borne by three kings of Damascus: the one here named, his son in the time of Ahab (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>, <a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>), and the son of Hazael (<a href="/2_kings/13-24.htm">2 Kings 13:24</a>). The first was a son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezyon. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, his father Tabrimmon (good is Rimmon; see at <a href="/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>) had also been king, and was the contemporary of Abijam. But that his grandfather Hezyon was also king, and the same person as the Rezon mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>, cannot be shown to be even probable, since there is no ground for the assumption that Hezyon also bore the name Rezon, and is called by the latter name here and by the former in <a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>.</body></html>
