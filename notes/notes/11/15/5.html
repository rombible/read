David's family was continued as a lamp in Jerusalem, to maintain the true worship of God there, when the light of Divine truth was extinguished in all other places. The Lord has still taken care of his cause, while those who ought to have been serviceable thereto have lived and perished in their sins. The Son of David will still continue a light to his church, to establish it in truth and righteousness to the end of time. There are two kinds of fulfilling the law, one legal, the other by the gospel. Legal is, when men do all things required in the law, and that by themselves. None ever thus fulfilled the law but Christ, and Adam before his fall. The gospel manner of fulfilling the law is, to believe in Christ who fulfilled the law for us, and to endeavour in the whole man to obey God in all his precepts. And this is accepted of God, as to all those that are in Christ. Thus David and others are said to fulfil the law.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To set up his son - The idolatry of Abijam deserved the same punishment as that of Jeroboam <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-14</a>, of Baasha <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-2.htm">1 Kings 16:2-4</a>, or of Zimri <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-19.htm">1 Kings 16:19</a>, the cutting off of his seed, and the transfer of the crown to another family. That these consequences did not follow in the kingdom of Judah, was owing to the "faithfulness" of David (see the marginal reference), which brought a blessing on his posterity. Few things are more remarkable and more difficult to account for on mere grounds of human reason, than the stability of the succession in Judah, and its excessive instability in the sister kingdom. One family in Judah holds the throne from first to last, during a space but little short of four centuries, while in Israel there are nine changes of dynasty within two hundred and fifty years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp&#8212;"A lamp" in one's house is an Oriental phrase for continuance of family name and prosperity. Abijam was not rejected only in consequence of the divine promise to David (see on [314]1Ki 11:13-36).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Quest.</span> How is this true, seeing David sinned in the matter of Nabal, <span class="bld"> 1Sa 25</span>, and Achish, <span class="bld"> 1Sa 27</span>, and Mephibosheth, and his indulgence to his children, Adonijah, Amnon, and Absalom, and in the numbering of the people? Answ. This and the like phrases are not to be understood as exclusive of every sinful action, but only of a sinful course or state, or of an habitual and continued apostacy from God, or from his ways, as the very phrase of turning aside from God, or from his commands, doth constantly imply, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/32-8.htm" title="They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:8</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence; for your people which you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.">Deu 9:12</a>,16 <a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm" title="And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.">1 Samuel 8:3</a> <a href="/psalms/78-57.htm" title="But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.">Psalm 78:57</a> <a href="/isaiah/44-20.htm" title="He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?">Isaiah 44:20</a> <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm" title="From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain jangling;">1 Timothy 1:6</a> 5:15</span>, &c. And thus it is most true. For David’s other sins were either sudden and transient acts, proceeding from human infirmity, and extraordinary temptations, and soon repented of and blotted out, as in the cases of Nabal and Achish; or mistakes of his judgment, which was not fully convinced of the sinfulness of such actions, as in the other cases alleged; whereas that which concerned Uriah’s wife was a designed and studied sin, long continued in, defended with a succession of other sins, presumptuous, and scandalous to his government and to the true religion, which he so eminently professed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,....
