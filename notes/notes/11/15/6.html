David's family was continued as a lamp in Jerusalem, to maintain the true worship of God there, when the light of Divine truth was extinguished in all other places. The Lord has still taken care of his cause, while those who ought to have been serviceable thereto have lived and perished in their sins. The Son of David will still continue a light to his church, to establish it in truth and righteousness to the end of time. There are two kinds of fulfilling the law, one legal, the other by the gospel. Legal is, when men do all things required in the law, and that by themselves. None ever thus fulfilled the law but Christ, and Adam before his fall. The gospel manner of fulfilling the law is, to believe in Christ who fulfilled the law for us, and to endeavour in the whole man to obey God in all his precepts. And this is accepted of God, as to all those that are in Christ. Thus David and others are said to fulfil the law.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The writer repeats what he had said in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm">1 Kings 14:30</a>, in order to remind the reader that Abijam inherited this war from his father. Abijam's war is described in marginal reference That the author of Kings gives none of its details is agreeable to his common practice in mere military matters. Thus he gives no details of Shishak's expedition, and omits Zerah's expedition altogether. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp&#8212;"A lamp" in one's house is an Oriental phrase for continuance of family name and prosperity.

Abijam continued the war which Rehoboam had begun, and pushed it on to a decisive battle. But the place may be thus rendered, Yet there was war, &c., i.e. although God was pleased to show so much respect to David, as for his sake to continue the succession to the kingdom in his posterity, yet he thought fit to manifest his displeasure against David’s successors for their sins, and to mix their honour and happiness with wars and troubles. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.

Thenius thinks the insertion of the words were due to the carelessness of some copyist, and Bahr admits that our present text is possibly not the original one. For <span class="accented">Rehoboam</span>, some MSS., with the Syriac and Arabic, read <span class="accented">Abijah</span>, but this is clearly an emendation, which in turn begets another repetition (ver. 7), and there is really no need either to alter or suspect the text. Such repetitions are quite in accordance with Eastern usage, and Rehoboam here stands for the house of Rehoboam, or the cause and kingdom which Rehoboam represented. The object of mentioning his name can hardly be "to remind the reader that Abijam inherited this war from his father" (Rawlinson), for it was only on Rehoboam's death that the slumbering hostility blazed out into actual war. That there was warfare between Abi-jam and Jeroboam we know not only from ver. 7, but from <a href="/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3-20</a> also. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Death and burial of Rehoboam: as in the case of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>).

The son and successor of Rehoboam upon the throne is called Abijam (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;) in the account before us; whereas in the Chronicles he is always called Abijah (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;,   <a href="/2_chronicles/12-16.htm">2 Chronicles 12:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-1.htm">2 Chronicles 13:1</a>, etc., or &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/2_chronicles/13-21.htm">2 Chronicles 13:21</a>). &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, i.e., father of the sea, is unquestionably the older form of the name, which was reduced to &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, and then identified with the formation from &#1488;&#1489;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1492;  equals  &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (from &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;). </body></html>
