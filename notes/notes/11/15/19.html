That is right indeed which is so in God's eyes. Asa's times were times of reformation. He removed that which was evil; there reformation begins, and a great deal he found to do. When Asa found idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence. Reformation must begin at home. Asa honours and respects his mother; he loves her well, but he loves God better. Those that have power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well; not only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and our all to God's honour and glory. Asa was cordially devoted to the service of God, his sins not arising from presumption. But his league with Benhadad arose from unbelief. Even true believers find it hard, in times of urgent danger, to trust in the Lord with all their heart. Unbelief makes way for carnal policy, and thus for one sin after another. Unbelief has often led Christians to call in the help of the Lord's enemies in their contests with their brethren; and some who once shone brightly, have thus been covered with a dark cloud towards the end of their days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, "Let there be a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-20. Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the &#8230; house of the Lord&#8212;Asa's religious character is now seen to decline. He trusted not in the Lord (2Ch 16:7). In this emergency Asa solicited the powerful aid of the king of Damascene-Syria; and to bribe him to break off his alliance with Baasha, he transmitted to him the treasure lying in the temple and palace. The Syrian mercenaries were gained. Instances are to be found, both in the ancient and modern history of the East, of the violation of treaties equally sudden and unscrupulous, through the presentation of some tempting bribe. Ben-hadad poured an army into the northern provinces of Israel, and having captured some cities in Galilee, on the borders of Syria, compelled Baasha to withdraw from Ramah back within his own territories.<p>Ben-hadad&#8212;(See on [315]1Ki 11:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father; </span> whereby it appears, that albeit he was an adversary to Israel all Solomon’s days, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm" title="And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.">1 Kings 11:25</a></span>, yet after the division of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah he was in league with both of them; either because his designs lay upon the enlargement of his empire other ways; or rather, because he thought it his wisdom and interest to leave them to themselves, to undo one another by their intestine wars, and so to prepare the way to his conquest of both; whereas his invading of either of them might have made up the breach, and forced them to unite against their common enemy.

There is <span class="ital">a league</span>] There is, as the italics of A. V. shew, no verb expressed in the original. The LXX. supplies the imperative <span class="greekheb">διάθου</span> = make. This the R.V. represents on the margin by ‘Let there be.’ But the concluding words of the clause seem to point to the indicative as the more suitable insertion. What Asa desires to claim is a sort of hereditary alliance, which he would best do by treating the friendship as existing and of long standing.

It is so in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-16.htm">Deuteronomy 29:16</a>. &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1510;&#1514;, formido, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1509;, terrere, timere, hence an idol as an object of fear, and not pudendum, a shameful image, as Movers (Phniz. i. p. 571), who follows the Rabbins, explains it, understanding thereby a Phallus as a symbol of the generative and fructifying power of nature. With regard to the character of this idol, nothing further can be determined than that it was of wood, and possibly a wooden column like the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (see at <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>). "But the high places departed not," i.e., were not abolished. By the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; we are not to understand, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-12.htm">1 Kings 15:12</a>, altars of high places dedicated to idols, but unlawful altars to Jehovah. It is so in the other passages in which this formula recurs (<a href="/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-4.htm">2 Kings 12:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>; and the parallel passages <a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>). The apparent discrepancy between the last-mentioned passages and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-4.htm">2 Chronicles 14:4</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>, may be solved very simply on the supposition that the kings (Asa and Jehoshaphat) did indeed abolish the altars on the high places, but did not carry their reforms in the nation thoroughly out; and not by distinguishing between the bamoth dedicated to Jehovah and those dedicated to idols, as Thenius, Bertheau, and Caspari, with many of the earlier commentators, suppose. For although <a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2</a> is very favourable to this solution, since both &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512; dna &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; are mentioned there, it does not accord with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>, where &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; cannot be merely idolatrous altars dedicated to the Canaanitish Baal, but unquestionably refer to the unlawful altars of Jehovah, or at any rate include them. Moreover, the next clause in the passage before us, "nevertheless Asa's heart was wholly given to the Lord," shows that the expression &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; nois does not mean that the king allowed the unlawful Jehovah-bamoth to remain, but simply that, notwithstanding his fidelity to Jehovah, the bamoth did not depart, so that he was unable to carry the abolition of them thoroughly out.</body></html>
