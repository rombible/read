In virtue of the continuity of human history, the Divine law always ordains that, in respect of consequences, the good deeds as well as the sins of fathers are “visited on their children.”<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm" title="Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:">1 Kings 15:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the Lord gave him a lamp — </span>A son and successor, to perpetuate his name and memory, which otherwise had gone into obscurity. <span class="ital">Jerusalem — </span>That he might maintain that city, and temple, and worship, as a witness for himself in the world, against the Israelites and heathen world.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 Abijam's heart was not perfect with the Lord his God; he wanted sincerity; he began well, but he fell off, and walked in all the sins of his father, following his bad example, though he had seen the bad consequences of it. David's family was continued as a lamp in Jerusalem, to maintain the true worship of God there, when the light of Divine truth was extinguished in all other places. The Lord has still taken care of his cause, while those who ought to have been serviceable thereto have lived and perished in their sins. The Son of David will still continue a light to his church, to establish it in truth and righteousness to the end of time. There are two kinds of fulfilling the law, one legal, the other by the gospel. Legal is, when men do all things required in the law, and that by themselves. None ever thus fulfilled the law but Christ, and Adam before his fall. The gospel manner of fulfilling the law is, to believe in Christ who fulfilled the law for us, and to endeavour in the whole man to obey God in all his precepts. And this is accepted of God, as to all those that are in Christ. Thus David and others are said to fulfil the law.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To set up his son - The idolatry of Abijam deserved the same punishment as that of Jeroboam <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-14</a>, of Baasha <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-2.htm">1 Kings 16:2-4</a>, or of Zimri <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-19.htm">1 Kings 16:19</a>, the cutting off of his seed, and the transfer of the crown to another family. That these consequences did not follow in the kingdom of Judah, was owing to the "faithfulness" of David (see the marginal reference), which brought a blessing on his posterity. Few things are more remarkable and more difficult to account for on mere grounds of human reason, than the stability of the succession in Judah, and its excessive instability in the sister kingdom. One family in Judah holds the throne from first to last, during a space but little short of four centuries, while in Israel there are nine changes of dynasty within two hundred and fifty years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp&#8212;"A lamp" in one's house is an Oriental phrase for continuance of family name and prosperity.

The stability of the family of David on the throne for nearly 400 years, amid all the changes and chances of that period, and whilst in Israel there were "nine changes of dynasty within 250 years" is, as Rawlinson remarks, very "difficult to account for on mere grounds of human reason"]: <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Further particulars are given in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11.htm">2 Chronicles 11</a> and 12 concerning the rest of the acts of Rehoboam.
