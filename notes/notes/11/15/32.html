Observe the ruin of the family of Jeroboam; no word of God shall fall to the ground. Divine threatenings are not designed merely to terrify. Ungodly men execute the just judgments of God upon each other. But in the midst of dreadful sins and this apparent confusion, the Lord carries on his own plan: when it is fully completed, the glorious justice, wisdom, truth, and mercy therein displayed, shall be admired and adored through all the ages of eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An exact repetition of <a href="/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16</a>.

When Nadab in the second year of his reign besieged Gibbethon, which the Philistines and occupied, Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house, I the family or tribe, of Issachar, conspired against him and slew him, and after he became king exterminated the whole house of Jeroboam, without leaving a single soul, whereby the prediction of the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>.) was fulfilled. Gibbethon, which was allotted to the Danites (<a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>), has not yet been discovered. It probably stood close to the Philistian border, and was taken by the Philistines, from whom the Israelites attempted to wrest it by siege under both Nadab and Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16-16.htm">1 Kings 16:16</a>), though apparently without success. &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; as in <a href="/joshua/11-14.htm">Joshua 11:14</a> (see the Comm. on <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16</a>).</body></html>
