Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution.

But in the temple there were separate vessels provided for these offices. (See on [297]2Ch 4:6). The molten sea was an immense semicircular vase, measuring seventeen and a half feet in diameter, and being eight and three-fourths feet in depth. This, at three and a half inches in thickness, could not weigh less than from twenty-five to thirty tons in one solid casting&#8212;and held from sixteen thousand to twenty thousand gallons of water. [See on [298]2Ch 4:3.] The brim was all carved with lily work or flowers; and oxen were carved or cut on the outside all round, to the number of three hundred; and it stood on a pedestal of twelve oxen. These oxen must have been of considerable size, like the Assyrian bulls, so that their corresponding legs would give thickness or strength to support so great a weight for, when the vessel was filled with water, the whole weight would be about one hundred tons [Napier].

This is not only required by the sense, but sustained by a comparison with <a href="/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a>. The relation between the two rows of pomegranates and the plaited work is indeed not precisely defined; but it is generally and correctly assumed, that one row ran round the pillars below the plaited work and the other above, so that the plaited work, which was formed of seven cords plaited together in the form of festoons, was enclosed above and below by the rows of pomegranates. If we compare with this the further statements in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-42.htm">1 Kings 7:42</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/3-16.htm">2 Chronicles 3:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12-13</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>, &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514; is there more precisely designated &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, "bowls of the capitals," from which it is evident that the lower portion of the capitals, to which the braided work was fastened, was rounded in the form of a pitcher or caldron. the number of the pomegranates on the two festoons is given at 400, so that there were 200 on each capital, and consequently each row contained 100 (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-16.htm">2 Chronicles 3:16</a>); and according to Jer. (l.c.) there were 96 &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, "windwards," and in all 100 on the braided work round about. &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;, "windwards," can hardly be taken in any other sense than this: in the direction of the wine, i.e., facing the four quarters of the heavens. This meaning is indisputably sustained by the use of the word &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, to denote the quarters of the heavens, in statements of the aspect of buildings (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-18</a>), whereas there is no foundation whatever for such meanings as "airwards  equals  uncovered" (Bttcher, Thenius), or hanging freely (Ewald).<p>(Note: It is hardly necessary to observe, that the expression &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, to gasp for air, in <a href="/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-6.htm">Jeremiah 14:6</a>, does not warrant our giving to &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; the meaning open or uncovered, as Bttcher supposes. But when Thenius follows Bttcher (Proben, p. 335) in adducing in support of this the fact "that the tangent, which is drawn to any circle divided into a hundred parts, covers exactly four of these parts," the fact rests upon a simple error, inasmuch as any drawing will show that a tangent only touches one point of a circle divided into a hundred parts. And the remark of Bttcher, "If you describe on the outside of a circle of twelve cubits in circumference a hundred small circles of twelve-hundredths of a cubit in diameter, a tangent drawn thereupon will cover to the eye exactly four small circles, although mathematically it touches only one of them in one point," is not correct according to any measurement. For if the tangent touches one of these smaller circles with mathematical exactness, to the eye there will be covered either three or five half circles, or even seven, but never four.)</body></html>
