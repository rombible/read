The latter supposition is, however, far more probable, both because it seems most unlikely that the old sacred candlestick should have been disused, and because in the second Temple only the one seven-lighted candlestick was provided, and (as the sculpture on the Arch of Titus shows) was carried in the Roman triumph after the destruction of the city. (In <a href="/2_chronicles/4-8.htm" title="He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basins of gold.">2Chronicles 4:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-19.htm" title="And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables where on the show bread was set;">2Chronicles 4:19</a>, there is a mention of ten tables for shewbread, similarly ranged on each side of the Holy Place, probably in the same way, additional to the one proper table.) Josephus, in his rhetorical exaggeration, declares that Solomon made ten thousand candlesticks and ten thousand tables; but he distinguishes the one proper candlestick and table from the rest. The candlestick is elaborately described in the history of the construction of the Tabernacle, as of great costliness of material and workmanship. Placed in the Holy Place, opposite to the table of shewbread, and fed carefully with the sacred oil, it appears to have symbolised the gift of light to the world, as the shewbread the gift of life and sustenance, flowing from the presence of God.<p><span class= "bld">The flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs </span>are the parts of the candlestick (mentioned in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/25-37.htm" title="And you shall make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.">Exodus 25:37-38</a>); the “flowers” being the ornaments of the stem and branches, the “lamps” being the seven lights, and the “tongs” being used for trimming.<p>The various articles here mentioned are also enumerated in the description of the furniture of the Tabernacle, <a href="/context/exodus/25-29.htm" title="And you shall make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover with: of pure gold shall you make them.">Exodus 25:29-38</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The snuffers.</span>—The word is derived from a root signifying “to prune,” and is used for “pruning knives” in <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm" title="And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.">Isaiah 2:4</a> and <a href="/micah/4-3.htm" title="And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.">Micah 4:3</a>.
