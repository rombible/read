Mr. Fergusson considers that they were supports to the roof of the vestibule; and if this were thirty cubits high, the twenty-seven cubits of each pillar, allowing for the slope of the roof to the apex, would suit well enough. But the absence of all reference to their position as parts of the building, and the entire separation of the description of their fabrication from the account of the building itself, rather favoured the other supposition, that they were isolated pillars set up in front of the porch as symbolic monuments, conveying the idea of Psalms 46, “God is our hope and strength;” “God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed.” It is particularly noticed (<a href="/context/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13-16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm" title="Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:17</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/52-20.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.">Jeremiah 52:20-23</a>) that they were broken up by the Chaldæans. on the capture of Jerusalem, and the brass carried away. The description is exceedingly elaborate, and, except in one or two parts, clear enough. The shaft of each pillar was twenty-seven feet high, and its diameter something less than six feet. Josephus says that it was hollow, but of considerable thickness. Above the shaft was a chapiter (or capital) of great proportionate size (seven and a half feet high), covered with a net-work and festoons of metal-work, and ornamented with two rows of pomegranates, a hundred in each row. Over these again was “lily-work” of six feet in height—probably some conventionalised foliage, technically known by that name, like the “honeysuckle ornament” in classical architecture, or the conventional “dog-tooth” or “ball-flower” of Gothic. The whole height, even if there were no base or plinth below, would be twenty-seven cubits, or forty feet and a half. In the Dict. of the Bible (TEMPLE) is given a drawing of a pillar at Persepolis, which bears a considerable resemblance to the general description here given, but, being executed in stone, is far less elaborate in ornamentation. The whole style of the narrative shows that these were regarded as monuments of the highest artistic skill, and well known to all, as from their position they would be constantly before the eyes both of priests and people. There was, so far as can be seen, nothing to correspond to them in the Tabernacle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/7-15.htm" title="For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about....">1 Kings 7:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">He cast two pillars of brass — </span>Of which see <a href="/context/2_kings/25-16.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight....">2 Kings 25:16-17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-21.htm" title="And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.">Jeremiah 52:21</a>. <span class="ital">Of eighteen cubits high apiece — </span>It is said, <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.">2 Chronicles 3:15</a>, that these pillars were thirty-five cubits high, which relates to the height of both of them together without their pedestals, whereas the height of each is given here with its pedestal. <span class="ital">A line of twelve cubits did compass either of them — </span>The diameter, therefore, was four cubits, which, considering the chapiter of five cubits, added to the height of each pillar, (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.">2 Chronicles 3:15</a>,) was only in due proportion to the height.

It is certain that the Phoenicians used isolated metal columns as sacred ornaments, so that Hiram would be familiar with such a mode of ornamentation. Eighteen cubits appear to have been the height of the shaft only. Adding the capital <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a>, the entire metal pillar was 27 cubits high; and if it had a stone base of eight cubits, which would not be greatly out of proportion, the height of 35 cubits (52 12 feet, <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a>) would have been reached. The height of some of the Persepolitan columns, with which these pillars may be best compared, is 67 feet. The circumference of 12 cubits (18 feet) implies a diameter of about 5 feet 9 inches at the base, which would make the column somewhat heavy in appearance. Egyptian pillars were, however, even thicker in proportion to their height. On the supposition that a portion of the original text has fallen out, this verse has been thus completed: "He cast two pillars of brass; eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar, and eighteen cubits was the height of the other pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits compassed the other pillar." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-22. two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high&#8212;They were made of the brass (bronze) which was taken from the king of Zobah (1Ch 18:8). In 2Ch 3:15 they are said to have been thirty-five cubits high. There, however, their joint lengths are given; whereas here the length of the pillars is given separately. Each pillar was seventeen and a half cubits long, which is stated, in round numbers, as eighteen. Their dimensions in English measure are as follows: The pillars without the capitals measured thirty-two and a half feet long, and seven feet diameter; and if hollow, as Whiston, in his translation of Josephus, thinks (Jer 52:21), the metal would be about three and a half inches thick; so that the whole casting of one pillar must have been from sixteen to twenty tons. The height of the capitals was eight and three-fourths feet; and, at the same thickness of metal, would not weigh less than seven or eight tons each. The nature of the workmanship in the finishing of these capitals is described (1Ki 7:17-22). The pillars, when set up, would stand forty feet in height [Napier, Metal].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He cast two pillars of brass; </span> of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/25-16.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.">2 Kings 25:16</a>,17 Jer 52:21</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of eighteen cubits high apiece.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> They are said to be thirty-five cubits high, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.">2 Chronicles 3:15</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> That place manifestly speaks of both the pillars; and this of <span class="ital">each</span>, or <span class="ital">one</span> pillar, as it is in the Hebrew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> But then it should have been thirty-six cubits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> Either the odd half cubit is swallowed up either in the top of the chapiter, or in the bottom of the basis of each pillar; or it is neglected in the account, as commonly small measures or numbers are. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about; </span> so the diameter was four cubits, which, considering the chapiter of five cubits added to the height of each pillar, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/3-14.htm" title="And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and worked cherubim thereon.">2 Chronicles 3:14</a></span>, was not unproportionable to the height. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he cast two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece,....

And there is a like defect in the other half of this verse. For instead of ‘did compass either of them about’ the original gives ‘did compass the second pillar.’ The whole of the latter passage was no doubt ‘a line of twelve cubits did compass about the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits the second pillar.’ The A. V. gives the sense, and in a better fashion than by introducing italics to represent the missing words. The full form in similar phrases occurs immediately in <a href="/context/1_kings/7-16.htm" title="And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits:...">1 Kings 7:16-17</a>, and then in 18 there is an omission of one-half the description, just as has happened here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first portion of these pillars was 18 cubits = 27 feet high by 12 cubits = 18 feet in circumference. This of itself would make a pillar of disproportionate dimensions, but on the top there were placed chapiters (capitals) of 5 cubits = 7½ feet high. Thus the whole height would be 23 cubits or 34½ feet. It is said (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.">2 Chronicles 3:15</a>) that the pillars were 35 cubits high. In that case we should have to suppose them raised on bases of 12 cubits, which is out of all proportion. The metal work may have had some stone base to rest on, but that would never have been 18 feet high. It is more reasonable to suppose that the numbers, marked in Hebrew letters, have been misread by the Chronicler. See however the note on <a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm" title="And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.">1 Kings 6:3</a> above, with reference to these dimensions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These pillars were broken up and carried away along with other metal at the time of the Babylonian invasion, see <a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2 Kings 25:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm" title="Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:17</a>, in which latter passage the heights of the pillar and its capital are exactly as here, and in the former there is only a variation in the dimension of the capital, not of the pillar.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he cast two pillars of brass</span> [The process of casting, as practised by the ancients, receives considerable illustration from the paintings of Thebes (see Wilkinson, "Anc.

To this must be added the capital (vers. 16, 19), which measured five (or, according to some, nine) cubits, and probably the pedestal.

In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a> the height is given as thirty-five cubits - a discrepancy which has been variously explained.

Others think it a part of that systematic reduplication of the heights of edifices by the chronicler, of which we have already had an instance in ch. 6. (where see note). But the true explanation would seem to be that, by a clerical error, thirty-five (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>) has been substituted in the text for eighteen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;</span>).

[It must not be supposed, from the fact that the height of the one column is given, and the circumference of the other, that they were dissimilar in height and breadth or girth. There has probably been an accidental abbreviation of the full expression, "Eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar, and eighteen cubits was the height of the other pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits compassed the other pillar." It is just possible, however, that the peculiarity results from the actual system of  measurement employed in this case. As they were castings, it would be needless to measure both pillars, and so the length may have been ascertained from the first, and the breadth from the second. The columns would thus be about twenty-seven feet high, and about six feet in diameter.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"All these (viz., the whole of the buildings described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-8</a>) were costly stones, after the measure of that which is hewn, sawn with the saw within and without (i.e., on the inner and outer side of the halls and buildings), and from the foundation to the corbels, and from without to the great court," &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1508;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, the corbels, upon which the beams of the roof rest.
