Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution.

These names were given them not by Hiram the artificer, but by Solomon, and which were very expressive; not so much of the nobility of the kingdom of the house of David, as the Targum intimates; or of the church of God, the pillar and ground of truth; as of Christ himself, and the two natures in him, and of his royal dignity, signified by the crowns or chapiters on them, decorated as they were, whose legs are as pillars of marble, and in whom are righteousness and strength; which is no small encouragement to those who are entering into the church of God the temple was a type of; who, should they fear, being feeble and weak, that they should totter and fall, here stands Jachin, to let them know the Lord will establish and settle them; or that they should never hold out to the end, here is Boaz to direct them to Christ, in whom their strength lies, see Sol 4:15.

Both words are significant. The first is a verb (see <a href="/job/27-17.htm" title="He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.">Job 27:17</a>) signifying ‘he will prepare, or, establish,’ the second = ‘in him is strength.’ If they be interpreted they are both to be referred to God. Some have wished by a slight alteration of the Hebrew points in the latter word to combine the two into one sentence meaning ‘he will establish by strength.’ But it is not likely that a sentence would be thus split up to make two names.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he set up the pillars in the porch</span> [We are now confronted by the much vexed questions, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What was the position, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> what the purpose, of these two columns? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Were they <span class="accented">in</span> the porch, or before it? And were they architectural or monumental? Did they support the roof of the porch, or were they isolated and detached, after the manner of obelisks? I incline to the opinion of Bahr, that they stood <span class="accented">in</span> the porch, but that they formed no part of the building, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that they were not for any structural use, but simply for ornament. This appears to me, on the whole, to result from the following considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The language used favours a position within the porch. We have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (  =  "<span class="accented">at</span> or <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">the</span> porch," perhaps for the porch, as Bahr), and in ver. 19 (where see note) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. And with this agree the expression of the Chronicles "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the house," and "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the temple" (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15, 17</a>). The pillars would, however, be "before the temple," whether they stood within or in front of the porch, and it may be safely allowed that the language of the historian is not <span class="accented">decisive</span> one way or the other. The prepositions of the text, however, seem to lend some support to Bahr's view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We know that the Phoenicians used <span class="accented">isolated</span> metal columns as sacred ornaments, so that Hiram would be familiar with such a mode of ornamentation" (Rawlinson). "Whenever in coins or histories we get a  representation of a Phoenician temple, it always has a pillar or pillars standing within or before it" (Stanley). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is extremely doubtful whether these columns, twenty-three feet in height, were adapted to serve as supports to the roof of the porch. The height of the latter has been variously estimated at twenty, thirty, and sixty cubits, and whichever estimate is preferred, the columns would appear to be of an unsuitable altitude. Fergusson says they <span class="accented">were</span> "appropriate to support the roof of the porch," but then he conceives the columns to be in all twenty-seven cubits high (see on ver. 19), and allows the remaining three cubits for the slope of the roof). But, as we cannot be certain either of the height of the porch or of the column, this is an argument of which very little can be made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> If the pillars were part of the building, they would almost certainly have been of the same material, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, wood or stone. Their metallic composition is certainly an argument for their monumental character. It can hardly be alleged in favour of this view, however, that they are mentioned amongst the vessels or articles of furniture, for the historian might fittingly describe the pillars here, as being the principal of the "works in brass" which Hiram wrought, even if they did form the supports of the roof of the porch. Nor are we justified, considering the extreme brevity and the partial character of the description of the temple, in affirming that they would have been mentioned in connexion with the building, had they formed part of the edifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The remark of Stieglitz (cited by Bahr) that "it was their separate position alone which gave these pillars the impressive aspect they were designed to wear," lends some little support to this view. So also does <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The fact that these columns and these alone, received special names. "No architectural portion of the building received a name" (Keil). But this argument, again, is not too unduly pressed, for to some it may seem that the names they bore would have a special propriety and an enhanced significance, if the columns contributed to the <span class="accented">strength and stability</span> of the edifice. The question, therefore, is one of considerable complexity, the more so, as it is maintained that it would be almost impossible to construct a roof thirty feet in width without some such pillars to support the beam (Fergusson); but the balance of evidence appears to favour the view that Jachin and Boaz were monuments erected in the porch, to dignify the sanctuary, and to symbolize the power and eternity of the Being to whom it was dedicated]: <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin</span> [<span class="accented">i.e., he shall establish</span>, as marg. The name expressed the belief that God would preserve and protect the new lane. It is true that a Jachin is mentioned (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/24-17.htm">1 Chronicles 24:17</a>), as head of the 21st course of priests in the reign of David, while a Boaz was one of Solomon's ancestors, but the columns could hardly be named after them, or an private persons. Ewald suggests that they were named after "some favourites of the time, perhaps young sons of Solon on." The idea of Thenius that these names were engraved upon the pillars is not wholly improbable, though of course it finds no support in the text] <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the left pillar</span> [the left as one faced them from the house. The right hand is identified with the south in ver. 39], <span class="cmt_word">and called the name thereof Boaz.</span> [Marg. <span class="accented">in it is strength.</span> Probably "<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">Him, i.e.</span>, God, is its strength" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>). The thought of Jachin, "<span class="accented">He</span> will establish," is thus continued; and the two pillars pointed alike to the God of Israel as the true support and upholder of His sanctuary. The LXX. interpretation of these two names, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>), <span class="accented">success</span> and <span class="accented">strength</span>, though very far from literal, preserves their fundamental ideas. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brazen pillars of the porch (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15-17</a>). - He formed the two brazen pillars, which were erected, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a>, "before the (temple) house, i.e., in front of the hall of the temple. One was eighteen cubits high, and a thread of twelve cubits surrounded (spanned) the other pillar." The statement of the height of the one pillar and that of the circumference of the other is to be understood as an abbreviated expression, signifying that the height and thickness mentioned applied to the one as well as to the other, or that they were alike in height and circumference. According to the Chronicles, they were thirty-five cubits long; which many expositors understand as signifying that the length of the two together was thirty-five cubits, so that each one was only 17 1/2 cubits long, for which the full number 18 is substituted in our text. But this mode of reconciling the discrepancy is very improbable, and is hardly in harmony with the words of the Chronicles. The number 35 evidently arose from confounding the numeral letters &#1497;&#1495;  equals  18 with &#1500;&#1492;  equals  35. The correctness of the number 18 is confirmed by <a href="/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>. The pillars were hollow, the brass being four finger-breadths in thickness (<a href="/jeremiah/52-21.htm">Jeremiah 52:21</a>); and they were cast in the Jordan valley (<a href="/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a>).</body></html>
