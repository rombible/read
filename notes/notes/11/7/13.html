Looked at in itself, it shows that the Temple (like many other buildings in the comparative infancy of architecture) depended for its effect, not so much on size or proportion, as on rich material, elaborate decoration, and costly furniture, on which all the resources both of treasure and art were lavished. But besides this, the sense of the especial sacredness attached to all the vessels of the Temple, which was hereafter to degenerate into a Pharisaic superstition (see <a href="/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-18</a>), suggested the most careful record of every detail, and reverently traced to “the Spirit of God” the gift of “wisdom of heart” “to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,” as in Bezaleel and Aholiab for the Tabernacle (<a href="/context/exodus/35-31.htm" title="And he has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;">Exodus 35:31-32</a>), so also in Hiram for the Temple. There is something especially remarkable in this broad comprehensiveness of conception which recognises the illuminating and inspiring power of the Spirit of God, not only in the moral and religious teaching of the prophet and the devotional utterances of the psalmist, but in the warlike enthusiasm of the Judge, the sagacity of the statesman, the imaginative skill of the artist, and the wisdom of the philosophic thinker. Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the Apostolic declaration: “There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit” (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4</a>).<p>(13) <span class= "bld">And king Solomon sent.</span>—The record in the Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-7.htm" title="Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.">2Chronicles 2:7</a>; <a href="/context/2_chronicles/2-13.htm" title="And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,">2Chronicles 2:13-14</a>) gives what is evidently a more exact description of the facts here briefly alluded to. In Solomon’s first letter to King Hiram he asks for “a man cunning to work,” and with the answer the artificer Hiram is sent. His mixed parentage would enable him to enter into the spirit of the Israelite worship, and yet to bring to bear upon it the practical skill of the Tyrian artificer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/7-13.htm" title="And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre....">1 Kings 7:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Solomon sent and fetched Hiram </span>— Though he was an Israelite by birth, yet he dwelt at Tyre; and, it is likely, had the privileges of that city, and so was one of King Hiram’s subjects.

Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault.

The throne-hall and the judgment-hall are therefore one and the same hall, which was both a court of judgment and an audience-chamber, and in which, no doubt, there stood and splendid throne described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>. But it is distinguished from the pillar-hall by the repetition of &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;. It probably followed immediately upon this, but was clearly distinguished from it by the fact that it was covered with cedar &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1506; &#1506;&#1491; &#1502;&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1506;. These words are very obscure. The rendering given by Thenius, "panelled from the floor to the beams of the roof," is open to these objections: (1) that &#1505;&#1508;&#1503; generally does not mean to panel, but simply to cover, and that &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1494; &#1505;&#1508;&#1503; is particular cannot possibly be taken in a different sense here from that which it bears in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a>, where it denotes the roofing of the rooms built above the portico of pillars; and (2) that the alteration of the second &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1511;&#1506; into &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; has no critical warrant in the rendering of the Syriac, a fundamento ad coelum ejus usque, or in that of the Vulgate, a pavimento usque ad summitatem, whereas the lxx and Chald. both read &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511;&#1506; &#1506;&#1491;. But even if we were to read &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, this would not of itself signify the roof beams, inasmuch as in <a href="/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a> &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; receives its more precise definition from the expression &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1503; noisserpx &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;) in <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>. The words in question cannot have any other meaning than this: "from the one floor to the other," i.e., either from the floor of the throne-hall to the floor of the pillar-hall (described in <a href="/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>), or more probably from the lower floor to the upper, inasmuch as there were rooms built over the throne-room, just as in the case of the house of the forest of Lebanon; for &#1511;&#1512;&#1511;&#1506; may denote not only the lower floor, but also the floor of upper rooms, which served at the same time as the ceiling of the lower rooms. So much, at any rate, may be gathered from these words, with all their obscurity, that the throne-hall was not an open pillar-hall, but was only open in front, and was shut in by solid walls on the other three sides.</body></html>
