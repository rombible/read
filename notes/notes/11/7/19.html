Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault.

Probably the bowl-shaped chapiter was treated as a fullblown lily, just as the capitals of Egyptian pillars took the form of the lotus. The molten sea was similarly treated (ver. 26).

But that idea would have been expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, and nothing is said elsewhere about any lily work in the porch (Bahr). Ewald, too, thinks the decoration of the porch is referred to, and holds that a description of this lily work must once have preceded this statement, though it is now wanting. Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>. suppose them to refer to the position of the pillars within the porch, and the "four cubits" mentioned presently, they take to indicate the diameter of the capitals. Wordsworth would render "inside or <span class="accented">toward</span> the porch," and understands that the lily work was only on the <span class="accented">inside</span> of the pillars. It is, perhaps, impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion], <span class="cmt_word">four cubits</span>. [This may either mean that of five cubits (which was the height of the entire capital), four, and these the upper four (ver. 22), were covered with lily work, while one cubit at the bottom of the capital was ornamented with chain-work or festeons - we can hardly believe that nets, chains, and lily work were all combined in the same space, or it may refer to the position of the pillars in the portico.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Metallic Vessels of the Temple (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13-14</a>, and 3:15-5:1). - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>. To make these vessels king Hiram had sent to Solomon, at his request (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>), a workman named Hiram of Tyre. <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a> contains a supplementary remark, in which &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; must be rendered in the pluperfect (compare the remarks on <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>). King Solomon had sent and fetched Hiram from Tyre. This artisan bore the same name as the king, &#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; or &#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; (<a href="/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>), in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; (Huram), with the epithet &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, i.e., my father, &#1488;&#1489; being a title of honour equivalent to master or counsellor, as in <a href="/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>. He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, i.e., a Tyrian by birth. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>, his mother was "of the daughters of Dan," i.e., of the tribe of Dan. Both statements may easily be united thus: she was a Danite by birth, and married into the tribe of Naphtali. When her husband died, she was married again as the widow of a Naphtalite, and became the wife of a Tyrian, to whom she bore a son, Hiram. This explanation is also adopted by Bertheau (on the Chronicles); and the conjecture of Lundius, Thenius, and others, that the mother was an Israelitish widow of the city of Dan in the tribe of Naphtali, which was quite close to Tyre, is less in harmony with the expression "of the daughters of Dan." &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, "a brass-worker," refers to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (he), i.e., Hiram, and not to his father (Thenius). The skill of Hiram is described in almost the same terms as that of Bezaleel in <a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>., with this exception, that Bezaleel's skill is attributed to his being filled with the Spirit of God, i.e., is described rather as a supernatural gift, whereas in the case of Hiram the more indefinite expression, "he was filled with wisdom, etc.," is used, representing it rather as a natural endowment. In the account given here, Hiram is merely described as a worker in brass, because he is only mentioned at the commencement of the section which treats of the preparation of the brazen vessels of the temple. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>, he was able to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, wood, purple, etc. There is nothing improbable in this extension of his skill to wood and to the art of weaving. Bezaleel also combined in himself all these talents. Of course Hiram was merely a foreman or leader of these different branches of art; and he certainly did not come alone, but brought several assistants with him, who carried out the different works under his superintendence. - The enumeration of them commences with the pillars of the temple-hall. </body></html>
