Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace.

The supplement is needless, according to Dr. Lightfoot; the sense being only, that the chapiters were above the lily work, which wrought out as far as the belly of the chapiters, or the middle cubit of them, which the pomegranates filled up: <p>and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other chapiter: there were so many in each, which in all made four hundred, as in <a href="/1_kings/7-42.htm">1 Kings 7:42</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>, it is said there were ninety six on a side, and yet one hundred round about; the meaning of which is, either that there were twenty four to every wind, as the word there is, and four on the four angles, and so in all one hundred; or, as the above learned writer, when the pillars were set to the wall, only ninety six appeared in sight in a row, the other four being hid behind them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">And the chapiters upon the two pillars</span> had pomegranates <span class="ital">also above</span>] The italics are without justification. The R.V. gives the sense; ‘And <span class="bld">there were</span> chapiters also above upon the two pillars.’ What is now being described is that portion of the capital which was below the lily work.

The first has something of the idea of ‘all along’ and describes the way in which the pomegranates went close up to the bellying portion of the capital. Probably the two rows ran round the pillar, one just above, the other just below the enlarged part. Then the network appears to have been over the belly. The preposition intimates that if you could have looked from the woodwork, the metal nets and chains were just in front of you. So that in the ‘beside’ of the R.V. we must understand the notion of overlying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">two hundred</span>, in <span class="ital">rows</span>] As we have taken <a href="/1_kings/7-18.htm" title="And he made the pillars, and two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital.">1 Kings 7:18</a> the rows were two for each capital, so that 100 pomegranates were in each row. Apparently in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-16.htm" title="And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.">2 Chronicles 3:16</a> the number specified is only for one single row. In the parallel passage of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/52-23.htm" title="And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates on the network were an hundred round about.">Jeremiah 52:23</a>) this appears more clearly. For the pomegranates are said to have been arranged one at each of the four cardinal points and the other 96 used to complete the circuit.

The text, no doubt, originally stood "two hundred in rows round about the one chapiter, and two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter." There has been no intentional compression that is not the genius of the Semitic languages - but an accidental omission, occasioned by the recurrence of almost identical words. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Metallic Vessels of the Temple (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13-14</a>, and 3:15-5:1). - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>. To make these vessels king Hiram had sent to Solomon, at his request (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>), a workman named Hiram of Tyre. <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13</a> contains a supplementary remark, in which &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; must be rendered in the pluperfect (compare the remarks on <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>). King Solomon had sent and fetched Hiram from Tyre. This artisan bore the same name as the king, &#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501; or &#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501; (<a href="/1_kings/7-40.htm">1 Kings 7:40</a>), in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; (Huram), with the epithet &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, i.e., my father, &#1488;&#1489; being a title of honour equivalent to master or counsellor, as in <a href="/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>. He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, i.e., a Tyrian by birth. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>, his mother was "of the daughters of Dan," i.e., of the tribe of Dan. Both statements may easily be united thus: she was a Danite by birth, and married into the tribe of Naphtali. When her husband died, she was married again as the widow of a Naphtalite, and became the wife of a Tyrian, to whom she bore a son, Hiram. This explanation is also adopted by Bertheau (on the Chronicles); and the conjecture of Lundius, Thenius, and others, that the mother was an Israelitish widow of the city of Dan in the tribe of Naphtali, which was quite close to Tyre, is less in harmony with the expression "of the daughters of Dan." &#1504;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, "a brass-worker," refers to &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (he), i.e., Hiram, and not to his father (Thenius). The skill of Hiram is described in almost the same terms as that of Bezaleel in <a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>., with this exception, that Bezaleel's skill is attributed to his being filled with the Spirit of God, i.e., is described rather as a supernatural gift, whereas in the case of Hiram the more indefinite expression, "he was filled with wisdom, etc.," is used, representing it rather as a natural endowment. In the account given here, Hiram is merely described as a worker in brass, because he is only mentioned at the commencement of the section which treats of the preparation of the brazen vessels of the temple. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a>, he was able to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, wood, purple, etc. There is nothing improbable in this extension of his skill to wood and to the art of weaving. Bezaleel also combined in himself all these talents. Of course Hiram was merely a foreman or leader of these different branches of art; and he certainly did not come alone, but brought several assistants with him, who carried out the different works under his superintendence. - The enumeration of them commences with the pillars of the temple-hall. </body></html>
