Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Borders - Rather, "panels" (so <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-32.htm">1 Kings 7:32</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-35.htm">1 Kings 7:35</a>), a set of square compartments between the "ledges" or borders, or mouldings.

The description of their structure shows that they were elegantly fitted up and skilfully adapted to their purpose. They stood, not on the axles, but on four rests attached to the axles, so that the figured sides were considerably raised above the wheels. They were all exactly alike in form and size. The lavers which were borne upon them were vessels capable each of holding three hundred gallons of water, upwards of a ton weight. The whole, when full of water, would be no less than two tons [Napier].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They had borders; </span> broad brims, possibly for the more secure holding of the lavers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the work of the bases was on this manner,....
