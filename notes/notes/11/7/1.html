The LXX. transfers all this section 1–12 to the end of the chapter. In Chronicles, though Solomon’s own house is alluded to (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-11.htm" title="Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.">2 Chronicles 7:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,">2 Chronicles 8:1</a>), there is no description of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thirteen years</span>] The longer time occupied by this building, in comparison with the seven years and a half spent on the Temple, is accounted for by the greater extent of this latter work. The Temple was comparatively a small edifice, and for it years of preparation had preceded the actual work of the building.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he finished</span>] i.e. At the end of twenty years and rather more. See <a href="/1_kings/9-10.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,">1 Kings 9:10</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years</span> [There is no contrast implied between the time spent upon the temple and that occupied in the building of the palace, as the word "but" seems to suggest. The close connexion which exists in the original is interrupted by the division of chapters. In <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a> we read, "So was he seven years in building it." <a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a> then proceeds, "And he was building his  own house thirteen years." The much longer period occupied in the erection of the royal palace is easily accounted for. In the first place, the buildings were much larger, and the undertaking altogether was a much more extensive one (ver. 2). Then, though seven years only were consumed in the actual building of the temple, yet preparations for the work had been made, both by David and Solomon, for a long time beforehand. Lastly, a special force of labourers would appear to have been employed on the temple, while it is probable that they wrought at the palaces in greatly diminished numbers. So that the longer period spent over his own house does not argue selfishness or worldliness on Solomon's part. On the contrary, it speaks well for his piety that he built the temple first and urged on that sacred work with so much vigour. The thirteen years date from the completion of the seven years of <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>. That is to say, the building of the temple and palace together occupied twenty years, as is expressly stated in <a href="/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>. It is therefore one of Stanley's reckless statements that the palace "was commenced at the same time as the temple, but not finished till eight years afterwards"], <span class="cmt_word">and he finished all his house.</span> [By Solomon's "house" we are not to understand his private palace, or residence proper, alone (see ver. 8), but a range of palaces, more or less connected including the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (ver. 2), "the porch of pillars" (ver. 6), the throne-room or judgment hall (ver. 7), his own house and the house of Pharaoh's daughter (ver. 8). That all these are comprehended under the term "house" is evident from <a href="/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1, 10, 15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>, where Solomon's buildings are always spoken of as <span class="accented">two</span>, viz., "the house of the Lord" and the "king's house." The situation of this string of palaces is by no means certain. Josephus says it stood over against (or opposite) the temple, which is highly probable; but this still leaves the question of site open, for the palace would be justly described as <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, whether it stood west or south of the sanctuary. Ewald places it on the opposite ridge of Ophel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the south prolongation of the temple mount; while Fergusson, Bahr, etc., locate it on the northeast side of Zion, on the opposite side of the Tyropoean valley, and overlooking it and the whole city of David. Recent explorations seem to favour Ewald's view. See "Recovery of Jerusalem," pp. 319 sqq, and "Our Work in Palestine," p. 159 sqq. When we remember that the very site of <span class="accented">Zion</span> is disputed, it will not surprise the reader that questions of this kind should be involved in uncertainty. And when it is further considered that the accumulated <span class="accented">debris</span> of Jerusalem at one point reaches a depth of 120 feet, it will be readily understood what obstacles stand in the way of their settlement.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And thus he made upon the door of the Holy Place posts of olive wood from a fourth (of the wall)," i.e., a framework which occupied a fourth of the breadth of the wall, or was five cubits broad (see at <a href="/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>), "and two doors of cypress wood, two leaves each door turning," i.e., each of the folding doors consisting of two leaves, each of which was made to turn by itself, so that it could be opened and shut alone (without the other; &#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is probably only a copyist's error for &#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;). Cypress wood was chosen for the folding doors of the Holy Place, and not olive wood, as in the case of the Most Holy Place, probably because it is lighter in weight, and therefore less likely to sink. It is questionable here what idea we are to form of the division of each folding door into two leaves, each of which turned by itself: whether we are to think of each wing as divided lengthwise into two narrow leaves, or as divided half way up, so that the lower half could be opened without the upper. I agree with Merz in thinking the latter the more probable assumption; for the objection made by Thenius, on the ground that doors of this kind are only seen in the houses of the peasantry, is an idle assertion which cannot be proved. In a doorway of five cubits in breadth, after reckoning the doorposts the width of the two wings could not be more than two cubits each. And if such a door had been divided into two halves, each half would have been only one cubit wide, so that when open it would not have furnished the requisite room for one man conveniently to pass through. On the other hand, we may assume that a folding door of four cubits in breadth, if made in just proportions, would be eight cubits high. And a door of such a height might easily be divided into two halves, so that only the lower half (of two cubits in breadth and about four in height) was opened for the daily entrance of the priests into the Holy Place. These doors probably opened outwards, like those in front of the Most Holy Place.</body></html>
