Of the House of Lebanon.<p>2. He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon&#8212;It is scarcely possible to determine whether this was a different edifice from the former, or whether his house, the house of the forest of Lebanon, and the one for Pharaoh's daughter, were not parts of one grand palace. As difficult is it to decide what was the origin of the name; some supposing it was so called because built on Lebanon; others, that it was in or near Jerusalem, but contained such a profuse supply of cedar columns as to have occasioned this peculiar designation. We have a similar peculiarity of name in the building called the East India house, though situated in London. The description is conformable to the arrangement of Eastern palaces. The building stood in the middle of a great oblong square, which was surrounded by an enclosing wall, against which the houses and offices of those attached to the court were built. The building itself was oblong, consisting of two square courts, flanking a large oblong hall which formed the center, and was one hundred cubits long, by fifty broad. This was properly the house of the forest of Lebanon, being the part where were the cedar pillars of this hall. In front was the porch of judgment, which was appropriated to the transaction of public business. On the one side of this great hall was the king's house; and on the other the harem or royal apartments for Pharaoh's daughter (Es 2:3, 9). This arrangement of the palace accords with the Oriental style of building, according to which a great mansion always consists of three divisions, or separate houses&#8212;all connected by doors and passages&#8212;the men dwelling at one extremity, the women of the family at the other, while public rooms occupy the central part of the building.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All these</span> buildings described here and in the former chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the measures of hewed stones; </span> either first, which were hewed in such measure and proportion, as exact workmen used to hew ordinary stones; or, secondly, as large as common hewed stones, which are oft very great. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Within and without; </span> both on the inside of the buildings which were covered with cedar, and on the outside also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the foundation unto the coping; </span> from the bottom to the top of the building. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On the outside toward the great court; </span> not only on the outside of the front of the house, which being most visible, men are more careful to adorn; but also of the other side of the house, which looked towards the great court belonging to the king’s house. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All these were of costly stones,....

The front part, which was the house of the forest, is not mentioned, but it said that the good work extended unto the great court, which lay farthest back of all the buildings.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>buildings palaces] <span class="cmt_word">were of</span> <span class="cmt_word">costly</span> [or precious; cf. 1 Kings 5:31 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>  and vers. 10, 11] <span class="cmt_word">stones, according to the measures</span> <span class="cmt_word">of hewed stones</span> [lit., of <span class="accented">squaring</span> or <span class="accented">hewing</span>, same word in 1 Kings 5:31 (Hebr.) <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>, 1 Kings 6:36, and <a href="/isaiah/9-9.htm">Isaiah 9:9</a>, etc. All the stones in these several buildings were shaped to certain specified dimensions], sawed with saws [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> is obviously an onomatopoetic word, <span class="accented">like our saw.</span> Gesenius cites <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">serro, etc.</span> The Egyptians, whose saws were apparently <span class="accented">all</span> single handed, do not seem to have applied this instrument to stone, but part of a double-handed saw was found at Nimrud (Layard, p. 195, and Dict.

That saws were in common use and were made of iron is implied in <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>], <span class="cmt_word">within and without</span> [It is not quite clear whether the meaning is that the two surfaces exposed to view, one within and the other without, the building were shaped with saws, or that the inner and hidden surface of the stone was thus smoothed as well as the exposed parts], <span class="cmt_word">even from the foundation unto the coping</span> [or <span class="accented">corbels.</span> It is generally agreed (Gesen., Keil, Bight) that the reference is to the "projecting stones <span class="cmt_word">on</span> which the beams rest," though Thenius would understand <span class="accented">battlements</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-8.htm">Deuteronomy 22:8</a>) to be intended. But for these a different word is always used, and the LXX <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> signifies the projection of the roof, not an erection upon it], <span class="cmt_word">and so on the outside toward the great court</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the pavement of the court was of sawed stones (see ver. 12).] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And roofing in (of) cedar was above the over the side-rooms upon the pillars, five and forty; fifteen the row." &#1505;&#1508;&#1503; is to be understood of the roofing, as in <a href="/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a> (compare &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1503;,   <a href="/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>). The numbers "forty-five and fifteen the row" cannot refer to &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, but must refer, as Thenius assumes, to &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; as the main idea, which is more precisely defined by &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;. If we took it as referring to the pillars, as I myself have formerly done, we should have to assume that there were only galleries or pillar-halls above the lower rows of pillars, which is at variance with &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;. There were forty-five side-rooms, therefore, built upon the lower rows of pillars, in ranges of fifteen each. This could only be done by the ranges of rooms being built, not side by side, but one over the other, in other words, by the forty-five side-rooms forming three stories, as in the side buildings of the temple, so that each story had a "row" of fifteen side-rooms round it. This view receives support from <a href="/1_kings/7-4.htm">1 Kings 7:4</a> : "and beam-layers (&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, beams, as in <a href="/1_kings/6-4.htm">1 Kings 6:4</a>) were three rows, and outlook against outlook three times;" i.e., the rows of side-rooms were built one over the other by means of layers of beams, so that the rooms had windows opposite to one another three times; that is to say, the windows looking out upon the court were so arranged in the three stories that those on the one side were vis  vis to those on the opposite side of the building. The expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-5.htm">1 Kings 7:5</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, "window over against window," compels us to take &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; in the sense of "opposite to the window" (&#1488;&#1500;, versus), and not, as Thenius proposes, "outlook against outlook," according to which &#1488;&#1500; is supposed to indicate that the windows were only separated from one another by slender piers. &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492;, which only occurs here, is different from &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, the ordinary window, and probably denotes a large opening affording a wide outlook.</body></html>
