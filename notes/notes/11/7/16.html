Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The general character of the "chapiters" or capitals, their great size in proportion to the shaft, which is as one to two, and their construction of two quite different members, remind us of the pillars used by the Persians in their palaces, which were certainly more like Jachin and Boaz than any pillars that have reached us from antiquity. The ornamentation, however, seems to have been far more elaborate than that of the Persian capitals. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-22. two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high&#8212;They were made of the brass (bronze) which was taken from the king of Zobah (1Ch 18:8). In 2Ch 3:15 they are said to have been thirty-five cubits high. There, however, their joint lengths are given; whereas here the length of the pillars is given separately. Each pillar was seventeen and a half cubits long, which is stated, in round numbers, as eighteen. Their dimensions in English measure are as follows: The pillars without the capitals measured thirty-two and a half feet long, and seven feet diameter; and if hollow, as Whiston, in his translation of Josephus, thinks (Jer 52:21), the metal would be about three and a half inches thick; so that the whole casting of one pillar must have been from sixteen to twenty tons. The height of the capitals was eight and three-fourths feet; and, at the same thickness of metal, would not weigh less than seven or eight tons each. The nature of the workmanship in the finishing of these capitals is described (1Ki 7:17-22). The pillars, when set up, would stand forty feet in height [Napier, Metal].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The height of the one chapiter was five cubits.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> It is but <span class="ital">three</span> cubits in <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/25-17.htm" title="The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was brass: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.">2 Kings 25:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> The word <span class="bld">chapiter</span> is taken diversely, as hundreds of other words are; either more largely for the whole, so it is five cubits; or more strictly, either for the <span class="ital">pommels</span>, as they are called, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/4-12.htm" title="To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;">2 Chronicles 4:12</a></span>, or for the cornice or crown; and so it was but three cubits, to which the pomegranates being added make it four cubits, as it is below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/7-19.htm" title="And the capitals that were on the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.">1 Kings 7:19</a></span>; and the other work upon it took up one cubit more, which in all made five cubits. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars,....

See <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-22.htm">Jeremiah 52:22</a>. A much more important question is whether the chapiter (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> same word, akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, crown) of four cubits mentioned in ver. 19 is to be understood as a part of this chapiter, or something additional and superposed, the entablature, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> The former appears the more probable. See note on ver. 19. But it is not a fatal objection to the latter view that it would make the entire chapiter, or both members, nine cubits high; no less, that is, than one-half the length of the shaft. No doubt to modern ideas this appears wholly disproportionate; but a double chapiter, bearing the same proportion to the shaft, is found in some of the buildings of Persepolis (Fergusson,. Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457). From the expression of vers. 41, 42, "the bowls of the chapiters" (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>), and the word "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) in ver. 20, we gather that the chapiters were bowl shaped, or bellied out something like the so called "cushion capital" in Norman architecture. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the foundation was laid with costly, large stones of ten and eight cubits (sc., in length, and of corresponding breadth and thickness).
