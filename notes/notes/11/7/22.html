Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault. Let us bless God for the fountain opened by the sacrifice of Christ for sin and for uncleanness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Septuagint in the parallel passage (margin reference), translate Jachin and Boaz by &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  Katortho&#772;sis and &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;  Ischus - "Direction" and "Strength."

Hence it was fit to speak of it here, where it is said the work of the pillars was finished.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have already seen that it is not probable that these pillars stood out in the open space of the court, but on either side within the porch which was before the holy place. Their dimensions give the impression that they were only for ornament, and did not bear up any part of the structure. The height of the porch is not mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm" title="And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.">1 Kings 6:3</a>. Therefore we might presume that it was the height of the rest of the building of the holy place, viz. 30 cubits. Even for such a porch these pillars of 23 cubits could hardly have been intended as supports. But in 2 Chronicles (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm" title="And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer on that altar.">1 Kings 3:4</a>) the porch is said to have been 120 cubits high, and so in Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> viii. 3, 2), for which height pillars like those here described are quite out of proportion. Moreover, none of Hiramâ€™s work seems to have been intended for the temple-building, but only for its decoration and furniture. It seems best therefore to consider these pillars as significant ornaments of the Temple porch. See also on this matter the note on <a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm" title="And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.">1 Kings 6:3</a> above.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And upon the top of the pillars</span> <span class="cmt_word">was lily work</span> [a repetition, in the Hebrew manner, of ver. 19. The "lily work," which probably involved two things, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the capital had a rude resemblance to a "full blown lily cup" (Bahr), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that representations of the leaf of the lily ere pourtrayed upon it (as in the cornice of Hersepolis, an illustration of which will be found Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457), was a not unfitting finial to the column, as it formed a sort of crown or chaplet upon it. The two pillars would thus resemble two giant plants, the column answering to the stalk, the capital to the flower. The ideas of architecture, it is well known, have very frequently been derived from the vegetable kingdom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And he made two capitals (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;), to set them on the heads of the pillars, cast in brass, five cubits the height of the one and of the other capital." If, on the other hand, in <a href="/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a> the height of the capital is said to have been three cubits, this discrepancy cannot be explained on the supposition that the capitals had been reduced two cubits in the course of time; but the statement rests, like the parallel passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-22.htm">Jeremiah 52:22</a>, upon an error of the text, i.e., upon the substitution of &#1490; (3) for &#1492; (5).</body></html>
