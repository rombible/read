Keil renders it: “And the mouth of it (the laver) was within the chapiter, and in a cubit above it; and the mouth of it (the chapiter) was round, after the manner of pedestal, a cubit and a half; and upon the mouth was carved work, and the panels of it (the mouth) were square, not round.” But the rendering of the word “mouth,” now for the laver, now for the chapiter, is arbitrary, and the whole is still obscure. As the circular stand (or chapiter) was half a cubit deep, it looks as if the lower surface of the laver was a cubit above the “mouth.” If the laver were emptied by a cock near the bottom, this circular stand may have received the drippings. And as the top of this base would be square on plan, and the stand circular, there would be, of course, spaces left at each corner, which may possibly be the engraved “panels” referred to.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/7-31.htm" title="And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also on the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.">1 Kings 7:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">The mouth of it — </span>So he calls that part in the top of the base which was left hollow, that the foot of the laver might be let into it. <span class="ital">Within the chapiter — </span>Within the little base, which he calls <span class="ital">the chapiter, </span>because it rose up from, and stood above the great base. <span class="ital">And above — </span>Above the chapiter; for the mouth went up and grew wider like a funnel. <span class="ital">Was a cubit</span> — In height, (<a href="/1_kings/7-35.htm" title="And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.">1 Kings 7:35</a>,) whereof half a cubit was above the chapiter or little base, and the other half below it. <span class="ital">A cubit and half — </span>In compass. <span class="ital">Four-square — </span>So the innermost part, called the mouth, was round, but the outward part was square, as when a circle is made within a quadrangle.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:13-47 The two brazen pillars in the porch of the temple, some think, were to teach those that came to worship, to depend upon God only, for strength and establishment in all their religious exercises. Jachin, God will fix this roving mind. It is good that the heart be established with grace. Boaz, In him is our strength, who works in us both to will and to do. Spiritual strength and stability are found at the door of God's temple, where we must wait for the gifts of grace, in use of the means of grace. Spiritual priests and spiritual sacrifices must be washed in the laver of Christ's blood, and of regeneration. We must wash often, for we daily contract pollution. There are full means provided for our cleansing; so that if we have our lot for ever among the unclean it will be our own fault.
