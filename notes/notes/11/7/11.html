Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's.

Ewald, 284, a., &#x3b2;). "Square with a straight upper beam" (Thenius) cannot be the correct rendering of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1507; &#1512;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;. Thenius proposes to read &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1514; for &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1514;, after the reading &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; of the Seventy, who have also rendered &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; in <a href="/1_kings/7-4.htm">1 Kings 7:4</a> by &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, a broad space. It may be pleaded in support of this, that &#1512;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; taht , is less applicable to the doorposts or mouldings than to the doorways and outlooks (windows), inasmuch as, if the doorways were square, the square form of the moulding or framework would follow as a matter of course. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; are both the doors, through which the different rooms were connected with one another, and also those through which the building and its stories were reached, of course by stairs, probably winding staircases, as in the side stories of the temple. The stairs were placed, no doubt, at the front of the building. The height given is thirty cubits, corresponding to that of the whole building (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>). If we reckon the height of the lower pillars at eight cubits, there were twenty-two cubits left for the stories; and assuming that the roofing of each was one cubit in thickness, there remained eighteen cubits in all for the rooms of the three stories; and this, if equally distributed, would give an internal height of six cubits for each story, or if arranged on a graduated scale, which would probably be more appropriate, a height of seven, six, and five cubits respectively.</body></html>
