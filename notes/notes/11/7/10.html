Solomon began with the temple; he built for God first, and then his other buildings. The surest foundations of lasting prosperity are laid in early piety. He was thirteen years building his house, yet he built the temple in little more than seven years; not that he was more exact, but less eager in building his own house, than in building God's.

The numbers "forty-five and fifteen the row" cannot refer to &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, but must refer, as Thenius assumes, to &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; as the main idea, which is more precisely defined by &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;. If we took it as referring to the pillars, as I myself have formerly done, we should have to assume that there were only galleries or pillar-halls above the lower rows of pillars, which is at variance with &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;. There were forty-five side-rooms, therefore, built upon the lower rows of pillars, in ranges of fifteen each. This could only be done by the ranges of rooms being built, not side by side, but one over the other, in other words, by the forty-five side-rooms forming three stories, as in the side buildings of the temple, so that each story had a "row" of fifteen side-rooms round it. This view receives support from <a href="/1_kings/7-4.htm">1 Kings 7:4</a> : "and beam-layers (&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, beams, as in <a href="/1_kings/6-4.htm">1 Kings 6:4</a>) were three rows, and outlook against outlook three times;" i.e., the rows of side-rooms were built one over the other by means of layers of beams, so that the rooms had windows opposite to one another three times; that is to say, the windows looking out upon the court were so arranged in the three stories that those on the one side were vis  vis to those on the opposite side of the building. The expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-5.htm">1 Kings 7:5</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, "window over against window," compels us to take &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492; in the sense of "opposite to the window" (&#1488;&#1500;, versus), and not, as Thenius proposes, "outlook against outlook," according to which &#1488;&#1500; is supposed to indicate that the windows were only separated from one another by slender piers. &#1502;&#1495;&#1494;&#1492;, which only occurs here, is different from &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, the ordinary window, and probably denotes a large opening affording a wide outlook.</body></html>
