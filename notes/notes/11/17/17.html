This was a terrible and unexpected stroke to this widow, and, no doubt, was sent for the further trial of her faith and patience. She had received a great prophet into her house, was employed to sustain him, and had reason to think that surely the Lord would do her good; yet now she loses her son. We must not think it strange if we meet with very sharp afflictions, even when we are in the way of duty, and of eminent service to God: nay, and when we have the clearest manifestations of God’s favour and good-will toward us, even then we should prepare for the rebukes of his providence; our mountain never stands so strong but it may be moved, and therefore, in this world, we ought always to rejoice with trembling.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:17-24 Neither faith nor obedience shut out afflictions and death. The child being dead, the mother spake to the prophet, rather to give vent to her sorrow, than in hope of relief. When God removes our comforts from us, he remembers our sins against us, perhaps the sins of our youth, though long since past. When God remembers our sins against us, he designs to teach us to remember them against ourselves, and to repent of them. Elijah's prayer was doubtless directed by the Holy Spirit. The child revived.

Without answering her bitter upbraiding, the prophet takes the child, lays it on his bed, and after a very earnest prayer, had the happiness of seeing its restoration, and along with it, gladness to the widow's heart and home. The prophet was sent to this widow, not merely for his own security, but on account of her faith, to strengthen and promote which he was directed to go to her rather than to many widows in Israel, who would have eagerly received him on the same privileged terms of exception from the grinding famine. The relief of her bodily necessities became the preparatory means of supplying her spiritual wants, and bringing her and her son, through the teachings of the prophet, to a clear knowledge of God, and a firm faith in His word (Lu 4:25).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">no soul</span>, or <span class="ital">life</span>, as this Hebrew word oft signifies, i.e. he died, as is manifest from the following verses.

Yet both the mother and the prophet speak in the narrative of the ‘slaying’ of the son. The soul was departed, and it is the breathing into man of the breath of life, which makes him ‘a living soul.’ All the language of Scripture speaks in the same tone. ‘When the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turn again to his earth.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</span> [Does this mean that he was dead?

It must be confessed also that the statement, "his sickness was so sore," etc., is quite <span class="accented">apropos</span> and intelligible, if we may understand that he lay in a state of coma, but would be an extremely roundabout way of affirming that he was dead. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Elijah arrived at the city gate, he met a widow engaged in gathering wood. To discover whether it was to her that the Lord had sent him, he asked her for something to drink and for a morsel of bread to eat; whereupon she assured him, with an oath by Jehovah, that she had nothing baked (&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1490;  equals  &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, a cake baked in hot ashes), but only a handful of meal in the &#1499;&#1468;&#1491; (a pail or small vessel in which meal was kept) and a little oil in the pitcher, and that she was just gathering wood to dress this remnant for herself and her son, that they might eat it, and then die. From this statement of the widow it is evident, on the one hand, that the drought and famine had spread across the Phoenician frontier, as indeed Menander of Ephesus attests;<p>(Note: Josephus gives this statement from his Phoenician history: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (sc., &#x399;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;) &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; (Ant. viii. 13, 2). Hyperberetaeus answers to Tishri of the Hebrews; cf. Benfey and Stern, die Monatsnamen, p. 18.)<p>on the other hand, the widow showed by the oath, "as Jehovah thy God liveth," that she was a worshipper of the true God, who spoke of Jehovah as his God, because she recognised the prophet as an Israelite. </body></html>
