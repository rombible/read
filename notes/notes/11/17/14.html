Jezebel was Elijah's greatest enemy; yet, to show her how powerless was her malice, God will find a hiding-place for him even in her own country. The person appointed to entertain Elijah is not one of the rich or great men of Sidon; but a poor widow woman, in want, and desolate, is made both able and willing to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, to make use of, and put honour upon, the weak and foolish things of the world. O woman, great was thy faith; one has not found the like, no not in Israel. She took the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it. Those who can venture upon the promise of God, will make no difficulty to expose and empty themselves in his service, by giving him his part first. Surely the increase of this widow's faith, so as to enable her thus readily to deny herself, and to depend upon the Divine promise, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the increase of her meal and oil in the kingdom of providence. Happy are all who can thus, against hope, believe and obey in hope. One poor meal's meat this poor widow gave the prophet; in recompence of it, she and her son did eat above two years, in a time of famine. To have food from God's special favour, and in such good company as Elijah, made it more than doubly sweet. It is promised to those who trust in God, that they shall not be ashamed in evil time; in days of famine they shall be satisfied.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the Lord thy God liveth - The words do not prove that the woman was an Israelite, or a worshipper of the true God; any Phoenician, recognizing in Elijah's appearance the garb and manner of a Jehovistic prophet, might have thus addressed him: Baal-worshippers would have admitted Yahweh to be "a" living God. The woman does not say "as the Lord my God liveth."<p>That we may eat it and die - Phoenicia always depended for its cereal supplies on the harvests of Palestine (<a href="/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a> note); and it is evident that the famine was afflicting the Phoenicians at this time no less than the Israelites. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 17:8-16.

Meeting, at his entrance into the town, the very woman who was appointed by divine providence to support him, his faith was severely tested by learning from her that her supplies were exhausted and that she was preparing her last meal for herself and son. The Spirit of God having prompted him to ask, and her to grant, some necessary succor, she received a prophet's reward (Mt 10:41, 42), and for the one meal afforded to him, God, by a miraculous increase of the little stock, afforded many to her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, </span> in whom I perceive thou trustest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The barrel of meal, </span> i.e. the meal of the barrel; an hypallage or metonymy.

It has been said that there is not a syllable here to imply a miracle, and it has been contended that this Sareptan household was sustained for over two years simply by the blessing of God on the use of natural means. But clearly, if there was nothing else, there was supernatural knowledge on Elijah's part. And it cannot be denied that the literal construction of the words points to a "supernatural and inexplicable multiplication of food" (Rawlinson), similar to those of which the Gospels tell. It is just possible that this was a figure of speech, which practically meant no more than the necessaries of life should somehow be provided, directly or indirectly, by God. Nor is this view effectually negatived, as Bahr contends, by <a href="/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26</a>; but, in view of <a href="/2_kings/4-44.htm">2 Kings 4:44</a>, <a href="/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15-21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32-38</a>, it is extremely improbable.

Zarephath (&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, lxx) was situated on the Mediterranean Sea between Tyre and Sidon, where a miserable Mohammedan village with ruins and a promontory, Surafend, still preserve the name of the former town (Rob. iii. p. 413ff., and V. de Velde, Syria and Palestine, i. pp. 101-3, transl.). </body></html>
