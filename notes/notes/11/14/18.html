Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jeroboam had by this time removed from Shechem, and established a new capital in Tirzah, one of the old Canaanite towns <a href="/joshua/12-24.htm">Joshua 12:24</a> - a town of great reputation for beauty, counted in that respect on a par with Jerusalem Sol 6:4. Tirzah is perhaps to be identified with "Telluzah," a place in the mountains about 9 miles distant from Shechem (Nablous) (or with Teiasir - Conder). It may have been the palatial residence of the kings rather than the actual capital of the country. It remained the capital until Omri built Samaria <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-23.htm">1 Kings 16:23-24</a>. Toward the close of the kingdom it appears again as the city of Menahem, who murdered Shallum and succeeded him <a href="/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14</a>.<p>The threshold of the door - literally," the threshold of the house." Compare the prophecy <a href="/1_kings/14-12.htm">1 Kings 14:12</a>. The child actually died as she crossed the threshold of the palace. Probably the palace, like that of Sargon at Khorsabad, lay at the outer edge of the town. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Tirzah&#8212;a place of pre-eminent beauty (So 6:4), three hours' travelling east of Samaria, chosen when Israel became a separate kingdom, by the first monarch, and used during three short reigns as a residence of the royal house. The fertile plains and wooded hills in that part of the territory of Ephraim gave an opening to the formation of parks and pleasure-grounds similar to those which were the "paradises" of Assyrian and Persian monarchs [Stanley]. Its site is occupied by the large village of Taltise [Robinson]. As soon as the queen reached the gate of the palace, she received the intelligence that her son was dying, according to the prophet's prediction [1Ki 14:12].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they buried him,....

He would die as soon as she entered the city, and of all the male members of the house of Jeroboam he only would receive the honour of a proper burial, because in him there was some good thing towards Jehovah found. Ewald (247, b.) regards the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492; as standing for &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468;, and refers the suffix to the following word &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (vid., Ewald, 309, c.). But as this use of the suffix would be very harsh, the question arises whether &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; is not to be regarded as a feminine form of the infinitive, after the analogy of &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; in <a href="/exodus/2-4.htm">Exodus 2:4</a> and &#1500;&#1491;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-3.htm">2 Kings 19:3</a>, etc. From the fulfilment of this declaration in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>, <a href="/1_kings/14-18.htm">1 Kings 14:18</a> Jeroboam was to learn that the threatened destruction of his royal house would also be just as certainly fulfilled. The sick son appears to have been the heir-presumptive to the throne. This may be inferred partly from the lamentation of all Israel at his death (<a href="/1_kings/14-18.htm">1 Kings 14:18</a>), and partly from what follows here in the next verse. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; means in his relation to Jehovah.</body></html>
