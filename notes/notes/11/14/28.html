The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of the heathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple and his worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend; for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us. The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and all the advantages with which their religion was attended, could not prevail to keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out the Spirit will keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes, makes poor, and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took away the treasures.

Even though this king had been Solomon's father-in-law, he was no relation of Rehoboam's; but there is a strong probability that he belonged to another dynasty (see on [313]2Ch 12:2).

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12:1</a>, he appears to have been brought to reflection by the announcement of the prophet, that the falling away of the ten tribes had come from the Lord as a punishment for Solomon's idolatry (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-23.htm">1 Kings 12:23-24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-2.htm">2 Chronicles 11:2-4</a>); and in the first years of his reign to have followed the law of God with earnestness, and to have been occupied in the establishment of his government partly by the fortification of different cities (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12</a>), and partly by setting in order his domestic affairs, placing his numerous sons, who were born of his many wives and concubines, in the fortified cities of the land, and thus providing for them, and naming Abijam as his successor (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-18.htm">2 Chronicles 11:18-22</a>); while his kingdom was still further strengthened by the priests, Levites, and pious Israelites who emigrated to Judah and Jerusalem from the ten tribes (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-17</a>). But this good beginning only lasted three years (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-17.htm">2 Chronicles 11:17</a>). When he thought that he had sufficiently fortified his kingdom, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel (i.e., all the covenant nation) with him (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>). "Judah did that which was displeasing in the sight of the Lord; they provoked Him to jealousy more than all that their fathers (sc., under the Judges) had done with their sins." &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;, to provoke to jealousy (<a href="/numbers/5-14.htm">Numbers 5:14</a>), is to be explained, when it refers to God, from the fact that the relation in which God stood to His people was regarded under the figure of a marriage, in which Jehovah appears as the husband of the nation, who is angry at the unfaithfulness of his wife, i.e., at the idolatry of the nation.
