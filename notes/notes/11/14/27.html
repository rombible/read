The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of the heathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple and his worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend; for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us. The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and all the advantages with which their religion was attended, could not prevail to keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out the Spirit will keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes, makes poor, and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took away the treasures.

It is still a question whether the submission of the Jewish king is or is not expressly recorded in the Karnak inscription. Midway in the list of cities and tribes occurs the entry "YUDeH-MALK" which it has been proposed to translate "Judah, king." Others regard it as the name of a Palestinian town not otherwise known to us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Ki 14:25-31.

Rehoboam, who ascended the throne at the age of forty-one, was born a year before the accession of Solomon (see at <a href="/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>). In the description of Jerusalem as the city chosen by the Lord (cf., <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>) there is implied not so much an indirect condemnation of the falling away of the ten tribes, as the striking contrast to the idolatry of Rehoboam referred to in <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. The name of his mother is mentioned (here and in <a href="/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>), not because she seduced the king to idolatry (Ephr. Syr.), but generally on account of the great influence which the queen-mother appears to have had both upon the king personally and upon his government, as we may infer from the fact that the mother's name is given in the case of every king of Judah (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>, <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>, etc.).</body></html>
