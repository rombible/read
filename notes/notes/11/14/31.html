The abounding of the worst crimes, of the worst of the heathen, in Jerusalem, the city the Lord had chosen for his temple and his worship, shows that nothing can mend the hearts of fallen men but the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. On this alone may we depend; for this let us daily pray, in behalf of ourselves and all around us. The splendour of their temple, the pomp of their priesthood, and all the advantages with which their religion was attended, could not prevail to keep them close to it; nothing less than the pouring out the Spirit will keep God's Israel in their allegiance to him. Sin exposes, makes poor, and weakens any people. Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took away the treasures. Sin makes the gold become dim, changes the most fine gold, and turns it into brass.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Slept with his fathers and was buried ... - Compare <a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>.

As she is twice called "the Ammonitess" it can hardly be doubted that she was one of the "Ammonitesses" (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, Hebrews) who turned away Solomon's heart; and it is also certain that Rehoboam did not inherit his folly from his father. At the same time these words are more easily accounted for on the supposition that the historian found them in this position in one or more of the documents from which he compiled his history. It is also to be remembered that some of these chronological statements are manifestly by a later hand, and have been transferred from the margin to the text.

The supposition of Lightfoot that the name was designedly altered by the historian <span class="cmt_word">to</span> avoid the incorporation of the sacred JAH into the name of a bad man is too fanciful, the more so as Abijam was by no means an exceptionally bad king. It is, however, approved by Bahr and Rawlinson. But it is as little probable that Abijam is the original form of the name (Keil).

Compare the fuller account of this expedition in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-9</a>. Shishak (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;) was the first king of the twenty-second (or Bubastitic) dynasty, called Sesonchis in Jul. Afric., Sesonchosis in Eusebius, and upon the monuments on which Champollion first deciphered his name, Sheshonk or Sheshenk. Shishak has celebrated his expedition against Judah by a bas-relief on the outer wall of the pillar-hall erected by him in the first palace at Karnak, in which more than 130 figures are led in cords by Ammon and the goddess Muth with their hands bound upon their backs. The lower portion of the figures of this long row of prisoners is covered by escutcheons, the border of which being provided with battlements, shows that the prisoners are symbols of conquered cities. About a hundred of these escutcheons are still legible, and in the names upon them a large number of the names of cities in the kingdom of Judah have been deciphered with tolerable certainty.<p>(Note: Compare Max Duncker, Gesch. des Alterthums, Bd. i. p. 909, ed. 3, and for the different copies of this bas-relief in the more recent works upon Egypt, Reutschi in Herzog's Cycl. (art. Rehoboam). The latest attempts at deciphering are those by Brugsch, Geogr. Inschriften in den gypt. Denkmltern, ii. p. 56ff., and O. Blau, Sisaqs Zug gegen Juda aus dem Denkmale bei Karnak erlutert, in the Deutsch. morgenl. Ztschr. xv. p. 233ff. Champollion's interpretation of one of these escutcheons, in his Prcis du systme hierogl. p. 204, viz., Juda hammalek, "the king of Judah," has been rejected by Lepsius and Brugsch as philologically inadmissible. Brugsch writes the name thus: Judh malk or Joud-hamalok, and identifies Judh with Jehudijeh, which Robinson (Pal. iii. p. 45) supposes to be the ancient Jehud (<a href="/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>). This Jehud in the tribe of Dan, Blau (p. 238) therefore also finds in the name; and it will not mislead any one that this city is reckoned as belonging to the tribe of Dan, since in the very same chapter (<a href="/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>) Ajalon is assigned to Dan, though it was nevertheless a fortress of Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>). But Blau has not given any explanation of the addition malk or malok, whereas Gust. Roesch takes it to be &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, and supposes it to mean "Jehud of the king, namely, of Rehoboam or of Judah, on account of its being situated in Dan, which belonged to the northern kingdom." But this is certainly incorrect. For where could the Egyptians have obtained this exact knowledge of the relation in which the tribes of the nation of Israel stood to one another?)<p>Shishak was probably bent chiefly upon the conquest and plundering of the cities. But from Jerusalem, beside other treasures of the temple and palace, he also carried off the golden shields that had been made by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>), in the place of which Rehoboam had copper ones made for his body-guard. The guard, &#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, runners, are still further described as &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "who kept the door of the king's house," i.e., supplied the sentinels for the gate of the royal palace.</body></html>
