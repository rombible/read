The guilt, indeed, of Jeroboam’s act was enhanced by the presumptuous contempt of the special promise of God, given on the sole condition of obedience. In respect of this, perhaps, he is said below—in an expression seldom used elsewhere—to have “cast God Himself behind his back.” But probably the reference is mainly to the unprecedented effect of the sin, coming at a critical point in the history of Israel, and from that time onward poisoning the springs of national faith and worship. Other idolatries came and passed away: this continued, and at all times “made Israel to sin.”<p><span class= "bld">Other gods and molten images.</span>—See in <a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm" title="And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.">1Kings 11:28</a> the repetition of the older declaration in the wilderness, “These be thy gods, O Israel.” Jeroboam would have justified the use of the calves as simply emblems of the true God; Ahijah rejects the plea, holding these molten images, expressly forbidden in the Law, to be really objects of worship—“other gods,”—as, indeed, all experience shows that such forbidden emblems eventually tend to become. Moreover, from <a href="/1_kings/14-15.htm" title="For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.">1Kings 14:15</a> it appears that the foul worship of the <span class= "ital">Asherah</span> (“groves”) associated itself with the idolatry of Jeroboam.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm" title="But have done evil above all that were before you: for you have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:">1 Kings 14:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">But hast done evil above all that were before thee — </span>Above all the judges and former kings of my people, none of whom set up images, and persuaded the people to worship them. <span class="ital">For thou hast made thee other gods, and molten images — </span>Namely, the golden calves: not as if they thought them to be other gods in a proper sense, but only representations of the true God; for it is apparent they still pretended to worship the God of their fathers; but because God rejected their whole worship, and, howsoever they accounted it, he reckoned it a manifest defection from him, and a betaking themselves to <span class="ital">other gods, </span>or <span class="ital">devils, </span>as they are called <a href="/2_chronicles/11-15.htm" title="And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>, whom alone they served and worshipped therein, whatsoever pretences they had to the contrary. <span class="ital">To provoke — </span>Whereby thou didst provoke me.

Ahijah foretells the speedy death of the child then sick, in mercy to him. He only in the house of Jeroboam had affection for the true worship of God, and disliked the worship of the calves. To show the power and sovereignty of his grace, God saves some out of the worst families, in whom there is some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel. The righteous are removed from the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. It is often a bad sign for a family, when the best in it are buried out of it. Yet their death never can be a loss to themselves. It was a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by which both ought to have been instructed. God also tells the judgments which should come upon the people of Israel, for conforming to the worship Jeroboam established. After they left the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, but one undermined and destroyed another. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin. If great men do wickedly, they draw many others, both into the guilt and punishment. The condemnation of those will be severest, who must answer, not only for their own sins, but for sins others have been drawn into, and kept in, by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Above all that were before thee - i. e., above all previous rulers of the people, whether Judges or kings.

She was to go to Shiloh disguised, so as not to be recognised, to deceive the old prophet, because otherwise Jeroboam did not promise himself any favourable answer, as he had contemptuously neglected Ahijah's admonition (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-38.htm">1 Kings 11:38-39</a>). But he turned to this prophet because he had spoken concerning him &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, to be king, i.e., that he would become king, over this people. &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498; stands for &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, with which the infinitive esse can be omitted (vid., Ewald, 336, b.). As this prophecy, which was so favourable to Jeroboam, had come to pass (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-30</a>), he hoped that he might also obtain from Ahijah a divine revelation concerning the result of his son's illness, provided that he did not know who it was who came to seek counsel concerning her sick son. To complete the deception, she was to take with her as a present for the prophet (cf., <a href="/1_samuel/9-8.htm">1 Samuel 9:8</a>) "ten loaves and crumbs" and a jar with honey, i.e., a trifling gift such as a simple citizen's wife might take.
