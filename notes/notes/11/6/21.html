The amount of gold employed is given in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-8.htm" title="And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.">2 Chronicles 3:8</a> as six hundred talents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he made a partition by the chains of gold</span>] Render with R.V. <span class="bld">and he drew across</span> chains of gold. The words literally signify ‘he caused to pass over with chains,’ i.e. he made with chains of gold something that went across either the whole of the dividing wall or over the doorway which was made therein. From <a href="/2_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And the greater house he paneled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.">2 Chronicles 3:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/3-16.htm" title="And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.">2 Chronicles 3:16</a> it seems as if chains had been used for ornamentation on other parts of the walls and pillars.

As the clause stands, the word must refer to the oracle. Thus in the beginning of the verse ‘the house within’ will refer to the holy place, and this last clause to the most holy place. This is further emphasized by the words which immediately follow in 21. ‘And the whole house he overlaid.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And</span>.

Bahr says, the boards of the cedar partition, just as the bars fastened together the boards of the tabornacle (<a href="/exodus/26-26.htm">Exodus 26:26-29</a>). Gesen. himself (together with Keil, marg., <span class="accented">al</span>.) understands the doors, "he bolted the doors of the oracle," so as to keep them closed, except on the day of atonement. But the literal rendering is, "he carried over with chains of gold before the oracle," where nothing is said of either boards or doors. The more natural interpretation, therefore, would perhaps be: he carried on the gold plates of the house in chains of gold across the partition, and so fastened it to the side walls. Perhaps this was done to avoid any fracture of, or insertion into, the stonework]; <span class="cmt_word">and he overlaid it</span> [What? Keil says, the cedar altar last mentioned at the end of ver. 20. But the altar has now dropped out of the reader's, and therefore presumably out of the writer's mind. It would be more natural to understand the words of the oracle just mentioned, but the adornment of the oracle has already been related (ver. 20), and it is hardly likely that having stated that it was covered with <span class="accented">pure gold</span> in one verse, he would mention that it was overlaid with <span class="accented">gold</span> in the next.

The whole of the inside of the house was covered with wood, so that nothing was to be seen of the stone wall (<a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a>). On the other hand, the biblical text knows nothing of any covering of the outer walls also with wood, as many have assumed.</body></html>
