Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fir-tree - Rather, juniper (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a> note).

The first verb is that which has been rendered <span class="bld">overlaid</span> all through the narrative. So consistency requires the same rendering here. In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-6.htm" title="And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.">2 Chronicles 3:6</a> we read that precious stones, as well as gold, were used for adorning the walls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon the carved work</span>] This is not a word connected with that so frequently used for ‘carving’ in these verses. So the R.V. has given <span class="bld">graven work</span> to mark the variation. There is no doubt that the figures on the doors were cut in the wood and in English ‘graven-work’ refers generally to metal. But see <a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm" title="Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god that cannot save.">Isaiah 45:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>, where <span class="ital">graven</span> images appear to have been of wood, and destructible by burning. The description here given appears to mean that the embossed and carved portions of the woodwork were covered with gold, but not the whole surface of the doors.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers</span> [The constant recurrence of the same forms is in  itself a proof that they must have been significant], <span class="cmt_word">and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">made straight upon the engraved work.</span> That is to say, the gold fitted closely to all the uneven and indented surface of the figures.

All the walls of the house (the Holy Place and the Most Holy) round about (&#1502;&#1505;&#1489;, adverb) he made engraved work (carving) of cherubs, palms, and open flowers from within to the outside (i.e., in the Most Holy as well as in the Holy Place). &#1493;&#1500;...&#1502;&#1503;  equals  &#1488;&#1500;...&#1502;&#1503;; and &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>. This completes the account of the nature of the covering of wood. In addition to the oval figures and open flowers (<a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a>), there were also figures of cherubim and palm-trees carved in the wooden panels. Nothing is said as to the distribution of these figures. But a comparison with <a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> shows at any rate so much, that the palm-trees alternated with the cherubs, so that there was always one cherub standing between two palm-trees. The gourd-shaped figures and the open flowers probably formed the upper and lower setting of the rows of palms and cherubs, the flowers hanging in the form of garlands above the palms and cherubs, and the rows of gourds arranged in bars constituting the boundary lines both above and blow. It is a disputed question whether there was only one row of palms and cherubs running round the walls, or whether there were two, or possibly even three. There is more probability in the second or third of these assumptions than in the first, inasmuch as on the walls of the Egyptian temples there were often three or four rows of mythological characters in relief arranged one above another (compare my work on the Temple, pp. 70ff.).</body></html>
