It was very seasonable, being designed: first, to encourage him to go on with the building, by confirming anew the promise made to his father David (2Sa 7:12-16); and secondly, to warn him against the pride and presumption of supposing that after the erection of so magnificent a temple, he and his people would always be sure of the presence and favor of God. The condition on which that blessing could alone be expected was expressly stated. The dwelling of God among the children of Israel refers to those symbols of His presence in the temple, which were the visible tokens of His spiritual relation to that people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will dwell among the children of Israel,....

"A door (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, a opening for the entrance) to the middle side chamber (of the lower story) was on the right side (the southern side) of the house, and a winding staircase led up into the middle (room of the middle story) and out of the middle into the third rooms," i.e., the rooms of the third story. This is the rendering according to the Masoretic text; and the only thing that appears strange is the use of &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492; first of all for the middle room of the lower story and then for the middle story; and the conjecture is a very natural one, that the first &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492; may have been an error of the pen for &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, in which case &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506; does not signify the side room, but is used in a collective sense for the row of side rooms in one story, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-9.htm">Ezekiel 41:9</a>,<a href="/ezekiel/41-11.htm">Ezekiel 41:11</a>. That this door was made from the outside, i.e., in the outer wall of the side building, and did not lead into the side rooms "from the interior of the Holy Place," would hardly need a remark, if Bttcher (Proben alttestl. Schrifterkl. p. 339) and Schnaase (Gesch. der bildenden Knste, Bd. 1) had not really supported this view, which is so thoroughly irreconcilable with the dignity of the sanctuary.<p>(Note: The perfectly groundless assumption of Thenius, that the outer building had most probably an inner door as well, which connected it with the temple, does just as much violence to the decorum of the Holy Place.)<p>The only question is, whether it was made in the middle of the right side or in the front by the side of the porch. If the Masoretic text is correct, there is no doubt about the former. But if we read &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, the text leaves the question undecided. The winding staircase was not constructed in the outer wall itself, because this was not thick enough for the purpose, and the text states pretty clearly that it led from the lower story into the middle one, and thence still higher, so that it was in the centre of the building.</body></html>
