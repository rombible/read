In the LXX., 440 is read for 480, possibly by an interchange of two similar Hebrew letters, or, perhaps, by reckoning from the completion of Exodus at the death of Moses instead of its beginning. The Vulgate agrees with the Hebrew text. Josephus, on the other hand, without any hint of any other reckoning in the Scriptural record, gives 592 years. The date itself, involving some apparent chronological difficulties, has been supposed to be an interpolation; but without any sufficient ground, except Josephus’s seeming ignorance of its existence, and some early quotations of the passage by Origen and others without it; and in neglect of the important fact that, disagreeing <span class= "ital">prima fâcie </span>with earlier chronological indications in Scripture, it is infinitely unlikely to have been thus interpolated by any mere scribe.<p>These indications are, however, vague. The period includes the conquest and rule of Joshua, the era of the Judges down to Samuel, the reigns of Saul and David, and the three years of Solomon’s reign already elapsed. Now, of these divisions, only the last three can be ascertained with any definiteness, at about 83 years. The time occupied by the conquest and rule of Joshua, cannot be gathered with any certainty from Scripture. The same is the case with the duration of some of the subsequent Judgeships. Even the numerous chronological notices given in the Book of Judges are inconclusive. We cannot tell whether they are literally accurate, or, as the recurrence of round numbers may seem to suggest, indefinite expressions for long periods; nor can we determine how far the various Judgeships were contemporaneous or successive. The tradition followed by St. Paul (<a href="/context/acts/13-19.htm" title="And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.">Acts 13:19-21</a>), assigning to the whole a period of 450 years, agrees generally with the latter idea. The genealogies given (as, for example, of David, in <a href="/context/ruth/4-18.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-3.htm" title="The sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah: which three were born to him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess. And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the LORD; and he slew him.">1Chronicles 2:3-15</a>, and elsewhere) agree with the former. Hence, these vague chronological statistics cannot constitute <span class= "bld">a </span>sufficient ground for setting aside a date so formally and unhesitatingly given at an important epoch of the history, corresponding to the equally formal determination of the date of the Exodus in <a href="/context/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40-41</a>. The omission of the date in quotations, again, proves little. The different date given by Josephus, without any notice of that which we now have, presents the only real difficulty. But it is possible that he may have been inclined tacitly to harmonise his chronology with some other reckoning known in his time among the heathen; and in any case it is doubtful whether his authority can outweigh that of our present text and the ancient versions. On the whole, therefore, the grounds assigned for rejection of the chronological notice of this verse, are insufficient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.">1 Kings 6:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the four hundred and eightieth year — </span>Allowing forty years to Moses, seventeen to Joshua, two hundred and ninety-nine to the Judges, forty to Eli, forty to Samuel and Saul, forty to David, and four to Solomon before he began the work, we have just the sum of four hundred and eighty. So long it was before that holy house was built, which in less than four hundred and thirty years was burned by Nebuchadnezzar. It was thus deferred, because Israel had, by their sins, made themselves unworthy of this honour: and because God would show how little he values external pomp and splendour in his service. And God ordered it now, chiefly to be <span class="ital">a shadow of good things to come. In the fourth year of Solomon’s reign </span>— Solomon was occupied more than three years in making the necessary preparations; for although, his father had amassed much treasure, had left him a plan, and provided many things necessary for the undertaking, yet as these materials, it appears, lay at a considerable distance, and were left rude and unfashioned, it could not cost less time to form them into the exact symmetry in which the Scripture represents them to have been before they were used, and to bring them together to Jerusalem. <span class="ital">In the month Zif</span> — The second of the ecclesiastical year.

This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God. Thus the kingdom of God in the heart of man grows up in silence, Mr 5:27.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the four hundred and eightieth year - It is upon this statement that all the earlier portion of what is called the "received chronology" depends. Amid Minor differences there is a general agreement, which justifies us in placing the accession of Solomon about 1000 B.C. (1018 B.C. Oppert.) But great difficulties meet us in determining the sacred chronology anterior to this. Apart from the present statement, the chronological data of the Old Testament are insufficient to fix the interval between Solomon's accession and the Exodus, since several of the periods which make it up are unestimated. Hence, chronologists have based entirely the "received chronology" upon this verse. But the text itself is not free from suspicion.<p>(1) it is the sole passage in the Old Testament which contains the idea of dating events from an era.<p>(2) it is quoted by Origen without the date, and seems to have been known only in this shape to Josephus, to Theophilus of Antioch, and to Clement of Alexandria.<p>(3) it is hard to reconcile with other chronological statements in the Old and New Testament.<p>Though the books of Joshua, Judges, and Samuel furnish us with no exact chronology, they still supply important chronological data - data which seem to indicate for the interval between the Exodus and Solomon, a period considerably exceeding 480 years. For the years actually set down amount to at least 580, or, according to another computation, to 600; and though a certain deduction might be made from this sum on account of the round numbers, this deduction would scarcely do more than balance the addition required on account of the four unestimated periods. Again, in the New Testament, Paul (according to the received text) reckons the period from the division of Canaan among the tribes in the sixth year of Joshua Jos 14:1-15, to Samuel the prophet, at 450 years, which would make the interval between the Exodus and the commencement of the temple to be 579 years. On the whole, it seems, therefore, probable that the words "in the four hundred and eightieth year, etc.," are an interpolation into the sacred text, which did not prevail generally before the third century of our era. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>1Ki 6:1-4.

It may suffice at present to suggest these particulars: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That <span class="ital">Israel’s coming out of Egypt</span> is variously understood in Scripture, and with some latitude, so as not only to note the time when first they came out of Egypt, but the time of their being in or coming out of the wilderness; as is manifest from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/4-45.htm" title="These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.">Deu 4:45</a></span>, where the words in the Hebrew are not <span class="ital">after</span>, &c., as we translate it, but <span class="ital">in their coming forth out of Egypt</span>; and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/psalms/94-1.htm" title="O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs; O God, to whom vengeance belongs, show yourself....">Psalm 94:1-3</a></span>, <span class="ital">When Israel came forth</span> &c., Heb. <span class="ital">their coming forth</span> &c. And it is not impossible it may be so understood here, <span class="ital">after they were come out</span>&c., to wit, completely, i.e. towards the end of their expedition out of Egypt into Canaan. Nor doth the difference between the Hebrew prepositions <span class="ital">lamed</span> and <span class="ital">beth</span>, which a learned man objects, hinder this sense; for as <span class="ital">beth</span> signifies (as he saith) <span class="ital">after</span>, so also doth lamed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/7-4.htm" title="For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.">Genesis 7:4</a>,10 Num 33:38</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That whereas the times of the judges do chiefly cause this difficulty, there are many things which will relieve us therein; as, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That divers of the years there mentioned belong to one and the same time, as is evident from Jair’s twenty-two years, within which fell out, as divers learned chronologers agree, the eighteen years of the oppression of the Ammonites, and several years of the Philistine tyranny, who oppressed Israel in the west, whilst the Ammonites vexed them in the east; and the like might be observed in other cases. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That the years of rest are not necessarily to be understood of so many distinct years, besides those of war and servitude; and those words which are generally rendered <span class="ital">the land had rest forty or eighty years</span>, or the like, may be thus rendered, and that very agreeable to the Hebrew, <span class="ital">The land had rest</span>, or <span class="ital">began to rest</span>, or recovered its rest, <span class="ital">in the fortieth or in the eightieth</span> (the cardinal numbers being frequently put for the ordinal, especially where the number exceeds ten) <span class="ital">year</span>, to be computed from some remarkable time; and so that phrase doth not note how long time, or till what time, the rest continued, but at what time it began. As for instance, in <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/3-11.htm" title="And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.">Judges 3:11</a></span>, <span class="ital">the land had rest</span>, not <span class="ital">forty years</span>, as it is in our translation, but <span class="ital">in the fortieth year</span>, to wit, from and after their first rest in, or quiet possession of, the land of Canaan, which Joshua gave them; which time may very probably be made up of the days of Joshua, after he had settled them in a state of rest; and of the elders that outlived him, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/2-7.htm" title="And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.">Judges 2:7</a></span>, and the time of their corruption after the death of those elders; and the eight years of servitude under the king of Mesopotamia. So <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/3-30.htm" title="So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.">Judges 3:30</a></span>, <span class="ital">The land had rest in the eightieth year</span>, to wit, from and after that rest which Othniel obtained for them, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/3-11.htm" title="And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.">Judges 3:11</a></span>. And <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.">Judges 5:31</a></span>, <span class="ital">It rested in the fortieth year</span>, to wit, after that rest got by Ehud, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/3-30.htm" title="So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.">Judges 3:30</a></span>. And <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/8-28.htm" title="Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.">Judges 8:28</a></span>, <span class="ital">It rested in the fortieth year</span>, to wit, from the last rest got by Deborah. And thus the computation of years is more plain and certain, being thus made from rest to rest, than theirs that proceed the other way. And this is the more considerable, because it was the opinion of that fatuously learned and pious bishop of Armagh. All which considered, it will be very easy to contain all the parts and passages of sacred story, from the coming out of Egypt to this time, within the compass of four hundred and eighty years; of the several parcels whereof, see my Latin Synopsis. And as for other scriptures, which some conceit to be contradictory to this, I shall by God’s help vindicate them in their several places. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the fourth year of Solomon’s reign; </span> his three first years being spent partly in settling the affairs of his kingdom, without which neither civil nor ecclesiastical concerns could have any consistency; and partly in making necessary preparations for the work. <span class="bld">He began to build; </span> for so it is expressed <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.">2 Chronicles 3:1</a></span>; and so it is explained here below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/6-37.htm" title="In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:">1 Kings 6:37</a></span>, <span class="ital">The foundation of the house was laid</span>; though in the Hebrew it be only <span class="ital">be built</span>.

The LXX. has ‘the four hundred and fortieth year’, and Josephus ‘the five hundred and ninety second.’ If we put together the numbers which we find in the Old Testament record, we have 40 years between the Exodus and the death of Moses, 40 years peace after Othniel, 80 after Ehud; Jabin’s oppression lasted 20 years, there were 40 years of peace after Barak, 40 in Gideon’s time: Tola judged the land 23 years, Jair 22, Jephthah 6, Ibzan 7, Elon 10, Abdon 8: the servitude to the Philistines lasted 40 years, and Samson judged 20 years. After this we have as dates Eli 40 years, Samuel 20 (<a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, while the ark stayed in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.">1 Samuel 7:2</a>) at least, David 40, Solomon 4. These make a total of 498. But we cannot be sure that some of these judgeships were not contemporary with or overlapping one another, while there is no time specified for the duration of Joshua’s leadership, and for the events between his death and the judgeship of Othniel, nor yet again for the reign of Saul. So that it is utterly hopeless to settle any chronology under such circumstances. Moreover the frequent occurrence of the round number 40 gives the impression that no attempt has been made to fix accurate dates for any of the periods mentioned. Then in <a href="/judges/11-26.htm" title="While Israel dwelled in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did you not recover them within that time?">Jdg 11:26</a> we read that from the conquest of Gilead down to the time of Jephthah was 300 years.

Rec.</span> there elapsed, between the partition of the land under Joshua and the days of Samuel, a period of 450 years. Adding to this the other numbers and 40 years for the reign of Saul, according to the chronology which St Paul used, we reach a total of 554. But we have no data whereby to confirm or contradict any of these totals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is most likely that the 440 years of the LXX. was arrived at by adding together the years assigned to the several judges and omitting the other events, the oppression of Jabin, and of the Philistines. This makes a total 206 years, which with 40 years for the sojourn in the desert, and 104 between Eli and the 4th year of Solomon brings the total to 440.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Origen on <a href="/john/2-20.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?">John 2:20</a> quotes from this verse and omits the words which refer to the time between the Exodus and the building of the Temple. Yet as these words are represented in the LXX. but would have given no point to Origen’s comment, it appears more probable that he omitted them on purpose, than that, since his day, these words have been added to the Massoretic text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign</span>] This accounts for the mention in the LXX., at the end of the last chapter, that they spent three years in preparing the stone and timber.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the month Zif</span>] This name for the month is found only here and in <a href="/1_kings/6-37.htm" title="In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:">1 Kings 6:37</a> below. So that it appears not to have been the usual one. The word means ‘brightness’, ‘splendour’, and the Targum explains it of ‘the bloom of flowers’ at the time. It is said to have been between the new moon of May and that of June, though some place it a month earlier. A later name, Iyar, for the second month is found in the Targum on <a href="/2_chronicles/30-2.htm" title="For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>, and Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. viii. 3. 1) gives it as <span class="greekheb">Ἰάρ</span> here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he</span> began <span class="ital">to build</span>] This is a translation required by the sense. The Hebrew says simply ‘he built.’ In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>, the Hebrew is expressly ‘he began to build.’ Hence the rendering here.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt</span> [This date has been the subject of much controversy, which cannot even now be considered (<span class="accented">pace</span> Keil: "The correctness of the number 480 is now pretty generally admitted") as closed. Grave doubts are entertained as to its genuineness. Lord A. Hervey (Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 22) says it is "manifestly erroneous." Rawlinson considers it to be "an interpolation into the sacred text" (p. 515). And it is to he observed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> that the LXX. reads 440 instead of 480 years - a discrepancy which is suspicious, and argues some amount of incertitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Origen quotes this verse without these words (Comm. in S.

It is admitted that we have no other instance in the Old Testament where this is done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> It is difficult to reconcile this statement with other chronological notices both of the Old and New Testaments. For taking the numbers which we find in the Hebrew text of the books which refer to this period, they sum up to considerably more than 480 years. The time of the Judges alone comprises 410 years at the least. It should be stated, however, with regard to the <span class="accented">chronology</span> of the period last mentioned <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it only pretends to furnish round numbers - 20, 40, and the like - and evidently does not aim at exactitude; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is good ground for suspecting that the periods are not always consecutive; that in some cases, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they overlap. We are not justified, therefore, because of the dates of the Judges in rejecting this statement. The question of New Testament chronology is somewhat more complicated. In <a href="/acts/13-20.htm">Acts 13:20</a>, St. Paul states the period between the division of Canaan, by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1, 2</a>), and the time of Samuel the prophet as 450 years (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>) But Lachmann, on the authority <span class="accented">of</span> A, B, C (and we may add <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>), considers the received text to be corrupt, and would place <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> Alford, however, treats this reading as "an attempt at correcting the difficult chronology of the verse," and says that "all attempts to reconcile" it with <a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> "are arbitrary and forced." If, then, the received text is to stand - and it is to be noticed that the reigns of the Judges, including Samuel, sum up exactly to the period mentioned by St. Paul, 450 years - the interval between the Exodus and the erection of the temple cannot well have been less than 99 or 100 years longer, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, 580 - Josephus makes it  592 - instead of 480 years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The chronology of Josephus - to which by itself, perhaps, no great weight is to be attached, agrees with St. Paul's estimate, and of course contradicts that of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> Nor does it seem to be a valid argument for the retention of the suspected words, that "the precision of the statement is a voucher for its accuracy." (Bahr, who adds, "Not only is the whole number of the years given, but also the year of the reign of the king, and even the month itself," for the genuineness of the later date, "<span class="accented">In the fourth year,"</span> etc., is not questioned.) The remark of Keil that the building of the temple marked a new and important epoch in the history of the chosen people, and so justified an exceptional reference to the birth or emancipation of the nation, though undoubtedly true, will hardly avail much against the considerations alleged above. On the whole, therefore, I confess to the belief that these words are the interpolation of a later hand (of which we shall find traces elsewhere), though it would, perhaps, be premature, with only the evidence now before us, to exclude them from the text. It is certainly noteworthy that such destructive critics as Ewald and Thenius are satisfied as to their genuineness], <span class="cmt_word">in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel</span> [according to the chronology of Ussher, this was A.M. 3000], <span class="cmt_word">in the month Zif</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, May. The word signifies <span class="accented">splendour</span>. The month was probably so called because of the brilliancy of its flowers (Gesen., Keil, al.)], <span class="cmt_word">which is the second month</span> [This explanation is added because before the captivity the months (with the exception of <span class="accented">Abib</span>) appear to have had no regular names, but were almost always designated by numbers.

Only four pre-captivity names are recorded, and of these three are mentioned in connexion with the building of the temple, viz., <span class="accented">Zif</span> here and in ver. 37, <span class="accented">Bul</span> in ver. 38, and <span class="accented">Ethanim</span> in <a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>. It has hence been inferred that these names were not in general use, but were restricted to public documents, etc. (Dict. Bib. if. 416), a supposition which, if correct, would account for the facility with which the old appellations were superseded by post-captivity names. The later name for this month was <span class="accented">Iyar</span> (Targum on <a href="/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">that he began</span> [not in Heb.] <span class="cmt_word">to build the house of</span> [Heb. to] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>. [The chronicler mentions the site (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>), "In Mount Moriah ....in the threshing floor of Ornan," etc. We know from the extensive foundations yet remaining that the preparation of the platform on which the temple should stand must have been a work of considerable time and labour, and see Jos., Ant. 8:03.9, and Bell. Jud. 5:05.1. We can hardly be wrong in identifying the remarkable rock known as the <span class="accented">Sakrah</span>, over which the mosque of Omar (<span class="accented">Kubbet-es-Sakrah</span>) is built - the "pierced rock" of the Jerusalem Itinerary - with the threshing floor of Ornan. The reader will find an interesting paper on the site of the temple in "Scribner's Monthly," vol. 11. pp. 257-272. According to Mr. Beswick, whose measurements and conclusions it gives, the <span class="accented">porch</span> stood on the <span class="accented">Sakrah. Mr.</span> Conder, however, urges strong reasons ("Tent Work," pp. 187-9) for placing the <span class="accented">Holy of Holies</span> on the rock. We should then "see the Holy House in its natural and traditional position on the top of the mountain; we see the courts descending on either side, according to the present slopes of the hill; we find the great rock galleries dropping naturally into their right places; and finally, we see the temple, by the immutability of Oriental custom, still a temple, and the site of the great altar still consecrated [?] by the beautiful little chapel <span class="cmt_word">of</span> the chain." But see Porteri. p. 125; Pal. Explor. p. 4, also pp. 342, 343; "Our Work in Palestine," chs. 8. and 9; "Recovery of Jerusalem," ch. 12.<span class="accented">, etc. Quot viatores, tot sententiae.</span>] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The tributary labourers out of Israel. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>. Solomon raised a tribute (&#1502;&#1505;, tribute-labourers, as in <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>) out of all Israel, i.e., out of the whole nation (not "out of the whole territory of Israel," as Ewald supposes), 30,000 men, and sent them up to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in rotation; one month they were on Lebanon (doing tribute work), two months at home (looking after the cultivation of their own ground). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, from &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, does not mean in tabulas referre, in support of which appeal is made to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>, though on insufficient ground, but ascendere fecit, corresponding to the German ausheben (to raise). He raised them out of the nation, to send the up Lebanon (cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>). These 30,000 Israelitish labourers must be distinguished from the remnants of the Canaanites who were made into tribute-slaves (<a href="/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a> and <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>). The latter are called &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1505;, tribute-slaves, in <a href="/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a> as in <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>. That the Israelites were not to render the service of bondsmen is evident from the fact, that they only rendered tribute for four months of the year, and were at home for eight months; and the use of the epithet &#1502;&#1505; is not at variance with this. For even if this word is applied elsewhere to the Canaanitish bondsmen (e.g., <a href="/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-28.htm">Judges 1:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/8-8.htm">2 Chronicles 8:8</a>), a distinction is decidedly made in our account of Solomon between &#1502;&#1505; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1505;, inasmuch as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>, after the Canaanitish bondsmen have been mentioned, it is expressly stated that "of Israel Solomon made no one a slave" (&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;). The 30,000 Israelitish tribute-servants are "to be thought of as free Israelites, who simply performed the less severe work of felling trees in fellowship with and under the direction of the subjects of Hiram _(see at <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>), according to the command of the king, and probably not even that without remuneration" (Thenius).
