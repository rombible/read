"And built them for it (the house - &#1500;&#1493; pointing back to &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;) into the hinder room, into the Most Holy." &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is more precisely defined by the apposition &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, and therefore denotes the Most Holy Place. But there is a doubt as to its derivation and true meaning. Aquila and Symmachus render it &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Jerome &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, or in the Vulg. oraculum, so that they derive it from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to speak; and Hengstenberg adopts this derivation in <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a> : &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, lit., that which is spoken, then the place where the speaking takes place. Most of the more recent commentators, on the other hand, follow the example of C. B. Michaelis and J. Simonis, and render it, after the Arabic, the hinder portion or back room, which is favoured by the antithesis &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the front sanctuary (<a href="/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>). The words of the text, moreover, are not to be understood as referring to a cedar wall in front of the Most Holy Place which rose to the height of twenty cubits, but to all four walls of the Most Holy Place, so that the wall which divided the hinder room from the Holy Place is not expressly mentioned, simply because it is self-evident. The words also imply that the whole of the hinder space of the house to the length of twenty cubits was cut off for the Most Holy Place, and therefore the party wall must also have filled the whole height of the house, which was as much as thirty cubits, and reached, as is expressly stated, from the floor to the roof. There remained therefore forty cubits of the house (in length) for &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the front palace, i.e., the Holy Place of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>). &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, anterior, formed from &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (cf. Ewald, 164, a.). - In <a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a> there is inserted in a circumstantial clause the statement as to the internal decoration of both rooms; and the further description of the Most Holy Place is given in <a href="/1_kings/6-19.htm">1 Kings 6:19</a>. "And cedar wood was (placed) against the house inside, sculpture of gourds (colocynthides) and open buds." &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; is in apposition to &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;, containing a more minute description of the nature of the covering of cedar. &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; signifies sculpture, half-raised work (basso relievo); not, however, "that kind of bas-relief in which the figures, instead of rising above the surface on which they are wrought, are simply separated from it by the chiselling out of their outlines, and their being then rounded off according to these outlines" (Thenius). For although the expression &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>) appears to favour this, yet "merely engraved work" does not harmonize with the decorations of the brazen stands in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm">1 Kings 7:31</a>, which are also called &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are figures resembling the &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, or wild gourds (<a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a>), i.e., oval ornaments, probably running in straight rows along the walls. &#1510;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; are open flower-buds; not hangings or garlands of flowers (Thenius), for this meaning cannot be derived from &#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1512; in the sense of loosening or setting free, so as to signify flowers loosened or set free ( equals  garlands), which would be a marvellous expression! The objection that, "flowers not yet opened, i.e., flower-buds, were not &#1510;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, but &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;," rests upon a false interpretation of the passage referred to.</body></html>
