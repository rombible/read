The wall of the Temple must have been very thick at the bottom, for at the height of five cubits a ledge was made of one cubit wide on which to rest the floor work of the middle chambers. Then after five cubits more, a similar ledge received the floor-beams of the third story, and then at the height of 15 cubits came a third ledge, or rebatement, on which the beams of the roof of the uppermost story were to be supported. The wall of the Temple (i.e. the holy place) then rose 15 cubits more, and in this space were the windows. If we allow two cubits for the thickness of this upper part of the wall, the foot of the Temple wall must have been five cubits thick. Each story of the side chambers was one cubit more in width than the one below it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for without</span> in the wall <span class="ital">of the house he made narrowed rests round about</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">for on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house</span>. ‘Rebatements’ is taken from the margin of the A.V., and is the technical word for these shoulders in the wall of the Temple on which the floors and roof of each story were to rest with one end, while the other end was built into the outer wall of this encircling frame of chambers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that</span> the beams <span class="ital">should not be fastened</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">should not have hold</span>. The Temple building was more sacred than these chambers, which were meant for the use, or habitation of the priests. Hence there must be no breach made in the wall of either the holy place or of the most holy place. We read of ‘a chamber’ attached to the Temple (the Hebrew word is not the same as is used here) in the account of Tobiah (<a href="/nehemiah/13-5.htm" title="And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.">Nehemiah 13:5</a>). The use of it had been for storing the meat-offerings, frankincense, the sacred vessels and the tithes-in-kind which were given to the Levites. We have ‘chambers’ in the house of the Lord also noticed in <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-20.htm" title="And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.">Jeremiah 36:20</a>.

According to Bahr, it was in order to preserve the great and costly stones of the temple intact; but others, with greater probability, hold that it was because it appeared unseemly to have the side chambers, which were for  semi-secular purposes (cubicles, perhaps), made an actual part of the sacred edifice. Anyhow, it is clear that the beams rested on ledges made in the walls; but whether in the temple wall only, or in the outer wall of the side structure also, is uncertain. The preceding sketch will not only illustrate the difference, but will help the reader to understand the description preceding. In drawing (1) rebatements are showed only in the temple or inner wall, In (2) they are showed in both walls. In (1) the edifice is represented with a fiat; in (2) with a span roof. Keil decides in favour of the first arrangement (1), and Bahr says somewhat positively, "The outer wall of the structure had no rests." In fact, he suggests that the whole of this side building may have been of wood. It must be admitted that we do know that there were rebatements in the wall A, whereas nothing is said as to the outer wall B. It may also be reasonably alleged that the considerations of fitness and sacredness which forbade the insertion of the beams into the sanctuary wall would not apply to the outer wall, which was a part of the side structure only. Against this view, however, may be urged the extreme thickness of wall which this method of building would necessitate. For unless we suppose that the floor of the ground story rested on the rock, and so was quite detached from the building, we must suppose four rebatements, so that if the wall at the top were two cubits wide, it would be no less than six cubits (or nine feet) at the bottom. It is true that the walls of ancient buildings were of extraordinary thickness, but it must also be remembered that the temple was not fifty feet high. However, <a href="/ezekiel/41-9.htm">Ezekiel 41:9</a> suggests that the outside wall (B) may have been five cubits in thickness, and, if so, the inner wall would hardly be less. Fergusson, therefore, has some justification for putting each wall down as five cubits wide; but on the whole, perhaps, the plan represented in (1) appears the more probable. The historian here digresses for a moment to speak of the remarkable and, indeed, unprecedented way in which the temple was built, The stories were shaped and prepared beforehand in the quarry, so that there was nothing to do on their arrival in the temple area but to fit them into their place in the building.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With <a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a> the account of the preparations for the building of the temple, which were the object of Solomon's negotiations with Hiram, is brought to a close. "Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders, even the Giblites, hewed and prepared the wood and the stones for the building of the house." The object to &#1497;&#1508;&#1505;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is not the square stones mentioned before, but the trees (beams) and stones mentioned after &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. &#1493;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is to be taken as explanatory, "even the Giblites," giving a more precise definition of "Hiram's builders." The Giblites are the inhabitants of the town of Gebal, called Byblos by the Greeks, to the north of Beirut (see at <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), which was the nearest to the celebrated cedar forest of the larger Phoenician towns. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>, the Giblites (Byblians) were experienced in the art of shipbuilding, and therefore were probably skilful builders generally, and as such the most suitable of Hiram's subjects to superintend the working of the wood and stone for Solomon's buildings. For it was in the very nature of the case that the number of the Phoenician builders was only a small one, and that they were merely the foremen; and this may also be inferred from the large number of his own subjects whom Solomon appointed to the work.<p>(Note: Without any satisfactory ground Thenius has taken offence at the word &#1493;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, and on the strength of the critically unattested &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; of the lxx and the paraphrastic &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; of Josephus, which is only introduced to fill in the picture, has altered it into &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, "they bordered them (the stones)." This he explains as relating to the "bevelling" of the stones, upon the erroneous assumption that the grooving of the stones in the old walls encircling the temple area, which Robinson (Pal. i. 423) was the first to notice and describe, "occurs nowhere else in precisely the same form;" whereas Robinson found them in the ancient remains of the foundations of walls in different places throughout the land, not only in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, viz., at Bethany, but also at Carmel on the mountains of Judah, at Hebron, Semua (Esthemoa), Beit Nusib (Nezib), on Tabor, and especially in the north, in the old remains of the walls of the fortification es Shukif, Hunn, Banias, Tyrus, Jebail (Byblus), Baalbek, on the island of Ruwad (the ancient Aradus), and in different temples on Lebanon (see Rob. Pal. ii. 101,198, 434,627; iii. 12,213, 214; and Bibl. Researches, p. 229). Bttcher (n. ex. Krit. Aehrenl. ii. p. 32) has therefore properly rejected this conjecture as "ill-founded," though only to put in its place another which is altogether unfounded, namely, that before &#1493;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; the word &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; ("the Tyrians") has dropped out. For this has nothing further in its favour than the most improbable assumption, that king Hiram gathered together the subjects of his whole kingdom to take part in Solomon's buildings. - The addition of &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;, which is added by the lxx at the end of the verse, does not warrant the assumption of Thenius and Bttcher, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; has dropped out of the text. For it is obvious that the lxx have merely made their addition e conjectura, and indeed have concluded that, as the foundation for the temple was laid in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, the preliminary work must have occupied the first three years of his reign.) </body></html>
