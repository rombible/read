But in standing before such a room as is here described, it is in front of you, and you see the interior. In this way ‘before the oracle’ may be taken to indicate what is seen when you stand there. Hence we may arrive at the sense in the R.V. ‘<span class="bld">within the oracle was</span> <span class="ital">a space</span> &c.’ It is difficult to assign any meaning to the A.V., and it may be that some error has crept into the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some have preferred to render literally thus, ‘And before the oracle—twenty cubits was it in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof, and he overlaid it with pure gold—he overlaid also the altar with cedar.’ But the accents of the Hebrew do not favour such a parenthetic clause, and the last sentence is very awkward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. (<span class="ital">Vat</span>.) omits at the beginning of the verse ‘before the oracle,’ then takes the next sentences as a specification of the size of the oracle, and makes an addition to the last clause thus, ‘and he made an altar before the oracle and overlaid it with gold,’ making no mention of the cedar at all. Most probably this represents the correct text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and so covered the altar</span> which was of <span class="ital">cedar</span>] We cannot, in the face of the preceding clause, translate otherwise than <span class="bld">and he covered an altar with cedar</span>. The construction in the two cases is identical. But then arises a difficulty. The altar in question was the altar of incense in the holy place. This stood in front of the vail which separated the most holy place (see <a href="/exodus/40-5.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-26.htm" title="And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil:">Exodus 40:26</a>), and in <a href="/ezekiel/41-22.htm" title="The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before the LORD.">Ezekiel 41:22</a> it is called ‘the altar of wood’ (cf. <a href="/context/exodus/30-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar to burn incense on: of shittim wood shall you make it....">Exodus 30:1-6</a>). From the description in the verse before us there must have been some substance underneath the wood. The LXX. (<span class="ital">Alex</span>.) solves the difficulty by reading ‘and he made’ for ‘and he covered,’ i.e. <span class="greekheb">ויעשׂ</span> for <span class="greekheb">ויצף</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐποίησε θυσιαστήριον κέδρου</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the oracle in the forepart</span> [or, <span class="accented">the interior</span> of the oracle. Keil, after Kimchi, maintains that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> is the construct of the noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

The A.V. yields no sense] <span class="cmt_word">was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof</span> [that is to say, it was a perfect cube. When we consider that the oracle of the tabernacle was a cube of ten cubits and the Holy City (<a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-35</a>, especially ver. 20) is a cube of 12,000 furlongs, we cannot but regard these measurements as significant. To the ancients the square seemed the most appropriate shape to express the idea of moral perfection. The idea of the cube consequently was that of entire completeness, of absolute perfection. A little light is thrown on this subject by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> among the Greeks. See the quotation from Simonides in Plat. Protag. 334 A; Arist. Rhet. 3:11; Eth. Nic. 1:10, 11, and compare the familiar "<span class="accented">totus teres atque rotundus."</span> The height of the oracle (internally) being only twenty cubits, while that of the house was thirty (ver. 2), several questions of some interest suggest themselves for consideration. It is perhaps  impossible in the present state of our knowledge to arrive at any very positive conclusions, but it may be well, nevertheless, if only to show in how much uncertainty the architecture of the temple is involved, to state them. First among them is this: Was the roof of the temple flat or ridged? (See above on ver. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In either case, was the height of thirty cubits, or any uniform height, maintained throughout, or was the roof of the oracle some ten cubits lower than that of the house? The analogy of the tabernacle, of which the temple was a copy, would lead us to suppose that the ridge - if there was a ridge - of the entire building was level and unbroken, though the analogy of the Gothic church, which, we have already seen, is almost a reproduction of the temple, suggests that the oracle (like the chancel, and, it may be added, like the <span class="accented">adytum</span> of Egyptian temples) may possibly have had a lower roof. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> supposing the same height was maintained from end to end, to what use, if any, was the vacant space of ten cubits (15 feet) between cieling and roof of oracle applied? It has been held by some that there was a chamber here, but that it was empty, being formed, in fact, not for use, but in order to procure the cubical shape of the oracle. Others contend that this upper room, or one which ran the entire length of the building, was designed to serve as a receptacle for the reliques of the tabernacle, and they would identify it with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. (LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>. And untrustworthy as Josephus is when not supported by independent evidence, it is worth mentioning here that beth he and the Talmud "persistently assert that there was a superstructure on the temple equal in height to the lower part" (Fergusson, who, consequently, is of opinion that there undoubtedly was some such superstructure, as in the tomb of Darius, near Persepolis (see Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1456, 1-457), and that it was used for worship (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>), where see note). Bahr, however, argues forcibly against this idea. He says, <span class="accented">inter alia</span>, that there was no approach provided to these chambers; but our account is so manifestly imperfect that this argument is at the best a precarious one. He sees in the "upper chambers" (the Hebrew word is plural) the upper stories of the side structure. He agrees, however, with Ewald that there was a chamber over the oracle, but thinks it was unoccupied. Keil identifies this space with the "upper chambers" of <a href="/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>, and upon the whole this appears to be the most feasible view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> How was the cieling, whether with or without this upper chamber, and whether at the height of twenty or thirty cubits - how was it supported? For "no cedar beam could be laid across a space of twenty cubits without sinking in the centre by its own weight." Fergusson hence argues that the roof must have been carried on pillars - four in the sanctuary and ten in the hall. He remarks that they were used in the house of the Forest of Lebanon, where they were <span class="accented">less</span> suitable than here]: <span class="cmt_word">and he overlaid it</span> [lit. <span class="accented">made it shine</span>] <span class="cmt_word">with pure gold</span> [marg. <span class="accented">shut up</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">clausit</span>). Cf. <a href="/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15</a> (Heb.) The same gold is described as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-8.htm">2 Chronicles 3:8</a>). It is called "shut up gold," not because it was <span class="accented">concealed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but because of the exclusion of impure ingredients (Vulg. <span class="accented">aurum purissimum</span>). The lavish use of gold in the interior of the temple - its weight 600 talents (75,000 lbs.), its value almost incalculable - was not for mere display (for most of it was never seen except by the priests), but was symbolical of light and <span class="accented">purity</span> (<a href="/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22, 23</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>), and stamped the place as the abode of Him who dwelleth in light (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc.</span> The palace of the Lord must be "exceeding magnifical." The overlaying was not gilding, but <span class="accented">laminae</span> of gold were attached to the woodwork with nails. This art was probably derived from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11, 13</a>). Egyptian figures ornamented with gold plates are found both in the Louvre and British Museum. See Wilkinson, "Ancient Egyptians," 2. p. 233 sqq.) Rawlinson remarks that "such ornamentation was common in Babylon, in Assyria, and in Media." See <a href="/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>; Herod. 1:98; Layard, 2:264. In addition to the gold, the house was garnished with precious stones (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>).

Alex. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), which proves that the Seventy had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> in their text. If so, the absence of the article is at once explained, and an unmeaning repetition in ver. 22 avoided. The mention of the altar - of course it is the altar of <span class="accented">incense</span> that is meant: the altar of burnt sacrifice was outside the building - in connexion with the  oracle is significant. In ver. 22 it is called the "altar that (belonged) to the oracle," because it stood just outside it. In the tabernacle it was placed "before the vail" (<a href="/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5, 26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-18</a>), and it occupied this position because the incense burned upon it was offered before the Invisible Presence within. It is an argument in favour of the textual emendation suggested above that the altar in the tabernacle was of wood (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>), and that Ezekiel speaks of the "altar of wood" (<a href="/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>), the altar of sacrifice being of earth stones (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24, 25</a>), or brass (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>) If we retain the Received Text we are almost compelled to believe that this altar was also of stone, as they would hardly cover a wooden altar with wood. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Internal Arrangements of the Temple-House. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14-22</a>.
