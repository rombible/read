The chambers on the ground-floor were possibly reached each by their own door in the outer wall of the lean-to. The middle and upper floors were reached by a single door in the right or south wall, from which a winding staircase ascended to the second tier, while another ascended from the second to the third. The door to the stairs was in the outer wall of the building, not in the wall between the chambers and the temple. That would have desecrated the temple far more than the insertion of beams. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building&#8212;A subterranean quarry has been very recently discovered near Jerusalem, where the temple stones are supposed to have been hewn. There is unequivocal evidence in this quarry that the stones were dressed there; for there are blocks very similar in size, as well as of the same kind of stone, as those found in the ancient remains. Thence, probably, they would be moved on rollers down the Tyropean valley to the very side of the temple [Porter, Tent and Kahn].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The door for the middle chamber, </span> i.e. by which they entered to go up to the middle chamber or chambers, to wit, such as were in the middle story. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the right side, </span> i.e. in the south side, called <span class="ital">the right side here</span>, and in the Hebrew text, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/89-12.htm" title="The north and the south you have created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your name.">Psalm 89:12</a></span>, and in other authors; because when a man looks towards the east, or sun-rising, which is esteemed the most glorious part of the heavens, and to which men most frequently look for divers reasons, the south is on his right hand; whereby it is implied that there was another door on the left, or the north side, leading to the chambers on that side, though for brevity sake it be not mentioned here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With winding stairs; </span> which were either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

That would be a matter of course, and there may have been more than one, but the place and way of reaching the other two flights of rooms did need notice.

That this emendation has much in its favour must be allowed, but it seems also certain that we get a perfectly clear meaning from the text as it stands, viz., that "the door (leading to) the middle floor was (on the ground floor) on the right side," etc. It is hardly likely that all the compartments on the ground floor had only one approach, and the doors which communicated with them may well have been passed over as requiring no special notice.
