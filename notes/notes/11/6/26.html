Christ is the true Temple. In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead; in him meet all God's spiritual Israel; through him we have access with confidence to God. 2. Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it. Let sinners come to Jesus as the living Foundation, that they may be built on him, a part of this spiritual house, consecrated in body and soul to the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two cherubims - The pattern of the tabernacle was followed (marginal reference), but without servile imitation. The original cherubs were entirely of gold. These, being so much larger, were of wood, merely overlaid with a golden plating. The arrangement of the wings, and the direction of the faces, seem also to have been different. Moses' cherubim "covered with their wings over the mercy seat;" Solomon's stretched out theirs to the full <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-27.htm">1 Kings 6:27</a>, so that the four wings, each five cubits long <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-24.htm">1 Kings 6:24</a>, extended across the whole sanctuary, the width of which was twenty cubits <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>. The former looked toward one another, and were bent downward toward the mercy-seat; the latter looked outward, toward the great chamber.

The word &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; I agree with Kimchi in regarding as the construct state of the noun &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which occurs again in <a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a> in the sense of the inner part or interior, as is evident from the antithesis &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1501; (on the outside). "And he overlaid it with fine gold." &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489; ( equals  &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1512;  equals ( &#1494; in <a href="/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15</a>) unquestionably signifies fine or costly gold, although the derivation of this meaning is still questionable; viz., whether it is derived from &#1505;&#1490;&#1512; in the sense of to shut up, i.e., gold shut up or carefully preserved, after the analogy of &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;; or is used in the sense of taking out or selecting, i.e., gold selected or pure; or in the sense of closed, i.e., gold selected or pure; or in the sense of closed, i.e., gold condensed or unadulterated (Frst and Delitzsch on <a href="/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15</a>).<p>The Most Holy Place had therefore the form of a perfect cube in the temple as well as in the tabernacle, only on an enlarged scale. Now, as the internal elevation of the house, i.e., of the whole of the temple-house, the hinder portion of which formed the Most Holy Place, was thirty cubits, there was a space of about ten cubits in height above the Most Holy Place and below the roof of the temple-house for the upper rooms mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>, on the nature and purpose of which nothing is said in the two accounts.<p>(Note: This upper room does not presuppose, however, that the party wall, which follows as a matter of course from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>, was not merely a cedar wall, but a wall two cubits thick. The supposed difficulty of setting up a cedar wall thirty cubits high is not so great as to necessitate assumptions opposed to the text. For we cannot possibly see why it could not have been made secure "without injuring the temple wall." The wood panelling must have been nailed firmly to the wall without injuring the wall itself; and therefore this could be done just as well in the case of the cedar beams or boards of the party wall.)<p>"And he overlaid (clothed) the altar with cedar wood." There is something very striking in the allusion to the altar in this passage, since the verse itself treats simply of the Most Holy Place; and still more striking is the expression &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, "the altar belonging to the Debir," in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, since there was no altar in the Most Holy Place. We cannot remove the strangeness of these sentences by such alterations as Thenius and Bttcher propose, because the alterations suggested are much too complicated to appear admissible. The allusion to the altar in both these verses is rather to be explained from the statements in the Pentateuch as to the position of the altar of incense; viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>, "Thou shalt place it before the curtain, which is above the ark of the testimony before the capporeth over the testimony;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, "before the ark of the testimony;" whereby this altar, although actually standing "before the inner curtain," i.e., in the Holy Place, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-26.htm">Exodus 40:26</a>, was placed in a closer relation to the Most Holy Place than the other two things which were in the Holy Place. The clothing of the altar with cedar presupposes that it had a heart of stone; and the omission of the article before &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495; may be explained on the ground that it is mentioned here for the first time, just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>, where &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; was first mentioned, it had no article.</body></html>
