As this was (see <a href="/context/exodus/27-9.htm" title="And you shall make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:">Exodus 27:9-13</a>) 50 cubits by 100, it may be inferred, that by a duplication similar to that of all dimensions of the Temple itself, Solomon’s Court was 100 cubits (or 150 feet) by 200 cubits (or 300 feet), covering a little more than an acre. The verse has been interpreted in two ways: either that the floor of the court was raised by three courses of stone, covered with a planking of cedar, or (as Josephus understands it) enclosed by a wall of three courses of stone, with a coping of cedar wood. The latter seems more probable. For in this court stood the altar of burnt offering and the laver, and all sacrifices went on, and this could hardly have been done on a wooden pavement; and besides this we observe that the whole arrangement is (<a href="/1_kings/7-12.htm" title="And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.">1Kings 7:12</a>) compared with that of the great outer court of the palace where the wooden pavement would be still more unsuitable. It was what was called afterwards the “Court of the Priests,” and in it (see <a href="/ezekiel/40-45.htm" title="And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.">Ezekiel 40:45</a>) appear to have been chambers for the priests.<p>The mention of the “inner court” suggests that there was an outer court also. We have in <a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm" title="And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.">2Kings 21:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>, a reference to the “two courts” of the Temple, and in <a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm" title="Then brought he me into the outward court, and, see, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were on the pavement.">Ezekiel 40:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-1.htm" title="Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-8.htm" title="For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, see, before the temple were an hundred cubits.">Ezekiel 42:8</a>, a mention of the “outward” or “utter court.” Josephus (Antt. viii. 3, § 3) declares that Solomon built beyond the inner court a great quadrangle, erected for it great and broad cloisters, and closed it with golden doors, into which all could enter, “being pure and observant of the laws.” Even beyond this he indicates, though in rather vague and rhetorical language, an extension of the Temple area, as made by Solomon’s great substructures, forming a court less perfectly enclosed, like the Court of the Gentiles in the later Temple. Of these outer courts and cloisters the tradition remained in the assignment of the title of “Solomon’s Porch” to the eastern cloister of the later Temple. It has been thought that in this outer court were planted trees (in spite of the prohibition of <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>); and this may have been the case, till the association of idol worship with them made these seem to be unfit for the House of the Lord. But the passages usually quoted to support this view are from the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/52-8.htm" title="But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-13.htm" title="Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.">Psalm 92:13</a>), of which the former certainly refers to the Tabernacle, and the latter may do so.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/6-36.htm" title="And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.">1 Kings 6:36</a></span>. <span class="ital">The inner court — </span>That wherein the priests officiated, (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-9.htm" title="Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.">2 Chronicles 4:9</a>,) so called because it was next to the temple, which it encompassed. <span class="ital">With three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams</span> <span class="ital">— </span>It is difficult to ascertain the precise meaning of the sacred historian here.

The inner court is probably identical with the "higher court" of Jeremiah Jer 36:10, being raised above the outer, as were sometimes the inner courts of Assyrian palaces. The court seems to have surrounded the temple. Its dimensions may be reasonably presumed to have been double those of the court of the tabernacle, i. e., 100 cubits on each side of the temple, and 200 cubits at the ends; or, about 720 feet long by 360 broad.<p>With three rows of hewed stone - Either a fence enclosing the court, or the area of the court, which was possibly formed by three layers of hewn stone placed one above the other, and was then boarded on the top with cedar planks. Such a construction would no doubt be elaborate; but if it was desired to elevate the inner court above the outer, this is the way in which it would be likely to have been done. The temple would be placed, like the Assyrian palaces, on an artificial platform; and the platform, being regarded as a part of the sacred building, would be constructed of the best material. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. the inner court&#8212;was for the priests.

And that a great number of buildings and rooms were necessary for the various offices and works which were to be done, and the treasures of all sorts which were to be laid up in the temple, largely so called, is sufficiently evident from the nature of the things, and divers passages in Scripture: see, among others, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm" title="Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>,12</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he built the inner court,....

There is some doubt as to how the description in this verse is to be understood. It seems clear from the passage in Jeremiah that the inner was on a higher level than the outer court. Some have thought that this elevation was made by three layers of stone and then a wooden planking put over all. But to do this for the whole enclosure would have been very laborious work and seemingly for no purpose. It seems better to take it that the elevation was artificially made, and then to understand the three rows of hewn stone, covered by one row of cedar wood at the top, to have made a sort of sunk fence all round the inner court. The people standing in the outer court would need to see what the priests were doing. This they would all be able to do if the wall of stone and cedar work were very little, if at all, higher than the level of the inner court.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - The description of the buildings concludes with a brief reference to the <span class="accented">enceinte</span> or court. <span class="cmt_word">And he built the inner court</span> [The mention of an <span class="accented">inner</span> court, called in <a href="/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a> the "court of the priests," presupposes, of course, the existence of an <span class="accented">outer</span> court. Our author does not mention this, but the chronicler does, under the name of "the great court." In <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, the former is called the "higher court," because it occupied a higher level] <span class="cmt_word">with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams.</span> [These, it is thought, formed the enclosing <span class="accented">wall</span> of the court (the LXX. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The cedar beams were instead of coping stones. It has been supposed, however (J.D. Michaelis), that these three rows of stone, boarded with cedar, formed the <span class="accented">pavement of</span> the court. But the question at once suggests itself, Why pile three rows of stones one upon another merely to form a pavement, and why hew and shape them if they were to be concealed beneath a stratum of wood? It is a fair inference from <a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>, that the wall was low enough to permit men to look over it. Fergusson, on the contrary, argues that it must have been <span class="accented">twice</span> the height of the enclosure of the tabernacle, which would give us an elevation of ten cubits (<a href="/exodus/27-18.htm">Exodus 27:18</a>). It is worth suggesting, however, whether, the inner court being raised above the outer, which surrounded it, these stones may not have formed the retaining wall or sides of the platform. As the outer court had gates (<a href="/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), it also must have had walls. From <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, we gather that there were various chambers in the forecourt. Such were certainly contemplated by David (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>); but it is not recorded that Solomon built them. Nor have we any warrant, except the bare assertion of Josephus, for the belief that he built a colonnade or cloister on the east side, such as was known to later ages by the name of "Solomon's Porch" (<a href="/john/10-23.htm">John 10:23</a>; <a href="/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>; <a href="/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>). As to the dimensions of these spaces, we are left to conjecture. If, as in everything else, the dimensions of the tabernacle were doubled, then the court of the priests would measure 200 cubits from east to west, and 100 cubits from north to south. It should be stated, however, that in the temple of Ezekiel, the proportions of which, in the present instance, may well he historical, both courts are represented as perfect squares. Rawlinson inadvertently puts down the length (along the side of temple) at 100 cubits, and the breadth (ends of temple) at 200. The outer court would probably be twice as large as the inner, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, 400 x 200 cubits.
