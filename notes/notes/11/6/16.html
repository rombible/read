The cedar-wood was beautifully embellished with figures in relievo, representing clusters of foliage, open flowers, cherubims, and palm trees. The whole interior was overlaid with gold, so that neither wood nor stone was seen; nothing met the eye but pure gold, either plain or richly chased.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Twenty cubits on the sides of the house, </span> i.e. the most holy place, which contained in the length of the house twenty cubits, by comparing this with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm" title="And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.">1 Kings 6:2</a>,17</span>, which may be said to be <span class="ital">on the sides of the house</span> because this part took off twenty cubits in length from each side of the house, and was also twenty cubits from side to side; so it was twenty cubits every way. <span class="ital">Or, on the sides</span> (i.e. on all the sides, as indeed it was) <span class="ital">of the house, or of that house</span>, to wit, the most holy place, as it here follows.

So it is not necessary, at least by virtue of these words, to understand this, as they generally do, that the floor itself was built with cedar; but only all the sides of it from the bottom twenty cubits upward. If it be said that the whole house, and consequently the most holy place, was thirty cubits high, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm" title="And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.">1 Kings 6:2</a></span>, it may be replied, either that that is true only of the greater house, or the holy place, which is called <span class="ital">the house</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/6-17.htm" title="And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.">1 Kings 6:17</a></span>, and that the lesser, or the most holy place, was but twenty cubits high, as divers think; or that the ten cubits at the top were covered with some other wood or thing, or were left open, that it might thereby receive both light from the candlesticks, and smoke from the altar of incense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the oracle, even for the most holy place, </span> i. e. that it might be the oracle, or <span class="ital">the most holy place</span>.

The word translated ‘sides’ is often used for the innermost part of anything, as of a cave (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm" title="And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately.">1 Samuel 24:4</a>), and of the recesses of a forest, as Lebanon (<a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm" title="By your servants have you reproached the Lord, and have said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.">Isaiah 37:24</a>). So here it signifies the innermost part of the Temple building as you looked from the porch, i.e. toward the farthest wall of the most holy place. The sense then becomes more manifest. He built at twenty cubits from this extreme end something with boards of cedar. Thus he made a separation of the most holy place, which was twenty cubits long, from the holy place. The R.V. gives this more clearly: ‘He built twenty cubits <span class="bld">on the hinder part of the house</span>’ with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls (‘beams’ LXX.), i.e. these twenty cubits were thus shut off and made into a separate room (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/3-8.htm" title="And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.">2 Chronicles 3:8</a>). There was a doorway for access in this cedarwood partition (see <a href="/1_kings/6-31.htm" title="And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.">1 Kings 6:31</a>), and before this probably were put the ‘chains of gold’ spoken of in <a href="/1_kings/6-21.htm" title="So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.">1 Kings 6:21</a>. From <a href="/2_chronicles/3-14.htm" title="And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and worked cherubim thereon.">2 Chronicles 3:14</a> it seems that there was a vail in front of the whole of this woodwork, though no mention of it is made here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is very difficult to come to a clear idea about the room here provided. It seems certain that it was enclosed on three sides by the chambers built round about, so that there could have been no windows in it, nor any mode of escape for the smoke of the incense, except by openings under the eaves. It appears not to have been as high as the roof of the ‘holy place’. We must remember that it was to be entered by one person only, and that but once a year.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he even built</span> them <span class="ital">for it within</span>] i.e. He prepared this space of twenty cubits in the innermost part of the house, to be a separate room.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>even <span class="ital">for the oracle</span>] The Hebrew says merely ‘for <span class="bld">an</span> oracle.’ This name for the most holy place is taken from the Vulgate ‘oraculum.’ The LXX. merely transliterates the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">δαβίρ</span>. The word is connected with the verb <span class="greekheb">דבר</span> (<span class="ital">davar</span>), usually rendered ‘to speak,’ and hence the notion of ‘oracle’ as the place where God revealed Himself. So Aquila and Symmachus rendered it sometimes by <span class="greekheb">χρηματιστήριον</span>, and Jerome gives <span class="greekheb">λαλητήριον</span> as an explanation. But the root, or its Arabic cognate, has a sense from which the meaning ‘hinder portion’ might come. Hence some consider the name merely as signifying the innermost part of the Temple building.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the most holy</span> place] Described in the same words in the account of the Tabernacle (<a href="/context/exodus/26-33.htm" title="And you shall hang up the veil under the clasps, that you may bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony: and the veil shall divide to you between the holy place and the most holy....">Exodus 26:33-34</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-4.htm" title="This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:">Numbers 4:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-19.htm" title="But thus do to them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach to the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:">Numbers 4:19</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he built twenty cubits on</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">from</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the sides of the house both the floor and the walls</span> [Heb. as in ver. 15, "from the floor to the walls" (or beams).

The height given must also be understood as referring to the height within. Consequently the side buildings had an internal height of 3 x 5 cubits, and reckoning the floorings and the roof of the whole building an external height of 18 or 20 cubits; so that the temple-house, which was thirty cubits high within and about thirty-two without, rose about twelve or fourteen cubits above the side building, and there was plenty of room for the windows in the side walls. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1494;: "and it (the side building) held to the house with cedar beams." The meaning is, that the building was fastened to the house by the joists of the cedar beams belonging to the different stories, which rested upon rebates of the temple wall, so that it was firmly attached to the temple-house, without any injurious insertions into the sanctuary itself. This is apparently the only explanation, that can be grammatically sustained, of words that have received such different interpretations. For the translation given by Thenius, which coincides with this, - viz., "he fastened it (each separate story of the building) to the temple-house with cedar wood, namely, with the cedar beams which formed the flooring and roofing of the three stores," - is exposed to this grammatical objection, that the suffix is wanting in &#1497;&#1506;&#1495;&#1494;, and that &#1488;&#1495;&#1494; is never followed by &#1488;&#1514; in the sense of with. All the other explanations are unsuitable. &#1497;&#1506;&#1495;&#1494; signifies neither "he covered the house" (Chald., Vulg., Luther), nor "he overlaid the house;" moreover, the roofing of the house has been already mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>, and there is no trace to be found of any overlaying or covering of the outside with cedar wood.<p>If, therefore, we reckon the thickness of the temple wall at six cubits, and that of the outer wall of the side building and the front wall of the porch at three cubits each, the whole building would be ninety-three cubits long (externally) and forty-eight cubits broad. The height of the temple-house was about thirty-two cubits externally, and that of the side stories from eighteen to twenty cubits, without the socle upon which the whole building rested. This is not mentioned indeed, as being a subordinate matter, but would certainly not be omitted.<p>(Note: Thenius, on the other hand, reckons the length of the whole building at a hundred cubits and its breadth at fifty-two, because, on the unfounded assumption that the temple in Ezekiel's vision was simply a copy of Solomon's temple, he sets down the thickness of the temple wall in front and along the two sides at six cubits, and that of the hinder wall at seven. Moreover, he not only reckons the internal length of the house at sixty-two cubits, in opposition to the statement in the text, that the length of the house (which was divided into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies) was sixty cubits; but in opposition to v. 16, according to which the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies were separated by boards of cedar, he assumes that there was a wall of two cubits in thickness between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, according to <a href="/ezekiel/41-3.htm">Ezekiel 41:3</a>; and, lastly, for no other reason than the wish to get the round number 100, he takes for granted that the hinder wall of the temple was a cubit thicker than that on the other sides.)<p>The number of rooms in the side buildings is not given, but may be set down at thirty in each story, if their length corresponded to their breadth in the lower story. These rooms had of course windows, although they are not mentioned in the account, but each one would have only a small window sufficient to give it the requisite light. And as to the number of the temple windows also, we can simply make conjectures. We can hardly assume that there were more than six on each side, and there were probably none at the back. </body></html>
