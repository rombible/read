They were apparently windows made by overlaid woodwork, either in the fashion of sloping louvre boards or fashioned like latticework crosswise. Then the last word indicates that they were closed in some way or other. Hence the margins of the A.V. ‘windows broad <span class="ital">within and</span> narrow <span class="ital">without</span>’ or ‘skewed <span class="ital">and</span> closed.’ The former of these margins the R.V. has preserved, but gives in the text <span class="bld">windows of fixed latticework</span>, taking the word ‘closed’ to imply the permanent nature of the woodwork in the apertures. These windows were in the wall, above the roof of the chambers which are described in the next verse, and must have been of the nature of the clerestory windows which overlook the aisles of a church. There could have been only very little light from them, but the building was lighted artificially.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</span> [There has been much disputation over these words.

The windows of the temple would then have resembled those of Egyptian sacred buildings. (It is not implied that there was any conscious imitation of Egypt, though Fergusson surely forgets the affinity with Pharaoh (<a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>), the trade with Egypt (<a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>), and the favour with which some Egyptian fashions were regarded (<a href="/songs/1-9.htm">Song of Solomon 1:9</a>), when he contends that the chosen people would never take the buildings of their ancestral enemy for a model.) But this meaning is not supported by the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), the literal interpretation of which is "<span class="accented">closed beams<span class="cmt_word">"</span></span> (cf. chap. 7:4, 5), and which the most competent scholars now understand to mean "<span class="accented">closed or fixed lattices, i.e.</span>, the lattices or the temple windows were not movable, as in domestic architecture  (<a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13.htm">2 Kings 13, 17</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>).

Ewald, 287, a.). Moreover, at the close of the account of the whole of Solomon's buildings (<a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>), 550 more &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; are mentioned as presiding over the people who did the work. The accounts in the Chronicles differ from these in a very peculiar manner, the number of overseers being given in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a> and 3600, and in <a href="/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a> as 250. Now, however natural it may be, with the multiplicity of errors occurring in numerical statements, to assume that these differences have arisen from copyists' errors through the confounding together of numerical letters resembling one another, this explanation is overthrown as an improbable one, by the fact that the sum-total of the overseers is the same in both accounts (3300 + 550  equals  3850 in the books of Kings, and 3600 + 250  equals  3850 in the Chronicles); and we must therefore follow J. H. Michaelis, an explain the differences as resulting from a different method of classification, namely, from the fact that in the Chronicles. the Canaanitish overseers are distinguished from the Israelitish (viz., 3600 Canaanites and 250 Israelites), whereas in the books of Kings the inferiores et superiores praefecti are distinguished. Consequently Solomon had 3300 inferior overseers and 550 superior (or superintendents), of whom 250 were selected from the Israelites and 300 from the Canaanites. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16-17</a>, it is expressly stated that the 3600 were taken from the &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., the Canaanites who were left in the land of Israel. And it is equally certain that the number given in <a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a> (550 and 250) simply comprises the superintendents over the whole body of builders, notwithstanding the fact that in both passages (<a href="/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a> and <a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>) the same epithet &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; is used. If, then, the number of overseers is given in <a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a> and 550, i.e., 300 more than in the parallel passage of the Chronicles, there can hardly be any doubt that the number 550 includes the 300, in which the number given in our chapter falls short of that in the Chronicles, and that in the 3300 of our chapter the superintendents of Canaanitish descent are not included.<p>(Note: Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 292) assumes that "by the 550 (<a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>) we are to understand the actual superintendents, whereas the 3300 (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>) include inferior inspectors as well; and of the 550 superintendents, 300 were taken from the Canaanaeans, so that only 250 (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a>) were native Hebrews;" though he pronounces the number 3600 (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>) erroneous. Bertheau, on the other hand, in his notes in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-10.htm">2 Chronicles 8:10</a>, has rather complicated than elucidated the relation in which the two accounts stand to one another.) </body></html>
