This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise.

It has been estimated as somewhat less than a foot, and again as between 19 and 20 inches, a difference of nearly 8 inches, which would produce a variation of nearly 40 feet in the length of the temple-chamber, and of 46 in that of the entire building. It is worthy of remark that, even according to the highest estimate, Solomon's temple was really a small building, less than 120 feet long, and less than 35 broad. Remark that the measures of the temple, both "house" and porch <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>, were exactly double those of the older tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a> note).

The height of this porch is said (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm" title="And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>) to have been 120 cubits. This height = 180 ft. is out of proportion to the other dimensions, and Mr Robins suggests that, after his manner, the Chronicler has added together the 4 dimensions in height of the 4 sides of the porch, and that the true height was 30 cubits. That the Chronicler does put down his numbers in this strange fashion is shewn from <a href="/2_chronicles/3-11.htm" title="And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.">2 Chronicles 3:11</a>, where he first writes ‘the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long.’ He afterwards explains that he means each of the 4 wings was 5 cubits long, but left alone the first statement would be misleading. In the same manner the pillars which in <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm" title="For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.">1 Kings 7:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm" title="Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:17</a> are said to be each 18 cubits high, are described in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.">2 Chronicles 3:15</a> as ‘two pillars of thirty and five cubits high’. Where it is suggested that the two heights given in Kings are added together.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the temple of the house</span>] This means the holy place. Cf. below <a href="/1_kings/6-17.htm" title="And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.">1 Kings 6:17</a>, where it is called ‘the temple before the oracle.’ The ‘oracle’ is the special name for the most holy place.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the porch</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, forepart, projection (<span class="accented">Vorhalle</span>, Gesenius).

Bahr holds that it had only side walls and cieling (sic), and was entirely open in front; and the fact that no mention is made of any door or opening, though the doors of the other parts of the edifies are all referred to (vers. 8, 31, 33), certainly favours this view, as also does the position of the pillars of <a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>] <span class="cmt_word">before the temple of the house</span> [The house, or main building (ver. 2), had two parts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">The temple of the house"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>   =   "spacious," hence "magnificent building," "palace," as in <a href="/proverbs/30-28.htm">Proverbs 30:28</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>.

It would certainly be out of all proportion. Towers are generally built about three times the height of the adjoining nave, but this would be six times as high, and moreover the porch did not taper to a point like a Gothic spire. It is much more probable, therefore, that there is a corruption of the text of Chronicles (see on 2 Chronicles 3:4) - errors in numbers are by no means infrequent - than that such a column could be erected to serve as a <span class="accented">porch</span>, or if erected - and this consideration appears to me to be decisive - could have been passed over by our author without notice. It is impossible, however, to say positively what the height of the porch was. Probably 30 cubits, the height of the house. Stanley characteristically puts it down as "more than 200 feet." It may be remarked here that Fergusson, following Josephus and the Talmud, contends that the temple had another building of the same height above it. See Dict.

This is favoured both by the context, since <a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a> speaks of stone-mason's work, and also by the usage of the language, inasmuch as &#1495;&#1510;&#1489; is mostly applied to the quarrying and cutting of stones (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-13.htm">2 Kings 12:13</a>), and only occurs in <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a> in connection with the cutting of wood. The hewing and preparing of the wood were amply provided for by 30,000 Israelites. That the 150,000 bearers of burdens and hewers of stone were not taken from the Israelites, is evident from the fact that they are distinguished from the latter, or at all events are not described as Israelites.
