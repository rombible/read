Unlike this latter, it is one of simple promise of blessing, with no note of warning. But it is to be observed that, in accordance with the general principle laid down in <a href="/context/jeremiah/18-5.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 18:5-10</a>, the promise—repeating the promises already made to David in <a href="/context/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2Samuel 7:10-15</a>, and to Moses in <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm" title="And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.">Exodus 25:8</a>, but with special application to the newly-built Temple—is made strictly conditional on obedience. In its main points, indeed, as working out the great covenant with Abraham for the blessing of all families of the earth, it was to be in any case fulfilled. But for each generation the enjoyment of the blessings promised was contingent on faith and obedience, and for the whole nation it was from time to time forfeited, until the final destruction of Israel as a nation. Yet even now, St. Paul (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm" title="For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.">Romans 11:29</a>) teaches that for Israel there is still some hope of the ancient promise of blessing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_kings/6-11.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,...">1 Kings 6:11-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">The word of the Lord came to Solomon — </span>By the prophet. <span class="ital">If thou wilt walk in my statutes, </span>&c. — Here God expresses the condition upon which his promise and favour is suspended; and, by assuring him thereof in case of obedience, he plainly intimates the contrary upon his disobedience.

It was very seasonable, being designed: first, to encourage him to go on with the building, by confirming anew the promise made to his father David (2Sa 7:12-16); and secondly, to warn him against the pride and presumption of supposing that after the erection of so magnificent a temple, he and his people would always be sure of the presence and favor of God. The condition on which that blessing could alone be expected was expressly stated.

"He built against the wall of the house an outwork round about (i.e., against the two longer sides and against the hinder wall, and not against the front also, where the porch was built), against the walls of the house round about, against the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, and he made side chambers round about." &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (written constantly &#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1506; in the Keri) signifies literally stratum, here the lower building or outwork erected against the rooms mentioned. The word is gen. comm., but so construed that the masculine is used in a collective sense to denote the whole of the outworks, consisting as they did of three stories, whereas the feminine is used for one single story of the building (<a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). On this use of the masculine and feminine genders to distinguish the whole mass and the individual parts, which is very common in Arabic, though it is rare in Hebrew, in which the distinction is generally expressed by a peculiar feminine form. as for example &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; a fleet, and &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; a single ship, compare Ewald, Lehrbuch der hebr.

Michaelis), but &#1488;&#1514; is a sign of the accusative, "as for the walls," and introduces the more precise definition. &#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; signifies, both here and in <a href="/ezekiel/41-6.htm">Ezekiel 41:6</a>., side chambers or side stories, from &#1510;&#1500;&#1506;, to incline to one side, hence to limp, i.e., to lean constantly to one side. From this there were derived for &#1510;&#1500;&#1506; the meanings side, side piece or side wall, e.g., of the ark, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>, etc., of the dwelling, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-20.htm">Exodus 26:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/26-26.htm">Exodus 26:26</a>, etc., of the altar, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/27-7.htm">Exodus 27:7</a>, etc., the side wall or slope of a mountain, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-13.htm">2 Samuel 16:13</a>, the side portion of the human body, i.e., the rib, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21-22</a>, the sides or leaves of a door in <a href="/1_kings/6-34.htm">1 Kings 6:34</a> of the present chapter, and when used of buildings, the side pieces or portions built out which lean against the main building; and lastly, the idea of a piece which shows a large side, i.e., a broad plank (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15-16</a>). The meaning planks or beams, as it were ribs or rib-work, is unfounded.</body></html>
