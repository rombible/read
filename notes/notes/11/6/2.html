It was, therefore—whatever measure we take for the cubit—a small building. Taking the usual calculation of eighteen inches for the cubit, the whole would be ninety feet long, thirty feet wide, and forty-five feet high—not larger than a good-sized parish church, and in proportion not unlike a church of Gothic construction. It is, indeed, curious to note that this likeness is carried out in the existence of the porch (which is even represented in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm" title="And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.">2Chronicles 3:4</a> as rising into a lofty entrance tower), the division of the house into two parts, like a nave and chancel, the provision of something like aisles (though opening outwards) and of clerestory windows, and the high pitch of the roof. This resemblance is probably not mere coincidence; for in the old Freemasonry, which had a great influence on mediaeval architecture, the plan of Solomon’s Temple was taken in all its details as a sacred guide. The “Oracle” or Most Holy place, was lower than the rest, forming an exact cube of thirty feet; the height of the Holy place (sixty feet long and thirty feet wide) is not given, but was probably the same, so that there would be an upper chamber over the whole under the roof—which, like that of the Tabernacle, appears to have been a high-pitched roof—fifteen feet high along the central beam, with sloping sides. This is apparently alluded to in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.">2Chronicles 3:9</a>, and possibly in <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>, and in the remark of Josephus, “There was another building erected over it, equal in its measures.” The Temple was, in fact, only a shrine for the ministering priests—the outer court, or courts, being the place for the great assembly of the congregation—and it relied for magnificence not on size, but on costliness of material and wealth of decoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm" title="And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.">1 Kings 6:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The house — </span>Properly so called, as distinct from all the walls and buildings adjoining to it; namely, the holy and most holy place. <span class="ital">Which King Solomon built for the Lord — </span>For his worship and service; and wherein his divine presence might, as it were, dwell among them by a visible appearance. <span class="ital">The length thereof was threescore cubits — </span>From east to west; forty of which belonged to the holy place, and twenty to the most holy.

The height of the holy place, therefore, was three times the height of that part of the tabernacle. For this temple was to resemble a high tower having chambers in three stories, one above another. “All the measures,” says Poole, “compared each with other, were harmonious. For sixty to twenty (the length to the breadth) is triple; or as three to one: and sixty to thirty (the length to the height) is double; or as two to one: and thirty to twenty (the height to the breadth) is one and a half, or as three to two. Which are the proportions answering to the three great concords in music, commonly called a twelfth, an eighth, and a fifth.

This gave it the beauty of holiness, that it was the house of the Lord, which was far beyond all other beauties. It was to be the temple of the God of peace, therefore no iron tool must be heard; quietness and silence suit and help religious exercises. God's work should be done with much care and little noise. Clamour and violence often hinder, but never further the work of God.

It has been estimated as somewhat less than a foot, and again as between 19 and 20 inches, a difference of nearly 8 inches, which would produce a variation of nearly 40 feet in the length of the temple-chamber, and of 46 in that of the entire building. It is worthy of remark that, even according to the highest estimate, Solomon's temple was really a small building, less than 120 feet long, and less than 35 broad. Remark that the measures of the temple, both "house" and porch <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>, were exactly double those of the older tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/26-18.htm">Exodus 26:18</a> note).

Mr Fergusson, speaking of the length of the cubit says, ‘we find that a cubit of 18 English inches meets all the difficulties of the case with as much accuracy as can be obtained.’ We see then that the Temple, exclusive of the rooms by which it was surrounded, was but a very small building, 90 feet long, 30 feet broad, and 45 feet high in its loftiest portion, and the Tabernacle only half that size. Neither building was meant to contain the worshippers. The priests went in, while the multitude remained outside (cf. <a href="/context/luke/1-9.htm" title="According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord....">Luke 1:9-10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An interesting paper on Solomon’s Temple, by Mr E.

Probably at first it signified, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, the length from point of elbow to tip of little or middle finger. But it is obvious that this was an uncertain measure, and hence perhaps arose cubits of different length. According to Gesen. the cubit here mentioned, which was the older or sacred Mosaic cubit (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>), was six palms, while that of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>), the royal Babylonian cubit, was seven, but on this as well as other points the authorities are very far from agreed. "The length of the cubit is one of the most knotty points of Hebrew archaeology" (Dict. Bib. 3, p. 1736). There is a general <span class="accented">consensus</span> of opinion, however in favour of understanding the cubit here mentioned as measuring 18 inches. Fergusson (Dict. Bib. 3:1451) considers this to be beyond question. It is certainly noteworthy that the measurements of Kings and Chronicles, of Ezra and Ezekiel, of Josephus and the Talmud, all agree, and we know that Josephus always uses the Greek cubit of 18 inches. Mr. Conder, however, maintains that the Hebrew cubit amounts to no more than <span class="accented">sixteen</span> inches. He says, "Maimonides tells us that the temple cubit was of 48 barleycorns, and any one who will take the trouble to measure barleycorns, will find that three go to the inch" - which gives 16 inches for the cubit. To this argument, which is not perhaps of much weight, he adds, what is of much greater moment, that "the Galilean synagogues, measured by it, give round numbers" (pp. 187-8)] <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</span> [It thus appears that the temple was but a small - compared with many churches, a <span class="accented">very</span> small - building. But its purpose and object must be considered. It was not for assemblies of the people. The congregation never met <span class="accented">within</span> it, but the worship was offered <span class="accented">towards</span> it. It was a place for the Holy Presence, and for the priests who ministered before it.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The tributary labourers out of Israel. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>.

He raised them out of the nation, to send the up Lebanon (cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>). These 30,000 Israelitish labourers must be distinguished from the remnants of the Canaanites who were made into tribute-slaves (<a href="/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a> and <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>). The latter are called &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1505;, tribute-slaves, in <a href="/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a> as in <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>. That the Israelites were not to render the service of bondsmen is evident from the fact, that they only rendered tribute for four months of the year, and were at home for eight months; and the use of the epithet &#1502;&#1505; is not at variance with this. For even if this word is applied elsewhere to the Canaanitish bondsmen (e.g., <a href="/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-28.htm">Judges 1:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/8-8.htm">2 Chronicles 8:8</a>), a distinction is decidedly made in our account of Solomon between &#1502;&#1505; and &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1505;, inasmuch as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>, after the Canaanitish bondsmen have been mentioned, it is expressly stated that "of Israel Solomon made no one a slave" (&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;). The 30,000 Israelitish tribute-servants are "to be thought of as free Israelites, who simply performed the less severe work of felling trees in fellowship with and under the direction of the subjects of Hiram _(see at <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>), according to the command of the king, and probably not even that without remuneration" (Thenius).
