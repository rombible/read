Every believer is a living temple, in whom the Spirit of God dwells, 1Co 3:16. This living temple is built upon Christ as its Foundation, and will be perfect in due time. 3. The gospel church is the mystical temple. It grows to a holy temple in the Lord, enriched and beautified with the gifts and graces of the Spirit. This temple is built firm, upon a Rock. 4. Heaven is the everlasting temple. There the church will be fixed. All that shall be stones in that building, must, in the present state of preparation, be fitted and made ready for it.

It is clear from ver. 22 that "all the house" blazed with gold in every part. If the <span class="accented">floors</span> were covered with gold, we may be sure both <span class="accented">walls</span> and <span class="accented">doors</span> would not be without their coating of the precious metal. Our author does not mention the curtain - it is clear that the doors would not dispense with the necessity for a vail - but the chronicler does (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>). It was necessary in order to cover the ark (<a href="/exodus/40-3.htm">Exodus 40:3, 21</a>); hence it was sometimes called "the vail of the covering." But for this, when the doors were opened on the day of atonement, the priest in the holy place might have gazed into the oracle. See on 1 Kings 8:8. The doors opened outwardly (into the house). The vail was suspended within the oracle.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The large cherub-figures in the Most Holy Place. - <a href="/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23</a>. He made (caused to be made) in the hinder room two cherubs of olive wood, i.e., wood of the oleaster or wild olive-tree, which is very firm and durable, and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-10.htm">2 Chronicles 3:10</a>, &#1510;&#1506;&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, i.e., according to the Vulgate, opus statuarium, a peculiar kind of sculpture, which cannot be more precisely defined, as the meaning of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; is uncertain. "Ten cubits was the height of it" (i.e., of the one and of the other). The figures had a human form, like the golden cherubs upon the ark of the covenant, and stood upright upon their feet (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-13.htm">2 Chronicles 3:13</a>), with extended wings of five cubits in length, so that one wing of the one reached to one wing of the other in the centre of the room, and the other wing of each reached to the opposite wall, and consequently the four extended wings filled the entire breadth of the Most Holy Place ( a breadth of twenty cubits), and the two cherubs stood opposite to one another and ten cubits apart. The wings were evidently fastened to the back and placed close to one another upon the shoulder-blades, so that the small space between their starting-points is not taken into consideration in the calculation of their length. The figures were completely overlaid with gold. The ark of the covenant was placed between these cherubs, and under the wings which pointed towards one another. As they were made like those upon the ark, they had evidently the same meaning, and simply served to strengthen the idea which was symbolized in the cherub, and which we have expounded in the Commentary on <a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>. Only their faces were not turned towards one another and bent down towards the ark, as in the case of the golden cherubim of the ark; but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-13.htm">2 Chronicles 3:13</a>, they were turned &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, towards the house, i.e., the Holy Place, so as to allow of the extension of the wings along the full length of the Most Holy Place.</body></html>
