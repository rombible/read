It is highly probable, though it is not expressly stated, that Chimham was the son of Bar-zillai (<a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37</a>). Rawlinson says, "Who the other sons were is not known." It would be more correct to say that we do not know whether there were any other sons.

It was esteemed an essential part of royal munificence throughout the East that the king should feed a large number of retainers and dependants. Cf. the account of Solomon's daffy provision in <a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>; also <a href="/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>; <a href="/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>]; <span class="cmt_word">for so</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in like manner, with <span class="accented">food</span>]; <span class="cmt_word">they came to me</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">came near."</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> often includes, as here, the idea of succour. Cf. <a href="/psalms/69-19.htm">Psalm 69:19</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-57.htm">Lamentations 3:57</a>. Barzillai certainly came (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>), and probably Chimham, but the Speaker's Commentary is mistaken when it says that "Chimham is mentioned as present." He was present at the return of David (<a href="/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31, 38</a>, but not necessarily before] <span class="cmt_word">when I fled because of</span> [lit., "from the face of "] <span class="cmt_word">Absalom</span> <span class="cmt_word">thy brother.</span> The mention of Absalom, and those terrible days of revolt and anarchy, when he was constrained to flee for his life, seems to have reminded the dying king of one of the bitterest ingredients of that bitter cup of shame and suffering - the cruel curses of Shimei. He remembers that the sin of Shimei, which was nothing else than treason and blasphemy, has so far escaped punishment. In a moment of generous enthusiasm, he had included Shimei in the general amnesty which he proclaimed on his return (<a href="/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>). He had thought, no doubt, at the time only of the offence against himself; he had forgotten his sacred and representative character as "the Lord's anointed;" or if he had remembered it (ver. 21) the emotions of that memorable day had obscured or perverted his sense of justice and duty. But he has since realized - and the thought weighs upon his conscience in the chamber of death - that he then pardoned what he had no power to pardon, viz., a sin to which the Mosaic law attached the penalty of death. For blasphemy, as for murder, there was no expiation short of the death of the blasphemer (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10, 13</a>); and blasphemy, like murder, though not perhaps to the same extent, involved those who heard it in its guilt, until they had discharged themselves of their sin upon the head of the guilty (<a href="/leviticus/14-14.htm">Leviticus 14:14</a>; cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). But Shimei, so far from having suffered the penalty of the law, had been twice protected against it; twice preserved alive, in defiance of law, by the supreme magistrate, the executor of law. And David, who has been charging his son to keep the law, now realizes that he himself has been a law breaker. He has kept his oath, sworn to his own or his people's hurt, and he will keep it to the end. But Solomon is under no such obligation. <span class="accented">He</span> can demand the long arrears of justice, none the less due because of the time that has elapsed and the royal <span class="accented">laches</span>  (<span class="accented">"nullum tempus occurrit regi"</span>); he can deal with the blasphemer as the law directs, and this David now charges him to do. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's Last Instructions and Death. - <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-1.htm">1 Kings 2:1-4</a>. When David saw that his life was drawing to a close, he first of all admonished his son Solomon to be valiant in the observance of the commandments of God. "I go the way of all the world" (as in <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>), i.e., the way of death; "be strong and be a man," - not "bear my departure bravely," as Thenius supposes, but prove thyself brave (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>) to keep the commandments of the Lord. Just as in <a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a> the object in which the bravery is to show itself is appended simply by the copula Vv; so is it here also with &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;.

This is afterwards more fully expanded in the expression &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, to keep the ordinances, commandments, rights, and testimonies of Jehovah. These four words were applied to the different precepts of the law, the first three of which are connected together in <a href="/genesis/26-5.htm">Genesis 26:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-28.htm">Deuteronomy 5:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11</a>, and served to individualize the rich and manifold substance of the demands of the Lord to His people as laid down in the Thorah. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, that thou mayest act wisely and execute well, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-8.htm">Deuteronomy 29:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>.</body></html>
