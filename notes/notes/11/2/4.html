God promised David that the Messiah should come from his descendants, and that promise was absolute; but the promise, that there should not fail of them a man on the throne of Israel, was conditional; if he walks before God in sincerity, with zeal and resolution: in order hereunto, he must take heed to his way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the Lord may continue his word - The original promise given to David indirectly, through Nathan <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-17</a>, and apparently unconditional, afterward was made conditional upon continued obedience.

David is here looking forward to the generations that shall come after him, which fact the A. V. has endeavoured to make clear by the rendering ‘continue’. The word, or promise, alluded to is found <a href="/context/2_samuel/7-25.htm" title="And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as you have said....">2 Samuel 7:25-29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">saying, If thy children take heed to their way</span>] In the passage just mentioned where the promise is recorded there are none of these conditions specified; but we are sure that God’s promise was not an unconditional one, and in his Psalms (<a href="/psalms/132-12.htm" title="If your children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit on your throne for ever more.">Psalm 132:12</a>) David has expressly made mention of the condition in words very similar to this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">there shall not fail thee</span> (<span class="ital">said he</span>) <span class="ital">a man on the throne of Israel</span>] The Heb. is literally ‘there shall not be cut off unto thee a man from upon the throne of Israel’; and the same phrase occurs afterwards ch. <a href="/1_kings/8-25.htm" title="Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that you promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that your children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as you have walked before me.">1 Kings 8:25</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm" title="Then I will establish the throne of your kingdom on Israel for ever, as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.">1 Kings 9:5</a>, and in other parts of the Bible. The sense is ‘there never shall be wanting some one of thy race to sit on the throne.’ The promise was made to David’s line, and was fulfilled; for as long as the kingdom of Judah existed the family of David were kings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no word in the Hebrew for the parenthetic ‘said he,’ but the clause is preceded by the word usually rendered ‘saying,’ which seems to have been introduced by some scribe from the earlier part of the verse.

In the promise of <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. there is no mention of any stipulations, <span class="accented">"If</span> thy children," etc. But both here and in Psalm 122:12, and in <a href="/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>, special prominence is given to the <span class="accented">condition</span> (<span class="accented">dum se bene gesserint</span>), which no doubt was understood, if not expressed, when the promise was first made], saying, <span class="cmt_word">If thy children take</span> <span class="cmt_word">heed to</span> [lit., "keep," same word as in vers. 2, 3] <span class="cmt_word">their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee</span> [lit., "be cut off to thee," as marg.

It had been his duty as king, as the power ordained of God, to visit all violations of the law of God with their appropriate penalties; and this duty, in some instances at least, had been neglected. For the law of Moses, reaffirming the primaeval law which formed part of the so called "precepts of Noah" (<a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>) - that ix. blood must be expiated by blood - enjoined, with singular emphasis and distinctness, the death of the murderer (<a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16, 17, 18, 19, 30-33</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>). It declared that so long as murder remained unpunished, the whole land was defiled and under a curse (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). And it gave the king no power to pardon, no discretion in the matter. Until the red stain of blood was washed out "by the blood of him that shed it" the Divine Justice was not satisfied, and a famine or pestilence or sword might smite the land. Now, David knew all this: he could not fail to know it, for he had seen his country, a few years before, visited by a famine because of the  unavenged blood of the Gibeonites (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>). And yet, one notorious and infamous murderer had not been put to death. The assassin of Abner and of Amasa still polluted the earth, still occupied a distinguished position, and defied punishment. But if the law of Moses was to be kept, then, whatever it might cost, and however painful it might be (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>), he must die; and David, for the welfare of his kingdom, the stability of his throne, and above all, the honour of God, must require his death. No doubt it had often burdened his mind, especially during these last days of feebleness, the thought that punishment had been so long delayed; and therefore, as he sees the end approaching, he feels that he must enjoin upon his successor the fulfilment of that duty which he had been too "weak" to discharge (<a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>). Hence he proceeds, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When this was reported to Solomon, together with the prayer of Adonijah that the king would swear to him that he would not put him to death with the sword (&#1488;&#1501; before &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, a particle used in an oath), he promised him conditional impunity: "If he shall be brave (&#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, vir probus), none of his hair shall fall to the earth," equivalent to not a hair of his head shall be injured (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a>); "but if evil be found in him," i.e., if he render himself guilty of a fresh crime, "he shall die." </body></html>
