David well knew how much it became the piety of his character to submit himself and his concerns to the divine disposal, throughout the whole course of his life; but could he, for this reason, wholly renounce the interest of justice? Or, if he could, he very well knew how dangerous an example it might be to his successors, to suffer such injuries and insults upon majesty to pass unpunished: and, therefore, when he had acted up to the <span class="ital">piety </span>and <span class="ital">dignity </span>of his own character, he very wisely admonished his son to act up to the <span class="ital">wisdom </span>of his.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 These dying counsels concerning Joab and Shimei, did not come from personal anger, but for the security of Solomon's throne, which was the murders he had committed, but would readily repeat them to carry any purpose; though long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last. Time does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder.

It must not be supposed that in these dying instructions David was evincing a fierce, vindictive spirit. He is rather to be considered as acting in the character of a king and magistrate, in noticing crimes which he had not been in a condition to punish, and pointing out persons of whom Solomon would be under a necessity to rid himself as dangerous to the state. The grateful mention of Barzillai's kindness [1Ki 2:7] was, however, a personal feeling that does honor to the warmth of his heart; and his silence as to Mephibosheth, the son of his beloved Jonathan, would imply the previous death of that prince.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With thee, </span> i.e. in thy power, as that phrase is oft used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cursed me with a grievous curse; </span> or, <span class="ital">reproached me with bitter reproaches</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/16-7.htm" title="And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:">2 Samuel 16:7</a>,8</span>; which David could not but deeply resent from him, though, as it was an affliction sent from God, he patiently submitted to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will not put thee to death with the sword.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> How then could David lawfully engage Solomon to punish him for it?

Keil gathers from this word that Shimei "was living at that time in Jerusalem," and refers to ver. 36, which, if anything, implies that he was not. But it is worth suggesting whether Shimei may not be the Shimei to whom reference is made in <a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>. (Dean Stanley notices this as a possibility, but alleges nothing in support of it: "Jewish Church," vol. 2 p. 171, note.) We there find Shimei and Rei mentioned as firm adherents of Solomon at the time of Adonijah's rising, and in these words, they "were not <span class="accented">with Adonijah."</span> Surely it is not an unfair presumption - if there is nothing to rebut it - that the Shimei subsequently mentioned as "with" Solomon is the same person. But it has been objected (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Kitto) that the false part that Shimei played at the time of Absalom's revolt would have forever prevented his being recognized and mentioned as one of Solomon's supporters. I very much doubt it. The great influence which Shimei possessed must be taken into account. Nothing shows that influence more clearly than the fact that on the day of David's restoration, despite the part he had taken, and the possible disgrace and danger that awaited him, he could still command the attendance of one thousand men of Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). Probably the secret of his influence lay in the fact that he was "of the family of the house of Saul," and possibly, owing to the insignificance of Saul's descendants, was the mainstay and chief representative of that house. And if so, there is nothing at all surprising in the mention of the fact that he was "not with Adonijah," and was subsequently "with" Solomon. It may have been a matter of great consequence at that critical time, which side Shimei - and the thousand or more Benjamites at his back - espoused. And if he <span class="accented">did</span> then declare for Solomon, it could hardly fail to procure him some amount of favour and consideration. He would thenceforward rank amongst the friends of the young king, and the words "thou hast with thee" would accurately describe his position] <span class="cmt_word">Shimei, the son of Gera</span> [another Shimei, the son of Elah, is mentioned (<a href="/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) as Solomon's officer <span class="accented">in Benjamin.</span> Gera must not be thought of as the "father" of Shimei, except in the sense of ancestor. He was removed from him by many generations, being the son of Bela and the grandson of Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>). Ehud, three hundred years earlier, is also described as "a son of Gera," <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>], <span class="cmt_word">a Benjamite</span> [lit., <span class="accented">the</span> Benjamite, meaning that Gera, not Shimei, was the Benjamite. He was well known as the son of Benjamin's firstborn (<a href="/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a>:l), and the head of a house in Benjamin. Professor Gardiner (American translation of Lange, textual note, p. 29), following the LXX. and Vulg., insists that, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (with the article) can only mean "son of the Jaminite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the descendants of Jamin, a son of Simeon." But this is directly contrary to what we read 9 <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, viz., that Shimei was of "a family of the house of Saul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a Benjamite. And to this the grammar agrees. <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a> is an exact parallel, and compare <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <a href="/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14, 18</a>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-58.htm">1 Samuel 17:58</a>] of Bahurim [the name means "<span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">young men</span>."

It may have lain in one of the waddies branching out from the ravine which runs continuously alongside the steep descent to Jericho. The event narrated in <a href="/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a> as happening at Bahurim may well have served to inflame Shimei's hatred.
