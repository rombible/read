The number of his days fixed and determined by the Lord, <a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>; and which might be perceived as drawing nigh, both by himself and others, through the growing infirmities of old age, decline of nature, and various symptoms of an approaching dissolution which were upon him; see <a href="/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29</a>.

There is nothing in those chapters beyond what an aged man might do, especially if he had a brief period of better health, and <a href="/1_chronicles/29-22.htm" title="And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.">1 Chronicles 29:22</a> makes special mention of Solomon’s second anointing which, like the first, preceded the death of his father.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I go the way</span> [lit., I am walking (same word as in ver. 3) in the way] <span class="cmt_word">of all the earth</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of all the sons of earth, all mankind (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-4.htm">Psalm 66:4</a>, etc.) The path to Sheol, the path which all his forefathers, and untold millions more, have trod, he is treading it now. The words sound like a <span class="accented">reminiscence</span> of <a href="/joshua/23.htm">Joshua 23, 24</a>. Perhaps, too, the thought of Joshua suggested to his mind the next words]: <span class="cmt_word">but</span> <span class="cmt_word">be thou strong, and be a man.</span> [Similar, though not identical, words were four times addressed to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6, 7, 9, 18</a>), and David may well have thought that his son, in entering upon his difficult duties, was not at all unlike Joshua when he succeeded Moses in the leadership of Israel, and that he needed similar encouragement. It is not necessary to  suppose, as Canon Rawlinson does ("Speaker's Com.," vol. 2 p. 489), that in the words, "show thyself a man," we have a reference to Solomon's <span class="accented">youth</span>; for words precisely similar were addressed to each other by the Philistines at Aphek (<a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). The age of Solomon at his accession is very doubtful. David said, "Solomon my son is young and tender" (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>); and Solomon says of himself, "I am a little child" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). Josephus, probably reflecting the tradition of his time, fixes his age at fourteen; Eupolemus at twelve. I incline to think that the words "young and tender" almost forbid the favourite opinion that he was about twenty.] <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jonathan replied: &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;, "yea but," corresponding to the Latin imo vero, an expression of assurance with a slight doubt, and then related that Solomon had been anointed king by David's command, and the city was in a joyous state of excitement in consequence (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; as in <a href="/ruth/1-19.htm">Ruth 1:19</a>), and that he had even ascended the throne, that the servants of the king had blessed David for it, and that David himself had worshipped and praised Jehovah the God of Israel that he had lived to see his son ascend the throne. The repetition of &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; three times (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-46.htm">1 Kings 1:46-48</a>) gives emphasis to the words, since every new point which is introduced with &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; raises the thing higher and higher towards absolute certainty. The fact related in <a href="/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a> refers to the words of Benaiah in <a href="/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a> and <a href="/1_kings/1-37.htm">1 Kings 1:37</a>. The Chethib &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; is the correct reading, and the Keri &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; an unnecessary emendation. The prayer to God, with thanksgiving for the favour granted to him, was offered by David after the return of his anointed son Solomon to the royal palace; so that it ought strictly to have been mentioned after <a href="/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>. The worship of grey-headed David upon the bed recalls to mind the worship of the patriarch Jacob after making known his last will (<a href="/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a>). </body></html>
