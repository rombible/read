No engagements or dangers will restrain worldly men; they go on, though they forfeit their lives and souls. Let us remember, God will not accommodate his judgment to us. His eye is over us; and let us strive to walk as in his presence. Let our every act, word, and thought, be governed by this great truth, that the hour is quickly coming when the smallest circumstances of our lives shall be brought to light, and our eternal state be fixed by a righteous and unerring God. Thus Solomon's throne was established in peace, as the type of the Redeemer's kingdom of peace and righteousness. And it is a comfort, in reference to the enmity of the church's enemies, that, how much soever they rage, it is a vain thing they imagine. Christ's throne is established, and they cannot shake it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Did I not make thee to swear - The Septuagint add to <a href="/1_kings/2-37.htm">1 Kings 2:37</a> a clause stating that Solomon "made Shimei swear" on the day when he commanded him to reside at Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. the king sent and called for Shimei&#8212;He was probably residing at Bahurim, his native place.
