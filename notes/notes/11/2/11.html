Time does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly of murder.

So David slept with his fathers&#8212;about six months after the coronation of Solomon (compare 2Sa 5:5 with 1Ch 29:27).

Jerusalem, however, formed an exception; and yet, even there, the privilege was reserved chiefly for the royal family (Ac 2:29). Tradition says that the bones of David repose on Mount Zion, and the minaret of a small mosque points out the spot which tradition has fixed. His was a noble, a wondrous, and a humbling history. He was a good man, yet his life was deformed by various crimes of a very gross character. But there were many bright and noble traits in his character; he was an earnest lover of the divine law; his reign was signalized by many important services that contributed to the glory of God and the exaltation of His kingdom; and his name, as the sweet Psalmist of Israel, will be held in honor to the latest age of the Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Seven years; </span> more precisely, seven years and six months, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm" title="In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.">2 Samuel 5:5</a></span>; but smaller sums are oft neglected in Scripture computations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years,....

The word which Jehovah has spoken concerning David (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;) is the promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>., the substance of which is quoted here by David with a negative turn, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488;, and with express allusion to the condition on which God would assuredly fulfil His promise, viz., if the descendants of David preserve their ways, to walk before the Lord in truth. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514; is more precisely defined by &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;...&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;. For the fact itself see <a href="/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>. The formula &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1500;&#1488; is formed after <a href="/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33</a> (compare also <a href="/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a> and <a href="/joshua/9-23.htm">Joshua 9:23</a>). "There shall not be cut off to thee a man from upon the throne of Israel," i.e., there shall never be wanting to thee a descendant to take the throne; in other words, the sovereignty shall always remain in thy family. This promise, which reads thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, "Thy house and thy kingdom shall be continual for ever before thee, and thy throne stand fast for ever," and which was confirmed to Solomon by the Lord Himself after his prayer at the consecration of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>), is not to be understood as implying that no king of the Davidic house would be thrust away from the throne, but simply affirms that the posterity of David was not to be cut off, so as to leave no offshoot which could take possession of the throne. Its ultimate fulfilment it received in Christ (see at <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>.). The second &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4</a> is not to be erased as suspicious, as being merely a repetition of the first in consequence of the long conditional clause, even though it is wanting in the Vulgate, the Arabic, and a Hebrew codex.<p>After a general admonition David communicated to his successor a few more special instructions; viz., first of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/7-6.htm">2 Samuel 7:6</a>), to punish Joab for his wickedness. "What Joab did to me:" - of this David mentions only the two principal crimes of Joab, by which he had already twice deserved death, namely, his killing the two generals. Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>) and Amasa the son of Jether (<a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>). The name &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; is written &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1488; in <a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>. Joab had murdered both of them out of jealousy in a treacherous and malicious manner; and thereby he had not only grievously displeased David and bidden defiance to his royal authority, but by the murder of Abner had exposed the king to the suspicion in the eyes of the people of having instigated the crime (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-28.htm">2 Samuel 3:28</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/3-37.htm">2 Samuel 3:37</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497; &#1502; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1501; "and he made war-blood in peace," i.e., he shed in the time of peace blood that ought only to flow in war (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; in the sense of making, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a>, etc.), "and brought war-blood upon his girdle which was about his loins, and upon his shoes under his feet," sc. in the time of peace. This was the crime therefore: that Joab had murdered the two generals in a time of peace, as one ought only to slay his opponent in time of war. Girdle and shoes, the principal features in oriental attire when a man is preparing himself for any business, were covered with blood, since Joab, while saluting them, had treacherously stabbed both of them with the sword. David ought to have punished these two crimes; but when Abner was murdered, he felt himself too weak to visit a man like Joab with the punishment he deserved, as he had only just been anointed king, and consequently he did nothing more than invoke divine retribution upon his head (<a href="/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a>). And when Amasa was slain, the rebellions of Absalom and Sheba had crippled the power of David too much, for him to visit the deed with the punishment that was due. But as king of the nation of God, it was not right for him to allow such crimes to pass unpunished: he therefore transferred the punishment, for which he had wanted the requisite power, to his son and successor.</body></html>
