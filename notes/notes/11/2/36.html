But it is difficult, in face of David’s charge, to doubt that it was in some degree intended as a snare; and this view is confirmed by Solomon’s words in <a href="/1_kings/2-44.htm" title="The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness on your own head;">1Kings 2:44</a>, which refer back to the old offence of Shimei against David. The narrative gives no hint that Shimei’s expedition to Gath was not made in good faith, simply to regain his slaves; and a command, which had its justification in the danger likely to result from his residence in Bahurim, among his own people, could hardly be disobeyed in spirit by a temporary journey to a foreign country. Legally the execution was justifiable, and it may have been politic; but it cannot stand examination on the ground of equity or generosity. It is here probably related by anticipation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_kings/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/2-36.htm" title="And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build you an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth there any where.">1 Kings 2:36</a></span>. <span class="ital">Go not forth thence any whither — </span>Solomon, it is likely, suspected Shimei’s loyalty and fidelity, and therefore ordered this, 1st, for his own security. For by confining him to the royal city, he would have him always under his eye, and in a place where, as in a public theatre, all his words and actions would be narrowly observed. And by removing him from that part of the country where his kindred, and estates, and interest lay, to a place where he was almost a stranger, and yet sufficiently odious for his former and never to be forgotten insolence toward his lord and king, he would be rendered utterly incapable of raising any tumults or seditions. Solomon enjoined this, 2d, as a kind of penalty for his former wickedness, wherein yet there was more mercy than justice, and from which David had not promised him any security, but had only given him his life for the present, or during his own life and reign.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:35-46 The old malignity remains in the unconverted heart, and a watchful eye should be kept on those who, like Shimei, have manifested their enmity, but have given no evidence of repentance. No engagements or dangers will restrain worldly men; they go on, though they forfeit their lives and souls. Let us remember, God will not accommodate his judgment to us. His eye is over us; and let us strive to walk as in his presence. Let our every act, word, and thought, be governed by this great truth, that the hour is quickly coming when the smallest circumstances of our lives shall be brought to light, and our eternal state be fixed by a righteous and unerring God. Thus Solomon's throne was established in peace, as the type of the Redeemer's kingdom of peace and righteousness. And it is a comfort, in reference to the enmity of the church's enemies, that, how much soever they rage, it is a vain thing they imagine. Christ's throne is established, and they cannot shake it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The object, apparently, was to keep Shimei under the immediate eye of the government.

But, as he was a suspicious character, Solomon condemned him henceforth to live in Jerusalem, on the penalty of death, for going without the gates.

This Solomon ordered, to prevent this man going about in the country sowing and stirring up sedition; and that he might be under his eye and notice, that should he commit any evil, and give him an opportunity of punishing him, he might do it as his father had directed him; and he might judge from the temper of the man, and indeed from the nature of men in general, that what they are forbidden they are the most prone unto, that he would transgress in this case, and give him an occasion against him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_kings/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_kings/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">36–46</span>.

The words &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;...&#1497;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; are introduced as a parenthesis to explain Joab's flight: "for Joab had leaned after Adonijah," i.e., taken his side (&#1488;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497; &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, as in <a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>; <a href="/judges/9-3.htm">Judges 9:3</a>), "but not after Absalom."<p>(Note: Instead of &#1488;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; the lxx (Cod. Vat.), Vulgate, Syr., and Arab. have adopted the reading &#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, and both Thenius and Ewald propose to alter the text accordingly. But whatever plausibility this reading may have, especially if we alter the preterite &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; into the participle &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; after the &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; of the lxx, as Thenius does, it has no other foundation than an arbitrary rendering of the lxx, who thought, but quite erroneously, that the allusion to Absalom was inapplicable here. For &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, to take a person's side, would suit very well in the case of Adonijah and Absalom, but not in that of Solomon, whose claim to the throne was not a party affair, but had been previously determined by God.)<p>There is no foundation in the biblical text for the conjecture, that Joab had given Adonijah the advice to ask for Abishag as his wife, just as Ahithophel had given similar advice to Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). For not only is there no intimation of anything of the kind, but Solomon punished Joab solely because of his crimes in the case of Abner and Amasa. Moreover, Abiathar was also deposed, without having any fresh machinations in favour of Adonijah laid to his charge. The punishment of Adonijah and Abiathar was quite sufficient to warn Joab of his approaching fate, and lead him to seek to save his life by fleeing to the altar. It is true that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13-14</a>, the altar could afford no protection to a man who had committed two murders. But he probably thought no more of these crimes, which had been committed a long time before, but simply of his participation in Adonijah's usurpation; and he might very well hope that religious awe would keep Solomon from putting him to death in a holy place for such a crime as that. And it is very evident that this hope was not altogether a visionary one, from the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>, when Joab refused to leave the altar at the summons addressed to him in the name of the king, Benaiah did not give him the death-blow at once, but informed Solomon of the fact and received his further commands. Solomon, however, did not arrest the course of justice, but ordered him to be put to death there and afterwards buried. The burial of the persons executed was a matter of course, as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, even a person who had been hanged was to be buried before sunset. When, therefore, Solomon gives special orders for the burial of Joab, the meaning is that Benaiah is to provide for the burial with distinct reference to the services which Joab had rendered to his father. "And take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and my father's house." So long as Joab remained unpunished for the double murder, the blood-guiltiness rested upon the king and his house, on whom the duty of punishment devolved (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30-31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>). &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;, blood without cause, i.e., blood shed in innocence. On the connection of the adverb with the substantive, at which Thenius takes offence, comp. Ges. 151, 1, and Ewald, 287, d. - For V. 32, compare <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>. The words of Solomon in v. 33a point back to the curse which David uttered upon Joab and his descendants after the murder of Abner (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-28.htm">2 Samuel 3:28-29</a>). "But to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, let there be salvation for ever from Jehovah." This wish sprang from a conviction, based upon <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, that the Lord would not fulfil His promise to David unless his successors upon the throne exercised right and justice according to the command of the Lord.</body></html>
