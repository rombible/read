Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. Solomon looks upward to God as the Author of peace, and forward to eternity as the perfection of it. The Lord of peace himself gives us that peace which is everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joab followed the example of Adonijab (margin reference).

Death, due to his great crimes (Nu 35:33), would long ago have been inflicted, had not his power and popularity with the army been too formidable for the old king. He now fled to the altar, which, though a recognized asylum, afforded no sanctuary to the rebel and murderer (Ex 21:14). And, as he refused to leave it, he seems to have cherished some faint hope that a religious scruple would have been felt at the thought of violating the sanctity of the place by bloodshed. Benaiah, not liking to assume any responsibility, referred the matter to Solomon, who determined that the law should take its course (De 19:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_kings/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, if he will not come thence, as I foresee he will not. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_kings/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was told King Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord,....
