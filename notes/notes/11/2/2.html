The authority of a dying father is much, but nothing to that of a living God. God promised David that the Messiah should come from his descendants, and that promise was absolute; but the promise, that there should not fail of them a man on the throne of Israel, was conditional; if he walks before God in sincerity, with zeal and resolution: in order hereunto, he must take heed to his way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David appears to have in his thoughts the divine address to Joshua. Without following it servilely, he reproduces several of its leading expressions and sentiments (compare the margin reference). Solomon's youth clearly constituted one of the chief difficulties of his position. If he was about nineteen or twenty, and known to be of a pacific disposition <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>, then to have to rule over the warlike and turbulent Hebrew nation, with a strong party opposed to him, and brothers of full age ready to lead it, was evidently a most difficult task. Hence, he is exhorted, though in years a boy, to show himself in Spirit "a man." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_kings/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

A path which is the path of death (o), which all pass in, kings and peasants, high and low, rich and poor, great and small, good and bad; none are exempted, all must die, and do; it is the appointment of God, a decree which can never be reversed; all experience confirms it: this same phrase is used by Joshua, from whom David seems to have borrowed it, and shows that that book was written in his days, <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>; <p>be thou strong therefore; not discouraged at my death, being a common thing, and to be expected; nor at being left alone, the Lord can give thee wisdom and counsel, assistance and strength, protection, and defence; take heart therefore, and be of good courage: <p>and show thyself a man; in wisdom and understanding, and in fortitude of mind, though so young a man; which were necessary for the government of so great a people, and to guard against the secret intrigues of some, and the open flatteries of others, and the fear of attempts against his person and government, and the temptations he might be liable to, to do wrong things; and especially they were necessary to enable him to keep the commands of God, as follows; which required great strength of mind and of grace, considering the corruptions of nature, the temptations of Satan, and the snares of men; see <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>. <p>(o) "------ omnes una manet nox, Et calcanda semel via lethi".

The same expression is used by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>), and, though the Hebrew noun is not the same, we may compare <a href="/job/16-22.htm" title="When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall not return.">Job 16:22</a> â€˜I shall go the way whence I shall not return.â€™<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be thou strong therefore</span>] Compare the oft-repeated injunction to Joshua, <a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm" title="And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-23.htm" title="And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>; <a href="/context/joshua/1-6.htm" title="Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them....">Joshua 1:6-7</a> &c. The circumstances are not very dissimilar. Moses, soon to be taken away, was giving his charge to his successor (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-23.htm" title="And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>), as David to Solomon, and the language is identical. Cf. also <a href="/1_chronicles/22-13.htm" title="Then shall you prosper, if you take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.">1 Chronicles 22:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shew thyself a man</span>] The age of Solomon at the death of his father cannot be exactly known. He must have been considerably younger than Adonijah, who was the fourth of those six sons born to David before the conquest of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/3-4.htm" title="And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;">2 Samuel 3:4</a>). And he may have been so young that his fatherâ€™s words mean, â€˜though a youth in years, yet prove yourself a man in prudence and wisdom.â€™ This is somewhat supported by Solomonâ€™s language about himself (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm" title="And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.">1 Kings 3:7</a>), â€˜I am but a little child.â€™ But it may also be understood as a general exhortation to exhibit the courage which would be necessary, since a party had been formed in the kingdom for the support of another claimant to the throne.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The news spread terror. All the guests of Adonijah fled, every man his way. Adonijah himself sought refuge from Solomon at the horns of the altar. The altar was regarded from time immemorial and among all nations as a place of refuge for criminals deserving of death; but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, in Israel it was only allowed to afford protection in cases of unintentional slaying, and for these special cities of refuge were afterwards provided (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>). In the horns of the altar, as symbols of power and strength, there was concentrated the true significance of the altar as a divine place, from which there emanated both life and health (see at <a href="/exodus/27-19.htm">Exodus 27:19</a>). By grasping the horns of the altar the culprit placed himself under the protection of the saving and helping grace of God, which wipes away sin, and thereby abolishes punishment (see Bhr, Symbolik des Mos. Cult. i. p. 474). The question to what altar Adonijah fled, whether to the altar at the ark of the covenant in Zion, or to the one at the tabernacle at Gibeon, or to the one built by David on the threshing-floor of Araunah, cannot be determined with certainty. It was probably to the first of these, however, as nothing is said about a flight to Gibeon, and with regard to the altar of Araunah it is not certain that it was provided with horns like the altars of the two sanctuaries. </body></html>
