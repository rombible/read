Those that show kindness to God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage. For this reason Solomon spares Abiathar's life, but dismisses him from his offices. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for, the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case.

Wilderness, or desert, gives however an insufficient idea of the kind of country that is meant. It was land under no regular cultivation, but yet to which cattle might be driven for pasturage. So in the narrative of the feeding of the Five Thousand where St Matthew (<a href="/1_kings/14-15.htm" title="For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.">1 Kings 14:15</a>) speaks of ‘a desert place,’ St John (<a href="/1_kings/6-10.htm" title="And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.">1 Kings 6:10</a>) says ‘now there was much grass in the place.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up</span> [not because the altar" stood higher up Mount Zion than Solomon's house" (Keil), but because Gibeon, where the tabernacle and brazen altar then were, stood higher than Jerusalem. It is remarkable that retribution thus overtook Joab on the very scene of his last murder, for it was "at the great stone which is in Gibeon" (<a href="/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>), that he slew Amasa. Cf. <a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>: "I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord"], <span class="cmt_word">and fell upon him, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">slew him: and he was buried in his own house</span> [possibly in the courtyard: hardly in the garden. The same is recorded of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>). It was evidently an exceptional occurrence. Remembering the estimation in which the Jew held the corpse and the grave (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11, 16, 22</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>), it must have been a singular honour to make of the house a mausoleum. No doubt it was designed to be such in Joab's case. Whatever his crimes, his services had deserved well of his country. Possibly his friends were led to pay him this special honour as a kind of counterpoise to the ignominy of his death] <span class="cmt_word">in the wilderness</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Judah. Joab's mother was of Bethlehem, which was on the border of the desert. The "wilderness of Tekoah" (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>), according to Jerome, was visible from Bethlehem, being but six Roman miles distant. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Execution of Joab. - When the report (of the execution of Adonijah and the deposition of Abiathar) came to Joab, he fled to the tent of Jehovah (not to the tabernacle, but to the holy tent upon Zion) to seek protection at the altar (see at <a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>). The words &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;...&#1497;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; are introduced as a parenthesis to explain Joab's flight: "for Joab had leaned after Adonijah," i.e., taken his side (&#1488;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497; &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, as in <a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>; <a href="/judges/9-3.htm">Judges 9:3</a>), "but not after Absalom."<p>(Note: Instead of &#1488;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; the lxx (Cod. Vat.), Vulgate, Syr., and Arab. have adopted the reading &#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, and both Thenius and Ewald propose to alter the text accordingly. But whatever plausibility this reading may have, especially if we alter the preterite &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; into the participle &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; after the &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; of the lxx, as Thenius does, it has no other foundation than an arbitrary rendering of the lxx, who thought, but quite erroneously, that the allusion to Absalom was inapplicable here. For &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1504;&#1496;&#1492;, to take a person's side, would suit very well in the case of Adonijah and Absalom, but not in that of Solomon, whose claim to the throne was not a party affair, but had been previously determined by God.)<p>There is no foundation in the biblical text for the conjecture, that Joab had given Adonijah the advice to ask for Abishag as his wife, just as Ahithophel had given similar advice to Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). For not only is there no intimation of anything of the kind, but Solomon punished Joab solely because of his crimes in the case of Abner and Amasa. Moreover, Abiathar was also deposed, without having any fresh machinations in favour of Adonijah laid to his charge. The punishment of Adonijah and Abiathar was quite sufficient to warn Joab of his approaching fate, and lead him to seek to save his life by fleeing to the altar. It is true that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13-14</a>, the altar could afford no protection to a man who had committed two murders. But he probably thought no more of these crimes, which had been committed a long time before, but simply of his participation in Adonijah's usurpation; and he might very well hope that religious awe would keep Solomon from putting him to death in a holy place for such a crime as that. And it is very evident that this hope was not altogether a visionary one, from the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>, when Joab refused to leave the altar at the summons addressed to him in the name of the king, Benaiah did not give him the death-blow at once, but informed Solomon of the fact and received his further commands. Solomon, however, did not arrest the course of justice, but ordered him to be put to death there and afterwards buried. The burial of the persons executed was a matter of course, as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, even a person who had been hanged was to be buried before sunset. When, therefore, Solomon gives special orders for the burial of Joab, the meaning is that Benaiah is to provide for the burial with distinct reference to the services which Joab had rendered to his father. "And take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and my father's house." So long as Joab remained unpunished for the double murder, the blood-guiltiness rested upon the king and his house, on whom the duty of punishment devolved (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30-31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>). &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;, blood without cause, i.e., blood shed in innocence. On the connection of the adverb with the substantive, at which Thenius takes offence, comp. Ges. 151, 1, and Ewald, 287, d. - For V. 32, compare <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>. The words of Solomon in v. 33a point back to the curse which David uttered upon Joab and his descendants after the murder of Abner (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-28.htm">2 Samuel 3:28-29</a>). "But to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, let there be salvation for ever from Jehovah." This wish sprang from a conviction, based upon <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, that the Lord would not fulfil His promise to David unless his successors upon the throne exercised right and justice according to the command of the Lord.</body></html>
