Hence, Moses, as the mediator of the covenant delegated by God to perform the act of consecration, also performed the sacrificial rites, whilst the installed priests stood as penitent sinners by the side of the sin offering which was now offered for the first time. For the laying on of the hands by the offerer on the victim, see <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm" title="And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.">Leviticus 1:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm" title="And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bullock for the sin offering.">Leviticus 8:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">The bullock — </span>There were, indeed, seven bullocks to be offered at his consecration, one every day; but here he mentions only one, because he here describes only the work of the first day.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-36 In these types we see our great High Priest, even Christ Jesus, solemnly appointed, anointed, and invested with his sacred office, by his own blood, and the influences of his Holy Spirit. He sanctifies the ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moses as the mediator of the covenant of the Law <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a> was called to perform the priestly functions, in consecrating those on whom henceforth those functions were to devolve, and in inaugurating the legal order of sacrifices. See <a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a> note. The sin-offering was now offered for the first time. The succession in which the sacrifices followed each other on this occasion, first the sin-offering, then the burnt-offering, and lastly the peace-offering, has its ground in the meaning of each sacrifice, and became the established custom in later ages. The worshipper passed through a spiritual process. He had transgressed the Law, and he needed the atonement signified by the sin-offering: if his offering had been made in truth and sincerity, he could then offer himself as an accepted person, as a sweet savour, in the burnt-offering; and in consequence, he could enjoy communion with the Lord and with his brethren in the peace-offering.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14-17</a><p>See the marginal references. The flesh of the sin-offering could not be eaten by any but a legally consecrated priest (<a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a> note). Moses therefore could not eat of it himself, though he was, for the occasion, performing the duties of a priest. Those whom he was consecrating could not eat it, not only because they were not yet duly installed, but because the sacrifice was offered on their behalf, and the body of the victim stood to them in the same relation as that of the regular sin-offering afterward stood to the high priest.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-17. brought the bullock for the sin offering, &c.&#8212;a timely expression of their sense of unworthiness&#8212;a public and solemn confession of their personal sins and a transference of their guilt to the typical victim.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There were indeed seven bullocks to be offered at his consecration, one every day, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/29-35.htm" title="And thus shall you do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded you: seven days shall you consecrate them.">Exodus 29:35</a>,36</span>; but here he mentions only one, either by a common enallage of number, or because he here describes only the work of the first day, and leaves the rest to be gathered from it; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/8-33.htm" title="And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.">Leviticus 8:33</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he brought the bullock for the sin offering,....
