A garment all blue with a hole for the head, and a binding of woven work round the whole to prevent its being rent. The Heb. word <span class="ital">mě‘îl</span> is applied to the robe (A.V. <span class="ital">coat</span>) made by Hannah for her son Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-19.htm" title="Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.">1 Samuel 2:19</a>), and to the robe (A.V. <span class="ital">mantle</span>) of Samuel which was rent by Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-27.htm" title="And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.">1 Samuel 15:27</a>). The clothing of the High Priest, though of costly material, is so far like that of other people, and similar to that worn by the Arabs of the present day; an under garment bound with a sash, and an outer robe reaching nearly to the ground, but this outer garment is now worn open in front. According to Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> iii. 7. 4, <span class="ital">B.J.</span> 8:5. 7) the robe of the ephod reached to the feet, but some writers describe it as shorter than the tunic. Its fringe of pomegranates and bells is described <a href="/context/exodus/28-33.htm" title="And beneath on the hem of it you shall make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:...">Exodus 28:33-35</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/39-24.htm" title="And they made on the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen....">Exodus 39:24-26</a> note the addition of ‘pure’ to ‘gold’ in the second passage), but being a part of the robe is not mentioned here or in Exodus 29.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the ephod</span>] This garment (described <a href="/exodus/28-6.htm" title="And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.">Exodus 28:6</a> ff; <a href="/context/exodus/39-2.htm" title="And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen....">Exodus 39:2-5</a>) was made of fine twined linen with blue purple and scarlet threads, and fine gold wire. Its exact shape cannot be determined. There were two shoulder straps, on each of which was an engraved onyx stone, and a band made of the same material as the ephod and woven with it in one piece, which served to gird the ephod over the other garments. This band is called ‘the cunningly woven band’ (<span class="ital">the curious girdle</span> A.V.) of the ephod; the Heb. <span class="ital">ḥçshĕb</span> denotes textile work of the highest grade, employed only for the curtains of the Dwelling, the veil, the ephod, and the pouch for the Urim and Thummim. See note on <a href="/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a>, where terms used for the different kinds of woven work are distinguished. The words ‘cunning,’ ‘cunningly’ were in Old English used to denote what is now termed ‘skilful,’ ‘skilfully.’ If the ephod consisted of front and back pieces, then the whole garment with its band would form a kind of waistcoat; if it consisted of a front piece only, it would resemble an apron. See Driver on <a href="/context/exodus/28-5.htm" title="And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen....">Exodus 28:5-12</a> and p. 312.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - The robing. The various articles of the priestly dress had been appointed and described before (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 29</a>). In these verses we see the order in which they were <span class="cmt_word">put on</span>. After the priests had, no doubt, changed their linen drawers, there came, first, <span class="cmt_word">the coat</span>, that is, a close-fitting tunic of white linen, made with sleeves and covering the whole body; <span class="cmt_word">next the girdle</span> of the tunic, that is, a linen sash for tying the tunic round the body, with variegated ends hanging on each side to the ankles; thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the robe</span>, that is, a blue vesture, woven of one piece, with holes for the head and arms to pass through, reaching from the neck to below the knee, the bottom being ornamented with blue, purple, and scarlet pomegranates, alternating with golden bells; fourthly, <span class="cmt_word">the ephod</span>, which consisted of two shoulder-pieces, or epaulettes, made of variegated linen and gold thread, fastened together in front and at the back by a narrow strap or band, from which hung, before and behind the wearer, two pieces of cloth confined below by <span class="cmt_word">the curious girdle of the ephod</span>, that is, by a sash made of the same material as the ephod itself. Into the ephod were sewn two onyxes, one on each shoulder, in gold filigree settings, one of them engraven with the names of half of the tribes, and the other with the remaining half; and from two rosettes or buttons by the side of these stones depended twisted gold chains for the support of the breastplate. Fifth came <span class="cmt_word">the breastplate</span>, which was a square pocket, made of embroidered linen, a span long and a span broad, worn upon the breast and hanging from the gold chains above mentioned, the lower ends of the gold chain being tied to two rings at the upper and outer corner of the breastplate, while the upper and inner corner of the same was attached to the ephod by blue thread running through two sets of rings in the breastplate and ephod respectively. The outer side of the breastplate was stiffened and adorned by twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three, each stone having on it the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The breastplate being double and the two sides and the bottom being sewn up, the pocket formed by it had its opening at the top. Into this pocket were placed <span class="cmt_word">the Urim and the Thummim</span>, which were probably two balls of different colours, one of which on being drawn out indicated the approval of God, and the other his disapproval, as to any point on which the high priest consulted him. (The Jewish tradition, that the Divine answer by the Urim and the Thummim came by a supernatural light thrown on certain letters in the names of the tribes, has no foundation.) The last part of the dress to be put on was <span class="cmt_word">the mitre</span>, or head-dress of linen, probably of the nature of a turban; to which, by a blue string, was attached <span class="cmt_word">the golden plate</span>, in such a way that it rested lengthwise on the forehead, and on this plate or <span class="cmt_word">holy crown</span> were inscribed the words," Holiness to the Lord." The investiture took place <span class="cmt_word">as the Lord commanded Moses</span>, that is, in accordance with the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. Its purpose and its meaning in the eyes of the people would have been twofold: first, after the manner of the king's crown and the judge's robe, it served to manifest the fact that the function of priest was committed to the wearer; and next, it symbolized the necessity of being clothed upon with the righteousness of God, in order to be able to act as interpreter and mediator between God and man, thus foreshadowing the Divine Nature of him who should be the Mediator in antitype. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of the Priests and the Sanctuary (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-37</a>). - The consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests was carried out by Moses according to the instructions in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12-15</a>; and the anointing of the tabernacle, with the altar and its furniture, as prescribed in <a href="/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26-29</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9-11</a>, was connected with it (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>, <a href="/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-1.htm">Leviticus 8:1-4</a><p><a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-1.htm">Leviticus 8:1-5</a> contain an account of the preparations for this holy act, the performance of which was enjoined upon Moses by Jehovah after the publication of the laws of sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/8-1.htm">Leviticus 8:1</a>).

The "basket of the unleavened" contained, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2-3</a>, (1) unleavened bread, which is called &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>, i.e., round flat bread-cakes, and &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; (loaf of bread) in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a>, and was baked for the purpose of the consecration (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>, <a href="/leviticus/8-32.htm">Leviticus 8:32</a>); (2) unleavened oil-cakes; and (3) unleavened flat cakes covered with oil (see at <a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a> and <a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>).</body></html>
