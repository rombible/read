He sanctifies the ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Purified the altar ... sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it - The altar had been sanctified by the anointing oil <a href="/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a> like the priests who were to officiate at it; it was now, like them, sanctified by blood, in acknowledgment of the alienation of all nature, in itself, from God, and the need of a reconciliation to Him of all things by blood. <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21-22</a>.

As in English ‘to stone plums’ means to remove the stones, so in Heb. a verb corresponding to a noun is sometimes used in the same way.
