According to Winer, Gesenius, and others, it signifies adspectui patens; whilst Meier and Knobel regard it as meaning literally the division, or middle-piece; and Dietrich attributes to it the fundamental signification, "to be moved," viz., the breast, as being the part moved by the heart.)<p>the brisket, which consists for the most part of cartilaginous fat in the case of oxen, sheep, and goats, and is one of the most savoury parts; so that at the family festivities of the ancients, according to Athen. Deipnos. ii. 70, ix. 10, &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; were dainty bits. The breast-piece was presented to the Lord as a wave-offering (tenuphah), and transferred by Him to Aaron and his sons (the priests). &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;, to swing, to move to and fro (see <a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>), is the name applied to a ceremony peculiar to the peace-offerings and the consecration-offerings: the priest laid the object to be waved upon the hands of the offerer, and then placed his own hands underneath, and moved the hands of the offerer backwards and forwards in a horizontal direction, to indicate by the movement forwards, i.e., in the direction towards the altar, the presentation of the sacrifice, or the symbolical transference of it to God, and by the movement backwards, the reception of it back again, as a present which God handed over to His servants the priests.<p>(Note: In the Talmud (cf. Gemar. Kiddush 36, 2, Gem. Succa 37, 2, and Tosaphta Menach. 7, 17), which Maimonides and Rashi follow, tenuphah is correctly interpreted ducebat et reducebat; but some of the later Rabbins (vid., Outram ut sup.) make it out to have been a movement in the direction of the four quarters of the heavens, and Witsius and others find an allusion in this to the omnipresence of God-an allusion which is quite out of character with the occasion.)<p>In the peace-offerings the waving was performed with the breast-piece, which was called the "wave-breast" in consequence (<a href="/leviticus/7-34.htm">Leviticus 7:34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm">Leviticus 10:14-15</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-20.htm">Numbers 6:20</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-18.htm">Numbers 18:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-27.htm">Exodus 29:27</a>). At the consecration of the priests it was performed with the fat portions, the right leg, and with some cakes, as well as with the breast of the fill-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-25.htm">Leviticus 8:25-29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-22.htm">Exodus 29:22-26</a>). The ceremony of waving was also carried out with the sheaf of first-fruits at the feast of Passover; with the loaves of the first-fruits, and thank-offering lambs, at the feast of Pentecost (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>, <a href="/leviticus/23-20.htm">Leviticus 23:20</a>); with the shoulder and meat-offering of the Nazarite (<a href="/numbers/6-20.htm">Numbers 6:20</a>); with the trespass-offering of the leper (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-12.htm">Leviticus 14:12</a>, <a href="/leviticus/14-24.htm">Leviticus 14:24</a>); with the jealousy-offering (<a href="/numbers/5-25.htm">Numbers 5:25</a>); and lastly with the Levites, at their consecration (<a href="/numbers/8-11.htm">Numbers 8:11</a>.). In the case of all these sacrifices, the object waved, after it had been offered symbolically to the Lord by means of the waving, became the property of the priests. But of the lambs, which were waved at the feast of Pentecost before they were slaughtered, and of the lamb which was brought as a trespass-offering by the leper, the blood and fat were given up to the altar-fire; of the jealousy-offering, only an azcarah; and of the fill-offering, for special reasons, the fat portions and leg, as well as the cakes. Even the Levites were given by Jehovah to the priests to be their own (<a href="/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>). The waving, therefore, had nothing in common with the porricere of the Romans, as the portions of the sacrifices which were called porriciae were precisely those which were not only given up to the gods, but burned upon the altars. In addition to the wave-breast, which the Lord gave up to His servants as their share of the peace-offerings, the officiating priest was also to receive for his portion the right leg as a terumah, or heave-offering, or lifting off. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1511; is the thigh in the case of a man (<a href="/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>; Sol 5:15), and therefore in the case of an animal it is not the fore-leg, or shoulder (&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, armus), which is called &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, or the arm (<a href="/numbers/6-19.htm">Numbers 6:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>), but the hind-leg, or rather the upper part of it or ham, which is mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/9-24.htm">1 Samuel 9:24</a> as a peculiarly choice portion (Knobel). As a portion lifted off from the sacrificial gifts, it is often called "the heave-leg" (v. 34; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm">Leviticus 10:14-15</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-20.htm">Numbers 6:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-27.htm">Exodus 29:27</a>), because it was lifted or heaved off from the sacrificial animal, as a gift of honour for the officiating priest, but without being waved like the breast-piece-though the more general phrase, "to wave a wave-offering before Jehovah" (<a href="/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>), includes the offering of the heave-leg (see my Archaeologie i. pp. 244-5). </body></html>
