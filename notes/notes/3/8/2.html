Aaron and his sons were washed with water, to signify that they ought to purify themselves from all sinful dispositions, and ever after to keep themselves pure. Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22. The anointing of Aaron was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which was not given by measure to him.

"This (the wave-breast and heave-leg) is the share of Aaron and his sons from the firings of Jehovah in the day (i.e., which Jehovah assigned to them in the day) when He caused them to draw near to become priests to Jehovah," i.e., according to the explanation in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-36.htm">Leviticus 7:36</a>, "in the day of their anointing." The word &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-35.htm">Leviticus 7:35</a>, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>, signifies not "anointing," but share, portio, literally a measuring off, as in Aramaean and Arabic, from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; to stroke the hand over anything, to measure, or measure off.<p>The fulness with which every point in the sacrificial meal is laid down, helps to confirm the significance of the peace-offerings, as already implied in the name &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; sacrificial slaughtering, slain-offering, viz., as indicating that they were intended for, and culminated in a liturgical meal. By placing his hand upon the head of the animal, which had been brought to the altar of Jehovah for the purpose, the offerer signified that with this gift, which served to nourish and strengthen his own life, he gave up the substance of his life to the Lord, that he might thereby be strengthened both body and soul for a holy walk and conversation. To this end he slaughtered the victim and had the blood sprinkled by the priest against the altar, and the fat portions burned upon it, that in these altar-gifts his soul and his inner man might be grounded afresh in the gracious fellowship of the Lord. He then handed over the breast-piece by the process of waving, also the right leg, and a sacrificial cake of each kind, as a heave-offering from the whole to the Lord, who transferred these portions to the priests as His servants, that they might take part as His representatives in the sacrificial meal. In consequence of this participation of the priests, the feast, which the offerer of the sacrifice prepared for himself and his family from the rest of the flesh, became a holy covenant meal, a meal of love and joy, which represented domestic fellowship with the Lord, and thus shadowed forth, on the one hand, rejoicing before the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>), and on the other, the blessedness of eating and drinking in the kingdom of God (<a href="/luke/13-15.htm">Luke 13:15</a>; <a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>). Through the fact that one portion was given up to the Lord, the earthly food was sanctified as a symbol of the true spiritual food, with which the Lord satisfies and refreshes the citizens of His kingdom. This religious aspect of the sacrificial meal will explain the instructions given, viz., that not only the flesh itself, but those who took part in the meal, were all to be clean, and that whatever remained of the flesh was to be burned, on the second or third day respectively, that it might not pass into a state of decomposition. The burning took place a day earlier in the case of the praise-offering than in that of the vow and freewill-offerings, of which the offerer was allowed a longer enjoyment, because they were the products of his own spontaneity, which covered any defect that might attach to the gift itself. </body></html>
