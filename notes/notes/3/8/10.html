Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes kings and priests to our God, Re 1:5,6; and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water, Heb 10:22.

Moses brought the persons to be consecrated, the official costume that had been made for them (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>), the anointing oil (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>.), and the requisite sacrificial offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-3</a>), to the door of the tabernacle (i.e., into the court, near the altar of burnt-offering), and then gathered "the whole congregation" - that is to say, the nation in the persons of its elders-there also (see my Archeologie ii. p. 221). The definite article before the objects enumerated in <a href="/leviticus/8-2.htm">Leviticus 8:2</a> may be explained on the ground that they had all been previously and more minutely described. The "basket of the unleavened" contained, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2-3</a>, (1) unleavened bread, which is called &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>, i.e., round flat bread-cakes, and &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; (loaf of bread) in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a>, and was baked for the purpose of the consecration (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>, <a href="/leviticus/8-32.htm">Leviticus 8:32</a>); (2) unleavened oil-cakes; and (3) unleavened flat cakes covered with oil (see at <a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a> and <a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>).</body></html>
