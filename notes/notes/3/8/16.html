He sanctifies the ordinances of religion, to the benefit of his people and the honour of God the Father; who for his sake accepts our worship, though it is polluted with sin. We may also rejoice, that he is a merciful and faithful High Priest, full of compassion to the feeble-minded and tempest-tossed soul. All true Christians are consecrated to be spiritual priests. We should seriously ask ourselves, whether in our daily walk we study to maintain this character? and abound in spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Christ? If so, still there is no cause for boasting. Let us not despise our fellow-sinners; but remembering what we have done, and how we are saved, let us seek and pray for their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Purified the altar ... sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it - The altar had been sanctified by the anointing oil <a href="/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a> like the priests who were to officiate at it; it was now, like them, sanctified by blood, in acknowledgment of the alienation of all nature, in itself, from God, and the need of a reconciliation to Him of all things by blood. <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21-22</a>.

Lev Exo 40:9-11), the anointing was performed first of all upon "the tabernacle and everything in it," i.e., the ark of the covenant, the altar of incense, the candlestick, and table of shew-bread, and their furniture; and then upon the altar of burnt-offering and its furniture, and upon the laver and its pedestal; and after this, upon Aaron himself, by the pouring of the holy oil upon his head. This was followed by the robing and anointing of Aaron's sons, the former only of which is recorded in <a href="/leviticus/8-13.htm">Leviticus 8:13</a> (according to <a href="/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40</a>), the anointing not being expressly mentioned, although it had not only been commanded, in <a href="/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>, but the performance of it is taken for granted in <a href="/leviticus/7-36.htm">Leviticus 7:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>, and <a href="/numbers/3-3.htm">Numbers 3:3</a>. According to the Jewish tradition, the anointing of Aaron (the high priest) was different from that of the sons of Aaron (the ordinary priests), the oil being poured upon the head of the former, whilst it was merely smeared with the finger upon the forehead in the case of the latter (cf. Relandi Antiqq. ss. ii. 1, 5, and 7, and Selden, de succ. in pontif. ii. 2). There appears to be some foundation for this, as a distinction is assumed between the anointing of the high priest and that of the ordinary priests, not only in the expression, "he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head" (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>, cf. <a href="/exodus/29-7.htm">Exodus 29:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), which is applied to Aaron only, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, <a href="/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>; although the further statement of the later Talmudists and Rabbins, that Aaron was also marked upon the forehead with the sign of a Hebrew &#1499; (the initial letter of &#1499;&#1492;&#1503;), has no support in the law (vid., Selden, ii. 9; Vitringa, observv. ss. ii. c. 15, 9). - On the mode in which the tabernacle and its furniture were anointed, all that is stated is, that the altar of burnt-offering was anointed by being sprinkled seven times with the anointing oil; from which we may safely conclude, that the other portions and vessels of the sanctuary were anointed in the same way, but that the sprinkling was not performed more than once in their case. The reason why the altar was sprinkled seven times with the holy anointing oil, is to be sought for in its signification as the place of worship. The anointing, both of the sacred things and also of the priests, is called &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; "to sanctify," in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10-12</a>, as well as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9-11</a> and <a href="/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>; and in <a href="/exodus/40-10.htm">Exodus 40:10</a> the following stipulation is added with regard to the altar of burnt-offering: "and it shall be most holy," - a stipulation which is not extended to the dwelling and its furniture, although those portions of the sanctuary were most holy also, that the altar of burnt-offering, which was the holiest object in the court by virtue of its appointment as the place of expiation, might be specially guarded from being touched by unholy hands (see at <a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). To impress upon it this highest grade of holiness, it was sprinkled even times with anointing oil; and in the number seven, the covenant number, the seal of the holiness of the covenant of reconciliation, to which it was to be subservient, was impressed upon it. To sanctify is not merely to separate to holy purposes, but to endow or fill with the powers of the sanctifying Spirit of God. Oil was a fitting symbol of the Spirit, or spiritual principle of life, by virtue of its power to sustain and fortify the vital energy; and the anointing oil, which was prepared according to divine instructions, was therefore a symbol of the Spirit of God, as the principle of spiritual life which proceeds from God and fills the natural being of the creature with the powers of divine life. The anointing with oil, therefore, was a symbol of endowment with the Spirit of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13-14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>) for the duties of the office to which a person was consecrated. The holy vessels also were not only consecrated, through the anointing, for the holy purposes to which they were to be devoted (Knobel), but were also furnished in a symbolical sense with powers of the divine Spirit, which were to pass from them to the people who came to the sanctuary. The anointing was not only to sanctify the priests as organs and mediators of the Spirit of God, but the vessels of the sanctuary also, as channels and vessels of the blessings of grace and salvation, which God as the Holy One would bestow upon His people, through the service of His priests, and in the holy vessels appointed by Him. On these grounds the consecration of the holy things was associated with the consecration of the priests. The notion that even vessels, and in fact inanimate things in general, can be endowed with divine and spiritual powers, was very widely spread in antiquity. We meet with it in the anointing of memorial stones (<a href="/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>), and it occurs again in the instructions concerning the expiation of the sanctuary on the annual day of atonement (ch. 16). It contains more truth than some modern views of the universe, which refuse to admit that any influence is exerted by the divine Spirit except upon animated beings, and thus leave a hopeless abyss between spirit and matter. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>, the clothing and anointing of Aaron and his sons were to be "a priesthood to them for a perpetual statute," i.e., to secure the priesthood to them for all ages; for the same thought is expressed thus in <a href="/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a> : "their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations." When the Talmudists refer these words to the sons of Aaron or the ordinary priests, to the exclusion of Aaron or the high priest, this is opposed to the distinct context, according to which the sons of Aaron were to be anointed like their father Aaron. The utter want of foundation for the rabbinical assumption, that the anointing of the sons of Aaron, performed by Moses, availed not only for themselves, but for their successors also, and therefore for the priests of every age, is also the more indisputable, because the Talmudists themselves infer from <a href="/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15</a> (cf. <a href="/exodus/29-29.htm">Exodus 29:29</a>), where the installation of Aaron's successor in his office is expressly designated an anointing, the necessity for every successor of Aaron in the high-priesthood to be anointed. The meaning of the words in question is no doubt the following: the anointing of Aaron and his sons was to stand as a perpetual statute for the priesthood, and to guarantee it to the sons of Aaron for all time; it being assumed as self-evident, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15</a>, that as every fresh generation entered upon office, the anointing would be repeated or renewed. </body></html>
