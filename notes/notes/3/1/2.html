Divers kinds of sacrifices are here prescribed, some by way of acknowledgment to God for mercies either desired or received; others by way of satisfaction to God for men’s sins; others were mere exercises of devotion. And the reason why so many kinds of them were appointed was, partly a respect to the childish state of the Jews, who, by the custom of nations, and their own natural inclinations, were much addicted to outward rites and ceremonies, that they might have full employment of that kind in God’s service, and thereby be kept from temptations to idolatry; and partly to represent, as well the several perfections of Christ, the true sacrifice, and the various benefits of his death, as the several duties which men owe to their Creator and Redeemer, all which could not be so well expressed by one sort of sacrifices. <span class="ital">Of the herd and of the flock — </span>By the <span class="ital">herd, </span>is meant oxen or kine; and by the <span class="ital">flock, </span>sheep or goats, as <a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a>.

But till the Israelites were in the wilderness, no very particular regulations seem to have been appointed. The general design of these laws is plain. The sacrifices typified Christ; they also shadowed out the believer's duty, character, privilege, and communion with God. There is scarcely any thing spoken of the Lord Jesus in Scripture which has not also a reference to his people. This book begins with the laws concerning sacrifices; the most ancient were the burnt-offerings, about which God here gives Moses directions. It is taken for granted that the people would be willing to bring offerings to the Lord. The very light of nature directs man, some way or other, to do honour to his Maker, as his Lord. Immediately after the fall, sacrifices were ordained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Speak unto the children of Israel - It is important to observe that these first instructions <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2-3:17</a> are addressed expressly to the individual who felt the need of sacrifice on his own account. They were not delivered through the priests, nor had the officiating priest any choice as to what he was to do. He was only to examine the victim to see that it was perfect <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-17.htm">Leviticus 22:17-24</a>, and to perform other strictly prescribed duties <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-8.htm">Leviticus 6:8-7:21</a>. The act of offering was to be voluntary on the part of the worshipper, but the mode of doing it was in every point defined by the Law. The presenting of the victim at the entrance of the tabernacle was in fact a symbol of the free will submitting itself to the Law of the Lord. Such acts of sacrifice are to be distinguished from the public offerings, and those ordained for individuals on special occasions (see <a href="/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a> note), which belonged to the religious education of the nation.<p>Offering - Hebrew: &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;  qorba&#770;n - the general name for what was formally given up to the service of God (compare <a href="/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>), and exactly corresponding to the words "offering" and "oblation." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The Targum of Jonathan is,"of a clean beast, of oxen, and of sheep, but not of wild beasts shall ye bring your offerings.''These were appointed, Ben Gersom says, for these two reasons, partly because the most excellent, and partly because most easy to be found and come at, as wild creatures are not: but the true reason is, because they were very fit to represent the great sacrifice Christ, which all sacrifices were typical of; the ox or bullock was a proper emblem of him for his strength and laboriousness, and the sheep for his harmlessness, innocence, and patience, and the goat, as he was not in himself, but as he was thought to be, a sinner, being sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and being traduced as such, and having the sins of his people imputed to him. <p>(d) Vid.

The cloud, in which Jehovah had hitherto been present with His people, and guided and protected them upon their journeying (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), now came down upon the tabernacle and filled the dwelling with the gracious presence of the Lord. So long as this cloud rested upon the tabernacle the children of Israel remained encamped; but when it ascended, they broke up the encampment to proceed onwards. This sign was Jehovah's command for encamping or going forward "throughout all their journeys" (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a>). This statement is repeated still more elaborately in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a>. The mode in which the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling, or in which Jehovah manifested His presence within it, is not described; but the glory of Jehovah filling the dwelling is clearly distinguished from the cloud coming down upon the tabernacle. It is obvious, however, from <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>, that in the dwelling the glory of God was also manifested in a cloud. At the dedication of the temple (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>) the expression "the cloud filled the house of Jehovah" is used interchangeably with "the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah." To consecrate the sanctuary, which had been finished and erected as His dwelling, and to give to the people a visible proof that He had chosen it for His dwelling, Jehovah filled the dwelling in both its parts with the cloud which shadowed forth His presence, so that Moses was unable to enter it. This cloud afterwards drew back into the most holy place, to dwell there, above the outspread wings of the cherubim of the ark of the covenant; so that Moses and (at a later period) the priests were able to enter the holy place and perform the required service there, without seeing the sign of the gracious presence of God, which was hidden by the curtain of the most holy place. So long as the Israelites were on their journey to Canaan, the presence of Jehovah was manifested outwardly and visibly by the cloud, which settled upon the ark, and rose up from it when they were to travel onward.<p>With the completion of this building and its divine consecration, Israel had now received a real pledge of the permanence of the covenant of grace, which Jehovah had concluded with it; a sanctuary which perfectly corresponded to the existing circumstances of its religious development, and kept constantly before it the end of its calling from God. For although God dwelt in the tabernacle in the midst of His people, and the Israelites might appear before Him, to pray for and receive the covenant blessings that were promised them, they were still forbidden to go directly to God's throne of grace. The barrier, which sin had erected between the holy God and the unholy nation, was not yet taken away. To this end the law was given, which could only increase their consciousness of sin and unworthiness before God. But as this barrier had already been broken through by the promise of the Lord, that He would meet the people in His glory before the door of the tabernacle at the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42-43</a>); so the entrance of the chosen people into the dwelling of God was effected mediatorially by the service of the sanctified priests in the holy place, which also prefigured their eventual reception into the house of the Lord. And even the curtain, which still hid the glory of God from the chosen priests and sanctified mediators of the nation, was to be lifted at least once a year by the anointed priest, who had been called by God to be the representative of the whole congregation. On the day of atonement the high priest was to sprinkle the blood of atonement in front of the throne of grace, to make expiation for the children of Israel because of all their sin (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>), and to prefigure the perfect atonement through the blood of the eternal Mediator, through which the way to the throne of grace is opened to all believers, that they may go into the house of God and abide there for ever, and for ever see God. </body></html>
