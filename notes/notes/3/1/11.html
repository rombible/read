Those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were mild, and gentle, and harmless; to show the innocence and meekness that were in Christ, and that should be in Christians. The offering of the poor was as typical of Christ's atonement as the more costly sacrifices, and expressed as fully repentance, faith, and devotedness to God. We have no excuse, if we refuse the pleasant and reasonable service now required. But we can no more offer the sacrifice of a broken heart, or of praise and thanksgiving, than an Israelite could offer a bullock or a goat, except as God hath first given to us. The more we do in the Lord's service, the greater are our obligations to him, for the will, for the ability, and opportunity. In many things God leaves us to fix what shall be spent in his service, whether of our time or our substance; yet where God's providence has put much into a man's power, scanty offerings will not be accepted, for they are not proper expressions of a willing mind. Let us be devoted in body and soul to his service, whatever he may call us to give, venture, do, or suffer for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Northward before the Lord - That is, on the north side of the altar.

This is a circumstance not mentioned in the killing of the bullock: Maimonides (g) says, there was a square place from the wall of the altar northward, to the wall of the court, and it was sixty cubits, and all that was over against the breadth of this, from the wall of the porch to the eastern wall, and it is seventy six cubits; and this foursquare place is called the "north", for the slaying of the most holy things; so that it seems this being a large place, was fittest for this purpose. Aben Ezra intimates, as if some respect was had to the situation of Mount Zion; his note is, "on the side of the altar northward", i.e. without, and so "the sides of the north", <a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a> for so many mistake who say that the tower of Zion was in the midst of Jerusalem; and with this agrees Mr. Ainsworth's note on <a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a> hereby was figured, that Christ our sin offering should be killed by the priests in Jerusalem, and Mount Sion, which was on "the sides of the north", <a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a> crucified on Mount Calvary, which was on the northwest side of Jerusalem; as by the Jews' tradition, the morning sacrifice was killed at the northwest horn of the altar (h): <p>and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar; See Gill on <a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>. <p>(g) In Misn.

No doubt the same place is meant in both cases, but it is specified with more exactness here. On the western side of the altar was the tabernacle, on the east side the heap of ashes (<a href="/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a>), on the south side probably the ascent to the altar (see Josephus, 'De Bell.

The slaughtering took place "before Jehovah" (see <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>), or, according to the more precise account in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>, on the side of the altar northward, for which the expression "before the door of the tabernacle" is sometimes used (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-13.htm">Leviticus 3:13</a>, etc.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; (a young ox) is applied to a calf (&#1506;&#1490;&#1500;) in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-2.htm">Leviticus 9:2</a>, and a mature young bull (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;) in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a>.

At the slaughtering the blood was caught by the priests (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-22.htm">2 Chronicles 29:22</a>), and sprinkled upon the altar. When the sacrifices were very numerous, as at the yearly feasts, the Levites helped to catch the blood (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>); but the sprinkling upon the altar was always performed by the priests alone. In the case of the burnt-offerings, the blood was swung "against the altar round about," i.e., against all four sides (walls) of the altar (not "over the surface of the altar"); i.e., it was poured out of the vessel against the walls of the altar with a swinging motion. This was also done when peace-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>, <a href="/leviticus/3-13.htm">Leviticus 3:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-18.htm">Leviticus 9:18</a>) and trespass-offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>) were sacrificed; but it was not so with the sin-offering (see at <a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5</a>).</body></html>
