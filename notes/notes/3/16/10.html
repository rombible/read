As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On which the lot fell to be the scapegoat - Rather, on which the lot 'for Azazel' fell.<p>An atonement with him - The goat "for Azazel" was to be considered as taking his part along with the other goat in the great symbol of atonement.<p>For a scapegoat into the wilderness - Rather, "to Azazel, into the wilderness." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-10. shall take of the congregation &#8230; two kids of the goats &#8230; and one ram&#8212;The sacrifices were to be offered by the high priest, respectively for himself and the other priests, as well as for the people. The bullock (Le 16:3) and the goats were for sin offerings and the rams for burnt offerings. The goats, though used in different ways, constituted only one offering. They were both presented before the Lord, and the disposal of them determined by lot, which Jewish writers have thus described: The priest, placing one of the goats on his right hand and the other on his left, took his station by the altar, and cast into an urn two pieces of gold exactly similar, inscribed, the one with the words "for the Lord," and the other for "Azazel" (the scapegoat). After having well shaken them together, he put both his hands into the box and took up a lot in each: that in his right hand he put on the head of the goat which stood on his right, and that in his left he dropped on the other. In this manner the fate of each was decided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To make an atonement with him, in manner hereafter expressed <span class="bld"> Le 16 21,22</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat,.... Or for Azazel, of which more hereafter in the latter part of the verse: <p>shall be presented alive before the Lord; this seems to be a second presentation; both the goats were presented before the Lord before the lots were cast, <a href="/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7</a>; but this was afterwards, when one of the goats, according to the lot, being presented, was ordered to be killed for a sin offering, and the other according to the lot being presented alive, was ordered to remain so: <p>to make an atonement with him; to make an atonement for the sins of the people of Israel along with the other, for they both made one sin offering, <a href="/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a>; and this, though spared alive for a while, yet at length was killed; and how, the Jewish writers relate, as will be after observed: <p>and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness; or, unto Azazel into the wilderness; which, some understand of a mountain in the wilderness called Azazel, to which the Targum of Jonathan has respect, which paraphrases the word,"to send him to die in a place strong and hard, which is in the wilderness of Zuck;''and so Saadiah Gaon, Jarchi, Kimchi, and others; and one in Aben Ezra says, it was near Mount Sinai; but as it is rightly observed by some, was this the name of a mountain, Moses would have called it the mountain Azazel, as he does other mountains by their names: nor is there any account of any such mountain in those parts, by such who have travelled in it, and if near Sinai, it was a long way to send it from Jerusalem; and for which there seems to be no reason, since there were many deserts between those two places: Aben Ezra suggests, there is a secret or mystery in the word Azazel, and says, you may know it and the mystery of his name, for he has companions in Scripture; and I will reveal to you, says he, part of it by a hint, when you are the son of thirty three, you may know its meaning, that is, by reckoning thirty three verses from <a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a>; where this word is first mentioned, which will fall on <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>; "they shall no more offer unto devils"; and so R. Menachem interprets Azazel of Samael, the angel of death, the devil, the prince that hath power over desolate places: there are several Christian writers of great note, that understand this of the devil, as Origen (b), among the ancients; and of the moderns, Cocceius (c), Witsius (d), and Spencer (e), who think that by these two goats is signified the twofold respect of Christ our Mediator; one to God, as a Judge, to whom he made satisfaction by his death; the other to the devil, the enemy with whom he conflicted in life; who, according to prophecy, was to be delivered up to Satan, and have his heel bruised by him; and who was to come, and did come into the wilderness of this world, and when Jerusalem was a desert, and became a Roman province; and who was led by the Spirit into wilderness of Judea, in a literal sense, to be tempted of the devil, and had a sore conflict with him in the garden, when he sweat, as it were, drops of blood; and upon the cross, when he submitted to the death of it; during which time he had the sins of all his people on him, and made an end of them, so as to be seen no more; all which agrees with <a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>; of which see more there; and it must be owned, that no other sense seems so well to agree with the type as this; since the living goat had all the sins of the people on him, and was reckoned so impure, that he that led him into the wilderness stood in need of washing and cleansing, <a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>; whereas, when Christ was raised from the dead, he was clear of all sin, being justified in the Spirit; and in his resurrection there was no impurity, nor could any be reckoned or supposed to belong to him, as Witsius well observes, no, not as the surety of his people; nor in his resurrection was he a sin offering, as this goat was; nor could his ascension to heaven, with any propriety, be represented by this goat being let go into the wilderness: as for the notion of Barabbas, as Origen (f), being meant by Azazel, or the rebellious people of the Jews, carried into the wilderness, or into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, and which is the sense of Abarbinel, and in which he is followed by many Christian writers, they need no confutation. <p>(b) Contr.

He was to bring an ox (bullock) for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for himself and his house (i.e., the priesthood, <a href="/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a>), and two he-goats for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering, as a sacrifice for the congregation. For this purpose he was to put on, not the state-costume of the high priest, but a body-coat, drawers, girdle, and head-dress of white cloth (bad: see <a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>), having first bathed his body, and not merely his hands and feet, as he did for the ordinary service, to appear before Jehovah as entirely cleansed from the defilement of sin (see at <a href="/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>) and arrayed in clothes of holiness. The dress of white cloth was not the plain official dress of the ordinary priests, for the girdle of that dress was coloured (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-40</a>); and in that case the high priest would not have appeared in the perfect purity of his divinely appointed office as chief of the priesthood, but simply as the priest appointed for this day (v. Hoffmann). Nor did he officiate (as many of the Rabbins, and also C. a Lapide, Grotius, Rosenmller, and Knobel suppose) as a penitent praying humbly for the forgiveness of sin. For where in all the world have clear white clothes been worn either in mourning or as a penitential garment? The emphatic expression, "these are holy garments," is a sufficient proof that the pure white colour of all the clothes, even of the girdle, was intended as a representation of holiness. Although in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, etc., the official dress not only of Aaron, but of his sons also, that is to say, the priestly costume generally, is described as "holy garments," yet in the present chapter the word kodesh, "holy," is frequently used in an emphatic sense (for example, in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>, of the most holy place of the dwelling), and by this predicate the dress is characterized as most holy. Moreover, it was in baddim ("linen") that the angel of Jehovah was clothed (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2-3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/9-11.htm">Ezekiel 9:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Ezekiel 10:6-7</a>, and <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6-7</a>), whose whole appearance, as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, resembled the appearance of the glory of Jehovah, which Ezekiel saw in the vision of the four cherubim (ch. 1), and was almost exactly like the glory of Jesus Christ, which John saw in the Revelation (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-15</a>). The white material, therefore, of the dress which Aaron wore, when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament, was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of His nature, effected by Himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by His own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us, and obtain everlasting redemption (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). </body></html>
