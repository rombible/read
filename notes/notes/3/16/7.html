As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall offer - Rather, shall present, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a>, etc. The word expresses the formal act of placing the victims in front of the entrance of the tabernacle.<p>For himself, and for his house - i. e. for himself as the high priest and all the common priests.

The bullock (Le 16:3) and the goats were for sin offerings and the rams for burnt offerings. The goats, though used in different ways, constituted only one offering. They were both presented before the Lord, and the disposal of them determined by lot, which Jewish writers have thus described: The priest, placing one of the goats on his right hand and the other on his left, took his station by the altar, and cast into an urn two pieces of gold exactly similar, inscribed, the one with the words "for the Lord," and the other for "Azazel" (the scapegoat). After having well shaken them together, he put both his hands into the box and took up a lot in each: that in his right hand he put on the head of the goat which stood on his right, and that in his left he dropped on the other. In this manner the fate of each was decided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall take the two goats,....

After this, Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">cast lots upon the two goats.</span> The two goats, of the same size and appearance as far as possible, stood together near the entrance of the court. And by them was an urn containing two lots. These the high priest drew out at the same moment, placing one on the head of one goat, the other on the head of the other goat. According as the lot fell. one of the goats was taken and at once offered to the Lord, with a view to being shortly sacrificed; the other was appointed for a scapegoat, and reserved till the expiatory sacrifices had been made, when it too was offered to the Lord, and then sent away into the wilderness. After the lot had been chosen, the two goats were distinguished from each other by having a piece of scarlet cloth tied, the first round its neck, the second round its horn. <span class="cmt_word">One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</span> The last word is in the original <span class="accented">la-azazel</span>, and being found only in this chapter, it has caused a great discrepancy of opinion among interpreters as to its meaning. It has been diversely regarded as a place, a person, a thing, and an abstraction. The first class of interpreters explain it as some district of the wilderness; the second understand by it an evil spirit; the third take it as a designation of the goat; the fourth translate it, "for removal." The first interpretation may be summarily rejected. If a localized spot were meant, that spot would have been left behind by a people constantly on the move. The second hypothesis - that <span class="accented">azazel</span> was an evil spirit, or the evil spirit - has been embraced by so considerable a number of modern expositors, that it is necessary to dwell upon it at some length. But, indeed, it has little to recommend it. It has been argued that <span class="accented">azazel</span> must be a proper name, because it has no article prefixed to it, <span class="accented">la-azazel.</span> This is a grammatical error. When a noun expresses an office or a function, and has the preposition <span class="accented">le</span> or <span class="accented">la</span> prefixed to it, it does not take an article in Hebrew any more than in French; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the verse, "Jehu...  shalt thou anoint to be king (or for king) over Israel; and Elisha...  shalt thou appoint to be prophet (or for prophet) in thy room" (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>), the Hebrew is <span class="accented">le-melek</span> and <span class="accented">le-navi</span>, without the article. The same idiom will be found in <a href="/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>. With greater plausibility it is argued that verse 8 contrasts Jehovah and Azazel, and that if <span class="accented">la-Yehovah</span> be translated "for Jehovah," or "for the Lord," <span class="accented">la-azazel</span> must be translated "for Azazel." It may be allowed that there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> likelihood that, where words are thus contrasted, if one designates a person, the other would designate a person. But it is an incredibly rash assertion that this is always the case. All depends upon the idea which the speaker or writer has in his mind and desires to express. As part of the same argument, it is urged that the preposition, being the same in both clauses of the sentence, must be translated by the same word. This is certainly not the case. The natural meaning of <span class="accented">le</span> with a proper name is "for," and with a word expressing the performance of some function (technically called <span class="accented">nomen agentis</span>) it means "to be" (see the passage quoted above from <a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). Unless, therefore, <span class="accented">azazel</span> be a proper name (which has to be proved, not assumed)the preposition need not and ought not to be translated by "for" but by "to be." The word <span class="accented">le</span> is used with great latitude, and often in a different sense in the same sentence; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>. The objections to the theory that <span class="accented">azazel</span> means an evil spirit are of overwhelming force. It will be enough to name the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The name <span class="accented">azazel</span> is nowhere else mentioned. This could not be, if he were so important a being as to divide with Jehovah the sin offering of the congregation of Israel on the great Day of Atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> No suitable etymology can be discerned. The nearest approach to it is very forced - "the separated one." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The notion of appeasing, or bribing, or mocking the evil spirit by presenting to him a goat, is altogether alien from the spirit of the rest of the Mosaic institutions. Where else is there anything like it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The goat is presented and offered to Jehovah equally with the goat which is slain. To take that which has been offered (and therefore half sacrificed) to God and give it to Satan, would be a daring impiety, which is inconceivable. That <span class="accented">la-azazel</span> means "for removal" is the opinion of Bahr, Tholuck, Winer, and others. There is nothing objectionable in this interpretation, but the form of the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> points rather to an agent than to an abstract act. <span class="accented">Azazel</span> is a word softened (according to a not unusual custom) from <span class="accented">azalzel</span>, just as <span class="accented">kokav</span> is a softened form of <span class="accented">kay-kay</span>, and as Babel is derived from Balbel (<a href="/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>). <span class="accented">Azalzel is</span> an active participle or participial noun, derived ultimately from <span class="accented">azal</span> (connected with the Arabic word <span class="accented">azala</span>, and meaning removed), but immediately from the reduplicate form of that verb, <span class="accented">azazal.</span> The reduplication of the consonants of the root in Hebrew and Arabic gives the force of repetition, so that while <span class="accented">azal</span> means removed, <span class="accented">azalzal</span> means removed by a repetition of acts. <span class="accented">Azalzel</span>, or <span class="accented">azazel</span>, therefore, means one who removes by a series of acts. <span class="accented">"In</span> this sense the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> is strictly expressive of the function which is ascribed to the scapegoat in verses 21, 22; namely, that he <span class="accented">be sent away, bearing upon him all the iniquities of the children of Israel into the wilderness.'</span> It properly denotes one that removes or separates; yet a remover in such sort that the removal is not effected by a single act or at one moment, but by a series of minor acts tending to and issuing in a complete removal. No word could better express the movement of the goat before the eyes of the people, as it passed on, removing at each step, in a visible symbol, their sins further and further from them, until, by continued repetition of the movement, they were carried far away and removed utterly" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). That it is the goat that is designated by the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> is the exposition of the LXX., Josephus, Symmachus, Aquila, Theodotion, the Vulgate, the Authorized English Version, and Luther's Version. The interpretation is founded on sound etymological grounds, it suits the context wherever the word occurs, it is consistent with the remaining ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and it accords with the otherwise known religious beliefs and symbolical practices of the Israelites. The two goats were the single sin offering for the people; the one that was offered in sacrifice symbolized atonement or covering made by shedding of blood, the other symbolized the utter removal of the sins of the people, which were conveyed away and lost in the depths of the wilderness, whence there was no return. Cf. <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us;" and <a href="/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>, "He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea." The eighth verse should be translated as it stands in the Authorized Version, or, if we ask for still greater exactness, <span class="accented">And Aaron shall east lots upon the two goats</span>; <span class="accented">one lot for the Lord, and one lot for a remover of sins.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The chronological link connecting the following law with the death of the sons of Aaron (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-5</a>) was intended, not only to point out the historical event which led to the appointment of the day of atonement, but also to show the importance and holiness attached to an entrance into the inmost sanctuary of God. The death of Aaron's sons, as a punishment for wilfully "drawing near before Jehovah," was to be a solemn warning to Aaron himself, "not to come at all times into the holy place within the vail, before the mercy-seat upon the ark," i.e., into the most holy place (see <a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>.), but only at the time to be appointed by Jehovah, and for the purposes instituted by Him, i.e., according to <a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>., only once a year, on the day of atonement, and only in the manner prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>., that he might not die. - "For I will appear in the cloud above the capporeth." The cloud in which Jehovah appeared above the capporeth, between the cherubim (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>), was not the cloud of the incense, with which Aaron was to cover the capporeth on entering (<a href="/leviticus/16-13.htm">Leviticus 16:13</a>), as Vitringa, Bhr, and others follow the Sadducees in supposing, but the cloud of the divine glory, in which Jehovah manifested His essential presence in the most holy place above the ark of the covenant. Because Jehovah appeared in this cloud, not only could no unclean and sinful man go before the capporeth, i.e., approach the holiness of the all-holy God; but even the anointed and sanctified high priest, if he went before it at his own pleasure, or without the expiatory blood of sacrifice, would expose himself to certain death. The reason for this prohibition is to be found in the fact, that the holiness communicated to the priest did not cancel the sin of his nature, but only covered it over for the performance of his official duties, and so long as the law, which produced only the knowledge of sin and not its forgiveness and removal, was not abolished by the complete atonement, the holy God was and remained to mortal and sinful man a consuming fire, before which no one could stand. </body></html>
