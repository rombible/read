As long as we are continually sinning, we continually need the atonement. The law of afflicting our souls for sin, is a statue which will continue in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as a proof that the sacrifices could not take away sin, and cleanse the conscience from it, that in them there was a remembrance made of sin every year, upon the day of atonement, Heb 10:1,3. The repeating the sacrifices, showed there was in them but a feeble effort toward making atonement; this could be done only by offering up the body of Christ once for all; and that sacrifice needed not to be repeated.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Holy place - This name here denotes the sanctuary, the whole sacred enclosure, the court of the tabernacle.

He was not to attire himself on that occasion in the splendid robes that were proper to his sacred office, but in a plain dress of linen, like the common Levites, for, as he was then to make atonement for his own sins, as well as for those of the people, he was to appear in the humble character of a suppliant. That plain dress was more in harmony with a season of humiliation (as well as lighter and more convenient for the duties which on that occasion he had singly to perform) than the gorgeous robes of the pontificate. It showed that when all appeared as sinners, the highest and lowest were then on a level, and that there is no distinction of persons with God [Ac 10:34].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thus; </span> in this manner, or upon these terms. <span class="ital">With a young bullock</span>, i.e. with the blood of it, as it is explained <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/16-14.htm" title="And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.">Leviticus 16:14</a></span>.

The most holy place; and this was after he had offered the daily sacrifice of the morning, and had performed the rest of the service then done, as Gersom observes; such as burning the incense and trimming the lamps, for no offering preceded the daily sacrifice: <p>with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering; which were both for himself and his family; and such were the weakness, imperfection, and insufficiency of the Levitical priesthood, and priests, that they were obliged first to offer for their own sins, and then for the sins of the people: the meaning is not, as Aben Ezra says, that he should bring the bullock into the holy place, only that he should first give of his own a bullock for a sin offering, to atone for himself, and for the priests; nor could it be the body of the bullock he brought, only the blood of it into the most holy place, where he entered not without blood, first with the blood of the bullock, and then with the blood of the goat; for the body of the bullock for a sin offering was burnt without the camp, and the body of the ram for the burnt offering was burnt upon the altar of burnt offering; see <a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">Herewith</span>] with the offerings and ceremonies set forth in what follows.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus shall Aaron come into the holy</span> place.

The efficacy of the acts of the high priest on this day and throughout his ministrations depended not upon his individual but on his official character, and on his obedience to the various commandments positively enjoined. Personal worthiness would not qualify him for his service, nor personal unworthiness hinder the effect of his liturgical acts (cf. Art. 26, 'Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament'). Aaron's special offerings for himself on this great day are to be a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the issue had ceased, she was to purify herself like the man with an issue, as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13-15</a>. - Obedience to these commands is urged in <a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a> : "Cause that the children of Israel free themselves from their uncleanness, that they die not through their uncleanness, by defiling My dwelling in the midst of them." &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, Hiphil, to cause that a person keeps aloof from anything, or loosens himself from it, from &#1504;&#1494;&#1512;, Niphal to separate one's self, signifies here deliverance from the state of uncleanness, purification from it. Continuance in it was followed by death, not merely in the particular instance in which an unclean man ventured to enter the sanctuary, but as a general fact, because uncleanness as irreconcilable with the calling of Israel to be a holy nation, in the midst of which Jehovah the Holy One had His dwelling-place (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>), and continuance in uncleanness without the prescribed purification was a disregard of the holiness of Jehovah, and involved rebellion against Him and His ordinances of grace. </body></html>
