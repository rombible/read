Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In this first complete series of offerings made by the high priest, the sacrifices take their appointed order; first, the sin-offering to make atonement; then the burnt-offering, to signify the surrender of the body, soul and spirit to Yahweh in heaven; and lastly the peace-offering, to show forth the communion vouchsafed to those who are justified and sanctified.

They could not bear their own sins: and therefore, instead of eating any part of their own sin offering, as they were at liberty to do in the case of the people's offering, they had to carry the whole carcasses "without the camp and burn them with fire" [Ex 29:14; Le 4:12].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the breasts and the right shoulder,....

The blood of this sin-offering, which was presented for the congregation, was not brought into the holy place according to the rule laid down in <a href="/leviticus/7-16.htm">Leviticus 7:16</a>., but only applied to the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; for the same reason as in the previous case (<a href="/leviticus/9-8.htm">Leviticus 9:8</a>.), viz., because the object was not to expiate any particular sin, or the sins of the congregation that had been committed in the course of time and remained unatoned for, but simply to place the sacrificial service of the congregation in its proper relation to the Lord. Aaron was reproved by Moses, however, for having burned the flesh (<a href="/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16</a>.), but was able to justify it (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16-20</a>). The sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>) was also offered "according to the right" (as in <a href="/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>). Then followed the meat-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), of which Aaron burned a handful upon the altar (according to the rule in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>). He offered this in addition to the morning burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/29-39.htm">Exodus 29:39</a>), to which a meat-offering also belonged (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>), and with which, according to <a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>., the special meat-offering of the priests was associated. Last of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-18.htm">Leviticus 9:18-21</a>) there followed the peace-offering, which was also carried out according to the general rule. In &#1492;&#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, "the covering" (<a href="/leviticus/9-19.htm">Leviticus 9:19</a>), the two fat portions mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3</a> are included. The fat portions were laid upon the breast-pieces by the sons of Aaron, and then handed by them to Aaron, the fat to be burned upon the altar, the breast to be waved along with the right leg, according to the instructions in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-36</a>. The meat-offering of pastry, which belonged to the peace-offering according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-13</a>, is not specially mentioned. </body></html>
