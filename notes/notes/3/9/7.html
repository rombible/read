Hence, the remark of the Apostle, “And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron; so also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest, but he that said. unto him,” &c. (<a href="/context/hebrews/5-4.htm" title="And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.">Hebrews 5:4-5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Make atonement for thyself and the people.</span>—The fact that these sacrifices which the high priest is to bring are here described as designed to make atonement for himself and the people, goes far to confirm the ancient interpretation that reference is here made to the particular sin which Aaron and the people committed in common, and that it is the sin of the golden calf (see <a href="/leviticus/9-2.htm" title="And he said to Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.">Leviticus 9:2</a>), which is so emphatically described in the words “they made the calf which Aaron made” (<a href="/exodus/32-35.htm" title="And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.">Exodus 32:35</a>). Hence, whilst their share of the sin is to be atoned by a special sacrifice (see <a href="/leviticus/9-15.htm" title="And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.">Leviticus 9:15</a>), they are yet to participate in the atoning virtue of Aaron’s sacrifice because they prevailed on him to make the calf (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm" title="And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.">Exodus 32:1</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-21 These many sacrifices, which were all done away by the death of Christ, teach us that our best services need washing in his blood, and that the guilt of our best sacrifices needs to be done away by one more pure and more noble than they. Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is to be remarked that Aaron offers no peace-offering for himself. It was enough that he should participate in the peace-offerings of the consecration <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>, and in the two peace-offerings about to be sacrificed for the people.<p>His sin-offering was probably regarded not so much as a sacrifice for his own actual sins as a typical acknowledgment of his sinful nature and of his future duty to offer for his own sins and those of the People.

The Priests' Entry into Office.<p>1-7. Moses called &#8230; Take thee a young calf for a sin offering&#8212;The directions in these sacred things were still given by Moses, the circumstances being extraordinary. But he was only the medium of communicating the divine will to the newly made priests. The first of their official acts was the sacrifice of another sin offering to atone for the defects of the inauguration services; and yet that sacrifice did not consist of a bullock&#8212;the sacrifice appointed for some particular transgression, but of a calf, perhaps not without a significant reference to Aaron's sin in the golden calf [Ex 32:22-24]. Then followed a burnt offering, expressive of their voluntary and entire self-devotement to the divine service. The newly consecrated priests having done this on their own account, they were called to offer a sin offering and burnt offering for the people, ending the ceremonial by a peace offering, which was a sacred feast. This injunction, "to make atonement for himself and for the people" (Septuagint, "for thy family"), at the commencement of his sacred functions, furnishes a striking evidence of the divine origin of the Jewish system of worship. In all false or corrupt forms of religion, the studied policy has been to inspire the people with an idea of the sanctity of the priesthood as in point of purity and favor with the Divinity far above the level of other men. But among the Hebrews the priests were required to offer for the expiation of their own sins as well as the humblest of the people. This imperfection of Aaron's priesthood, however, does not extend to the gospel dispensation: for our great High Priest, who has entered for us into "the true tabernacle," "knew no sin" (Heb 10:10, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Moses had hitherto sacrificed, but now he resigneth his work to Aaron, and actually gives him that commission which from God he had received for him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The order is very observable, first for thyself, otherwise thou art unfit to do it for the people.

This is only observed to show, that as Aaron did not take upon him this office of himself, but was called unto it, and invested with it, by the appointment of God, so neither did he enter upon it but through the call of God by Moses, in the sight of the congregation: <p>go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering; the young calf and ram: <p>and make an atonement for thyself and for the people; first for himself, and then for the people; for, as Aben Ezra says, a man cannot atone for another until he is pure from all sin; which is a character only to be found in Christ, our great High Priest, and so a proper person to atone for and take away the sins of others: hence the priests under the law, with their sacrifices, could never take away sin really, only typically; and this shows the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood, that the priests of that order were obliged to offer first for their own sins; this our high priest, of another order, needed not to do; see <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>. <p>and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; typical of the true and full atonement made by Christ, when he offered himself without spot to God: <p>as the Lord commanded; Aaron to do, and as he commanded Christ, his Son and our surety, the antitype of Aaron, <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</span><p>(d) Read for the understanding of this peace, He 4:5,7:27.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">and for the people</span>] LXX. has ‘and for thy house’ as in <a href="/leviticus/16-11.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:">Leviticus 16:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-17.htm" title="And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.">Leviticus 16:17</a>.

On the eighth day, i.e., on the day after the seven days' consecration, Aaron and his sons entered upon their duties with a solemn sacrifice for themselves and the nation, to which the Lord had made Himself known by a special revelation of His glory, to bear solemn witness before the whole nation that their service at the altar was acceptable to Him, and to impress the divine seal of confirmation upon the consecration they had received. To this end Aaron and his sons were to bring to the front of the tabernacle a young calf as a sin-offering for themselves, and a ram for a burnt-offering; and the people were to bring through their elders a he-goat for a sin-offering, a yearling calf and yearling sheep for a burnt-offering, and an ox and ram for a peace-offering, together with a meat-offering of meal mixed with oil; and the congregation (in the persons of its elders) was to stand there before Jehovah, i.e., to assemble together at the sanctuary for the solemn transaction (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1-5</a>). If, according to this, even after the manifold expiation and consecration, which Aaron had received through Moses during the seven days, he had still to enter upon his service with a sin-offering and burnt-offering, this fact clearly showed that the offerings of the law could not ensure perfection (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>.). It is true that on this occasion a young calf was sufficient for a sin-offering for the priests, not a mature ox as in <a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a> and <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>; and so also for the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings of the people smaller sacrifices sufficed, either smaller in kind or fewer in number than at the leading feasts (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11</a>.). Nevertheless, not one of the three sacrifices could be omitted; and if no special peace-offering was required of Aaron, this may be accounted for from the fact, that the whole of the sacrificial ceremony terminated with a national peace-offering, in which the priests took part, uniting in this instance with the rest of the nation in the celebration of a common sacrificial meal, to make known their oneness with them. </body></html>
