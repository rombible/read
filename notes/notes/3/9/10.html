Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aaron did not act according to the ordinary Law <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-5.htm">Leviticus 4:5-7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-16.htm">Leviticus 4:16-18</a>, but as Moses had done in the sin-offering of the consecration ceremony (<a href="/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>; compare also <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-25.htm">Leviticus 4:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-30.htm">Leviticus 4:30</a>, <a href="/leviticus/4-34.htm">Leviticus 4:34</a>).

On the eighth day, i.e., on the day after the seven days' consecration, Aaron and his sons entered upon their duties with a solemn sacrifice for themselves and the nation, to which the Lord had made Himself known by a special revelation of His glory, to bear solemn witness before the whole nation that their service at the altar was acceptable to Him, and to impress the divine seal of confirmation upon the consecration they had received. To this end Aaron and his sons were to bring to the front of the tabernacle a young calf as a sin-offering for themselves, and a ram for a burnt-offering; and the people were to bring through their elders a he-goat for a sin-offering, a yearling calf and yearling sheep for a burnt-offering, and an ox and ram for a peace-offering, together with a meat-offering of meal mixed with oil; and the congregation (in the persons of its elders) was to stand there before Jehovah, i.e., to assemble together at the sanctuary for the solemn transaction (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1-5</a>). If, according to this, even after the manifold expiation and consecration, which Aaron had received through Moses during the seven days, he had still to enter upon his service with a sin-offering and burnt-offering, this fact clearly showed that the offerings of the law could not ensure perfection (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>.). It is true that on this occasion a young calf was sufficient for a sin-offering for the priests, not a mature ox as in <a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a> and <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>; and so also for the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings of the people smaller sacrifices sufficed, either smaller in kind or fewer in number than at the leading feasts (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11</a>.). Nevertheless, not one of the three sacrifices could be omitted; and if no special peace-offering was required of Aaron, this may be accounted for from the fact, that the whole of the sacrificial ceremony terminated with a national peace-offering, in which the priests took part, uniting in this instance with the rest of the nation in the celebration of a common sacrificial meal, to make known their oneness with them. </body></html>
