Let us be thankful that we have such a High Priest. The priests had not a day's respite from service allowed. God's spiritual priests have constant work, which the duty of every day requires; they that would give up their account with joy, must redeem time. The glory of God appeared in the sight of the people, and owned what they had done. We are not now to expect such appearances, but God draws nigh to those who draw nigh to him, and the offerings of faith are acceptable to him; though the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the acceptance are spiritual likewise. When Aaron had done all that was to be done about the sacrifices, he lifted up his hands towards the people, and blessed them. Aaron could but crave a blessing, God alone can command it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In this first complete series of offerings made by the high priest, the sacrifices take their appointed order; first, the sin-offering to make atonement; then the burnt-offering, to signify the surrender of the body, soul and spirit to Yahweh in heaven; and lastly the peace-offering, to show forth the communion vouchsafed to those who are justified and sanctified.

The Sin-Offering for the people is offered ‘as the first’ i.e. in the same way as Aaron’s Sin-Offering; the blood is not brought into the tabernacle, and the sacrifice is wholly consumed. This treatment gives rise to the question of <a href="/leviticus/10-16.htm" title="And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,">Leviticus 10:16</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-21.</span> - The people's sin offering, burnt off, ring, meat offering, and peace offerings follow. The meat offering is said to have been <span class="cmt_word">burnt upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning</span>. It is probable that, on this occasion, the people's burnt offering, which consisted of a calf and a lamb, took the place of the ordinary morning sacrifice of a lamb (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38</a>). Aaron is said to have <span class="cmt_word">offered the burnt offering according to the manner</span>, or, as it is given in the margin, <span class="accented">ordinance</span>, that is, he burnt the flesh on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7-9</a>); he also <span class="cmt_word">burnt</span> the <span class="cmt_word">handful</span> of the meat offering, and he <span class="cmt_word">burnt the fat</span> of the peace offering, <span class="cmt_word">upon the altar</span>. He had previously burnt the fat of his own sin offering, and the flesh of his burnt offering. Fire, therefore, was present upon the altar, and was used by Aaron, as by Moses, for sacrificial purposes <span class="accented">before</span> the fire came out from the Lord as described in verse 24. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Accordingly, he offered first of all the sin-offering and burnt-offering for himself, and then (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15-21</a>) the offerings of the people. The sin-offering always went first, because it served to remove the estrangement of man from the holy God arising from sin, by means of the expiation of the sinner, and to clear away the hindrances to his approach to God. Then followed the burnt-offering, as an expression of the complete surrender of the person expiated to the Lord; and lastly the peace-offering, on the one hand as the utterance of thanksgiving for mercy received, and prayer for its further continuance, and on the other hand, as a seal of covenant fellowship with the Lord in the sacrificial meal. But when Moses says in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>, that Aaron is to make atonement for himself and the nation with his sin-offering and burnt-offering, the atoning virtue which Aaron's sacrifice was to have for the nation also, referred not to sins which the people had committed, but to the guilt which the high priest, as the head of the whole congregation, had brought upon the nation by his sin (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). In offering the sacrifices, Aaron was supported by his sons, who handed him the blood to sprinkle, and the sacrificial portions to burn upon the altar. The same course was adopted with Aaron's sin-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-8.htm">Leviticus 9:8-11</a>) as Moses had pursued with the sin-offering at the consecration of the priests (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14-17</a>). The blood was not taken into the sanctuary, but only applied to the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; because the object was not to expiate some particular sin of Aaron's, but to take away the sin which might make his service on behalf of the congregation displeasing to God; and the communion of the congregation with the Lord was carried on at the altar of burnt-offering. The flesh and skin of the animal were burnt outside the camp, as in the case of all the sin-offerings for the priesthood (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-11.htm">Leviticus 4:11-12</a>). </body></html>
