In accordance with the remark in the passage before us, they are obliged to turn their faces to the people. In lifting up their hands above their shoulders, stretching them forward towards the worshippers, each priest joins his hands together by the thumbs and the two forefingers, separating the other two fingers so as to produce a triple division.

There came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed the sacrifice. This fire might justly have fastened upon the people, and have consumed them for their sins; but its consuming the sacrifice signified God's acceptance of it, as an atonement for the sinner. This also was a figure of good things to come. The Spirit descended upon the apostles in fire. And the descent of this holy fire into our souls, to kindle in them pious and devout affections toward God, and such a holy zeal as burns up the flesh and the lusts of it, is a certain token of God's gracious acceptance of our persons and performances. Nothing goes to God, but what comes from him. We must have grace, that holy fire, from the God of grace, else we cannot serve him acceptably, Heb 12:28. The people were affected with this discovery of God's glory and grace. They received it with the highest joy; triumphing in the assurance given them that they had God nigh unto them. And with the lowest reverence; humbly adoring the majesty of that God, who vouchsafed thus to manifest himself to them. That is a sinful fear of God, which drives us from him; a gracious fear makes us bow before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aaron having completed the offerings, before he came down from the stage surrounding the altar on which the priests used to stand to officiate (see <a href="/exodus/27-8.htm">Exodus 27:8</a>), turned toward the people, and blessed them; probably using the form which became the established one for the priests <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, and which is still maintained in the synagogues. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

After he had offered the above sacrifices both for himself and them: the manner of the priests lifting up their hands when they blessed is thus described; in the provinces the priests lift up their hands to their shoulders, and in the sanctuary above their heads, excepting the high priest, who did not lift up his hands above the plate of gold: but R. Judah says, the high priest lift up his hands above the plate, as it is said <a href="/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22</a> (f); the modern Jews describe it thus (g), they lift up their hands to their shoulders, and they lift up the right hand somewhat higher than the left; then they stretch out their hands, and part their fingers, and frame them so as to make five airs; between two fingers and two fingers one air, and between the forefinger and the thumb, and between the two thumbs; they spread out their hands so, that the middle (or palm) of the hand may be towards the earth, and the back part of it towards heaven: Aaron lift his hands upwards, signifying from whence he implored the blessing, and towards the people on whom he desired it might descend; in this was a type of Christ, who, after he had offered himself a sacrifice for the sins of his people, when he was risen from the dead and about to ascend to heaven, blessed his disciples, <a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a> in Christ the saints are blessed with all spiritual blessings; by him they are procured for them, through his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction; and he ever lives to make intercession for the application of them to them, see <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>. <p>and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings; from the altar with joy, as the Targum of Jonathan; being glad he had done his service with acceptance; he is said to "come down", there being a rise or ascent to the altar, which, as Aben Ezra observes, was three cubits high, and therefore it is with propriety said he came down; which he did as soon as he had made an end of offering all the sacrifices. <p>(f) Misn.

The blood of this sin-offering, which was presented for the congregation, was not brought into the holy place according to the rule laid down in <a href="/leviticus/7-16.htm">Leviticus 7:16</a>., but only applied to the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; for the same reason as in the previous case (<a href="/leviticus/9-8.htm">Leviticus 9:8</a>.), viz., because the object was not to expiate any particular sin, or the sins of the congregation that had been committed in the course of time and remained unatoned for, but simply to place the sacrificial service of the congregation in its proper relation to the Lord. Aaron was reproved by Moses, however, for having burned the flesh (<a href="/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16</a>.), but was able to justify it (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16-20</a>). The sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>) was also offered "according to the right" (as in <a href="/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>). Then followed the meat-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), of which Aaron burned a handful upon the altar (according to the rule in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>). He offered this in addition to the morning burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/29-39.htm">Exodus 29:39</a>), to which a meat-offering also belonged (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>), and with which, according to <a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>., the special meat-offering of the priests was associated. Last of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-18.htm">Leviticus 9:18-21</a>) there followed the peace-offering, which was also carried out according to the general rule. In &#1492;&#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, "the covering" (<a href="/leviticus/9-19.htm">Leviticus 9:19</a>), the two fat portions mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3</a> are included. The fat portions were laid upon the breast-pieces by the sons of Aaron, and then handed by them to Aaron, the fat to be burned upon the altar, the breast to be waved along with the right leg, according to the instructions in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-36</a>. The meat-offering of pastry, which belonged to the peace-offering according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-13</a>, is not specially mentioned. </body></html>
