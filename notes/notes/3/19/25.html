It is required that Israel be a holy people, because the God of Israel is a holy God, ver. 2. To teach real separation from the world and the flesh, and entire devotedness to God. This is now the law of Christ; may the Lord bring every thought within us into obedience to it! Children are to be obedient to their parents, ver. 3. The fear here required includes inward reverence and esteem, outward respect and obedience, care to please them and to make them easy. God only is to be worshipped, ver. 4. Turn not from the true God to false ones, from the God who will make you holy and happy, to those that will deceive you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn not your eyes to them, much less your heart. They should leave the gleanings of their harvest and vintage for the poor, ver. 9. Works of piety must be always attended with works of charity, according to our ability. We must not be covetous, griping, and greedy of every thing we can lay claim to, nor insist upon our right in all things. We are to be honest and true in all our dealings, ver. 11. Whatever we have in the world, we must see that we get it honestly, for we cannot be truly rich, or long rich, with that which is not so. Reverence to the sacred name of God must be shown, ver. 12. We must not detain what belongs to another, particularly the wages of the hireling, ver. 13. We must be tender of the credit and safety of those that cannot help themselves, ver. 14. Do no hurt to any, because they are unwilling or unable to avenge themselves. We ought to take heed of doing any thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall. The fear of God should keep us from doing wrong things, though they will not expose us to men's anger. Judges, and all in authority, are commanded to give judgment without partiality, ver. 15. To be a tale-bearer, and to sow discord among neighbours, is as bad an office as a man can put himself into. We are to rebuke our neighbour in love, ver. 17. Rather rebuke him than hate him, for an injury done to thyself. We incur guilt by not reproving; it is hating our brother. We should say, I will do him the kindness to tell him of his faults. We are to put off all malice, and to put on brotherly love, ver. 18. We often wrong ourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves those wrongs, and they do not at all lessen our love to ourselves; in like manner we should love our neighbour. We must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of our neighbour. Ver. 31: For Christians to have their fortunes told, to use spells and charms, or the like, is a sad affront to God. They must be grossly ignorant who ask, What harm is there in these things? Here is a charge to young people to show respect to the aged, ver. 32. Religion teaches good manners, and obliges us to honour those to whom honour is due. A charge was given to the Israelites to be very tender of strangers, ver. 33. Strangers, and the widows and fatherless, are God's particular care. It is at our peril, if we do them any wrong. Strangers shall be welcome to God's grace; we should do what we can to recommend religion to them. Justice in weights and measures is commanded, ver. 35. We must make conscience of obeying God's precepts. We are not to pick and choose our duty, but must aim at standing complete in all the will of God. And the nearer our lives and tempers are to the precepts of God's law, the happier shall we be, and the happier shall we make all around us, and the better shall we adorn the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fruit ... uncircumcised - i. e. unfit for presentation to Yahweh.

Every gardener will teach us not to let fruit trees bear in their earliest years, but to pluck off the blossoms: and for this reason, that they will thus thrive the better, and bear more abundantly afterwards.

This series begins in <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a> with the commandment not to mix the things which are separated in the creation of God. "Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed, or put on a garment of mixed stuff." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; separation, signifies duae res diversi generis, heterogeneae, and is a substantive in the accusative, giving a more precise definition. &#1513;&#1506;&#1496;&#1504;&#1494; is in apposition to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, and according to <a href="/deuteronomy/22-11.htm">Deuteronomy 22:11</a> refers to cloth or a garment woven of wool and flax, to a mixed fabric therefore. The etymology is obscure, and the rendering given by the lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, i.e., forged, not genuine, is probably merely a conjecture based upon the context. The word is probably derived from the Egyptian; although the attempt to explain it from the Coptic has not been so far satisfactory. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9-11</a>, instead of the field, the vineyard is mentioned, as that which they were not to sow with things of two kinds, i.e., so that a mixed produce should arise; and the threat is added, "that thy fulness (full fruit, <a href="/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>), the seed, and the produce of the vineyard (i.e., the corn and wine grown upon the vineyard) may not become holy" (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-10.htm">Leviticus 27:10</a>, <a href="/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>), i.e., fall to the sanctuary for its servants. It is also forbidden to plough with an ox and ass together, i.e., to yoke them to the same plough. By these laws the observance of the natural order and separation of things is made a duty binding upon the Israelites, the people of Jehovah, as a divine ordinance founded in the creation itself (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11-12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-25</a>). All the symbolical, mystical, moral, and utilitarian reasons that have been supposed to lie at the foundation of these commands, are foreign to the spirit of the law. And with regard to the observance of them, the statement of Josephus and the Rabbins, that the dress of the priests, as well as the tapestries and curtains of the tabernacle, consisted of wool and linen, is founded upon the assumption, which cannot be established, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, is a term applied to linen. The mules frequently mentioned, e.g., in <a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>, may have been imported from abroad, as we may conclude from <a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>.</body></html>
