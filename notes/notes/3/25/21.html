(See <a href="/deuteronomy/28-8.htm" title="The LORD shall command the blessing on you in your storehouses, and in all that you set your hand to; and he shall bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 28:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-8.htm" title="Yet the LORD will command his loving kindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer to the God of my life.">Psalm 42:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-4.htm" title="You are my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.">Psalm 44:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-29.htm" title="Because of your temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to you.">Psalm 68:29</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">It shall bring forth fruit for three years.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">it shall bring forth produce. </span>This special blessing will be manifested in the abundant crop of the harvest preceding the sabbatical year. Just as at the institution of the weekly Sabbath, when God enjoined abstention from labour, He sent down a double portion of manna every sixth day to make up for the day of rest (<a href="/context/exodus/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.">Exodus 16:22-27</a>), so He will exercise a special providence every sixth year by blessing the soil with a treble crop to compensate for giving the land a septennial sabbath. As the sabbatical year began the civil year, viz., 1 Tishri, which was in the autumn or in September, the three years here spoken of are to be distributed as follows: (1) the remainder of the sixth year after the harvest; (2) the whole of the seventh year; and (3) the period of the eighth year till the harvest is gathered in from the seeds sown in the eighth year. It will thus be seen that the question anticipated in <a href="/leviticus/25-29.htm" title="And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.">Leviticus 25:29</a>, viz., “What shall we eat the seventh year?” properly applies to the eighth year, since the requirements for the seventh year are supplied by the regular harvest of the sixth year, and it is the eighth year for which the harvest of the seventh is wanted. To meet this difficulty, one of the most distinguished Jewish expositors of the Middle Ages translates <a href="/leviticus/25-20.htm" title="And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:">Leviticus 25:20</a> : “And if ye shall say in the seventh year ‘What shall we eat’” i.e., in the eighth year. It may, however, be that the question expresses the anxiety which the people might feel in eating their ordinary share in the seventh year, lest there should be nothing left for the eighth year, since in all other years the harvest is ripening for the next year whilst the fruits of the past year are being consumed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/25-21.htm" title="Then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.">Leviticus 25:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">For three years — </span>Not completely, but in great part; namely, for that part of the sixth year which was between the beginning of the harvest and the beginning of the seventh year, for the whole seventh year, and for that part of the eighth year which was before the harvest, which reached almost until the beginning of the ninth year. This is added to show the equity of this command. As God would hereby try their faith and obedience, so he gave them an evident proof of his own exact providence and tender care over them in making provisions suitable to their necessities.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:8-22 The word jubilee signifies a peculiarly animated sound of the silver trumpets. This sound was to be made on the evening of the great day of atonement; for the proclamation of gospel liberty and salvation results from the sacrifice of the Redeemer. It was provided that the lands should not be sold away from their families. They could only be disposed of, as it were, by leases till the year of jubilee, and then returned to the owner or his heir. This tended to preserve their tribes and families distinct, till the coming of the Messiah. The liberty every man was born to, if sold or forfeited, should return at the year of jubilee. This was typical of redemption by Christ from the slavery of sin and Satan, and of being brought again to the liberty of the children of God. All bargains ought to be made by this rule, Ye shall not oppress one another, not take advantage of one another's ignorance or necessity, but thou shalt fear thy God. The fear of God reigning in the heart, would restrain from doing wrong to our neighbour in word or deed. Assurance was given that they should be great gainers, by observing these years of rest. If we are careful to do our duty, we may trust God with our comfort. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all neither sowed or reaped. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all God's people, in all ages, to trust him in the way of duty. There is nothing lost by faith and self-denial in obedience. Some asked, What shall we eat the seventh year? Thus many Christians anticipate evils, questioning what they shall do, and fearing to proceed in the way of duty. But we have no right to anticipate evils, so as to distress ourselves about them. To carnal minds we may appear to act absurdly, but the path of duty is ever the path of safety.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In safety - i. e., secure from famine, <a href="/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21, 22. I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years, &c.&#8212;A provision was made, by the special interposition of God, to supply the deficiency of food which would otherwise have resulted from the suspension of all labor during the sabbatic year. The sixth year was to yield a miraculous supply for three continuous years. And the remark is applicable to the year of Jubilee as well as the sabbatic year. (See allusions to this extraordinary provision in 2Ki 19:29; Isa 37:30). None but a legislator who was conscious of acting under divine authority would have staked his character on so singular an enactment as that of the sabbatic year; and none but a people who had witnessed the fulfilment of the divine promise would have been induced to suspend their agricultural preparations on a recurrence of a periodical Jubilee.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Give <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">my blessing.</span> <span class="ital">Commanding</span> is oft used in Scripture either for the performance of promised blessings, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/28-8.htm" title="The LORD shall command the blessing on you in your storehouses, and in all that you set your hand to; and he shall bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Deu 28:8</a> <a href="/psalms/111-9.htm" title="He sent redemption to his people: he has commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.">Psalm 111:9</a> 133:3</span>, or for the execution of threatened judgments, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm" title="And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dig; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.">Isaiah 5:6</a> <a href="/amos/9-4.htm" title="And though they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.">Amos 9:4</a></span>; both being acts of God’s providential will, as the command is of his legislative will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For three years; </span> not completely, but in great part, to wit, for that part of the sixth year which was between the beginning of harvest and the beginning of the seventh year, for the whole seventh year, and for that part of the eighth year which was before the harvest, which reached almost until the beginning of the ninth year.
