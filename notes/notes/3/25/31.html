This was a figure of the free grace of God in Christ; by which, and not by any price or merit of our own, we are restored to the favour of God. Houses in walled cities were more the fruits of their own industry than land in the country, which was the direct gift of God's bounty; therefore if a man sold a house in a city, he might redeem it only within a year after the sale.

But there was a difference between the houses of villages (which, being connected with agriculture, were treated as parts of the land) and houses possessed by trading people or foreigners in walled towns, which could only be redeemed within the year after the sale; if not then redeemed, these did not revert to the former owner at the Jubilee.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The houses of the villages</span> belonged to and were necessary or very convenient for the management of the lands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the houses of the villages, which have no walls round about them,....

In the first place, <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a> contains the general rule, "the land shall not be sold &#1500;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514;" (lit., to annihilation), i.e., so as to vanish away from, or be for ever lost to, the seller. For "the land belongs to Jehovah:" the Israelites, to whom He would give it (<a href="/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2</a>), were not actual owners or full possessors, so that they could do what they pleased with it, but "strangers and sojourners with Jehovah" in His land. Consequently (<a href="/leviticus/25-24.htm">Leviticus 25:24</a>) throughout the whole of the land of their possession they were to grant &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; release, redemption to the land. There were three ways in which this could be done. The first case (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>) was this: if a brother became poor and sold his property, his nearest redeemer was to come and release what his brother had sold, i.e., buy it back from the purchaser and restore it to its former possessor. The nearest redeemer was the relative upon whom this obligation rested according to the series mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-49.htm">Leviticus 25:49</a>. - The second case (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-26.htm">Leviticus 25:26</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-27.htm">Leviticus 25:27</a>) was this: if any one had no redeemer, either because there were no relatives upon whom the obligation rested, or because they were all too poor, and he had earned and acquired sufficient to redeem it, he was to calculate the years of purchase, and return the surplus to the man who had bought it, i.e., as much as he had paid for the years that still remained up to the next year of jubilee, that so he might come into possession of it again. As the purchaser had only paid the amount of the annual harvests till the next year of jubilee, all that he could demand back was as much as he had paid for the years that still remained.</body></html>
