We are to exercise willing dependence on God's providence for our support; to consider ourselves the Lord's tenants or stewards, and to use our possessions accordingly.

The rest year was a transference to the <span class="ital">land</span> of the sabbatical idea emphasized each week for <span class="ital">living creatures</span>, the year being now taken as the unit instead of the day. See App. I, pp. 172 f. for the difference in standpoint between this and the parallel ordinances elsewhere in the Hexateucb, as indicating modifications of the same law in successive periods.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The seventh year is to bear the same relation to the six preceding years as the sabbath to the six preceding days of the week. The parallel between the land and the bondman was close. The divinely appointed seventh day of rest is to be kept holy by abstaining from work, so the land shall keep every seventh year holy to the Lord by resting from all work. It cannot be wholly inactive, but nothing is to be done which will cause the land to put forth its full strength. By a curtailment of the full powers bestowed upon man and land by their Creator both were to keep holy a season to the Lord. In <a href="/context/exodus/23-10.htm" title="And six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in the fruits thereof:...">Exodus 23:10-11</a> the fallow year is regarded as a provision for the poor and part of the animal creation, while the religious idea underlies the injunctions of the passage in Leviticus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In pre-exilic times the law seems to have been, at any rate to a large extent, disregarded (see ch.<a href="/leviticus/26-35.htm" title="As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelled on it.">Leviticus 26:35</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm" title="The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.">Leviticus 26:43</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is true that the custom of letting land lie fallow prevails in so many countries and can be traced back so far that it is certain that the Hebrews must have observed something of the kind from the time of their being settled. If the fallow time were different for different fields there would be nothing to call for special note, and it is not surprising that no reference is found to the practice in the historical Books. But a fixed fallow year for all the land would cause an interruption of social life of which some traces would be found in the history.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Later on, in Nehemiah’s time (<a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm" title="And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.">Nehemiah 10:31</a>), the people bound themselves to carry out the Law. According to Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> xi. 8. 6) both Jews and Samaritans observed it in the time of Alexander the Great, and so later in the days of the Hasmonean dynasty (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-49.htm" title="But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for they came out of the city, because they had no victuals there to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land.">1Ma 6:49</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-53.htm" title="Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;)">1Ma 6:53</a>; <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xiii. 8. 1) and the Herods (<span class="ital">ib.</span> xiv. 16. 2). Tacitus (<span class="ital">Hist.</span> <a href="/leviticus/25-4.htm" title="But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard.">Leviticus 25:4</a>), however, attributes the Jews’ observance of it to laziness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sabbatical year concluded with the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,">Deuteronomy 31:10</a>), and the old reckoning, by which the year began in autumn, not in spring (see on <a href="/context/leviticus/23-23.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 23:23-25</a>), was necessarily applied in this case. The year’s circle of agricultural operations naturally would begin as soon as harvest and vine-gathering were finished.

The words mean only, "in the Sinai district;" and they are employed because these laws form the conclusion of the series of laws given while the people were en-camped under Mount Sinai.
