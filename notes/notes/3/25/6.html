Hence, during the second Temple the produce of the sabbatical year could only be used for direct consumption, and was not allowed to be converted first into other articles and then used. Thus, for instance, though wood of that year could be used as firewood, yet it was illegal to convert it first into coal and then use the coal thus obtained from the wood, nor was it legal to convert vegetables into medicines, or to give human food to animals.<p><span class= "bld">For thee, and for thy servant . . . —</span>The produce is to be left in the field for the free use of the poor, the servant, &c.

Hence it was enacted during the second Temple that “whoso locks up his vineyard, or hedges in his field, or gathers all the fruit into his house in the sabbatical year breaks this law.” Everything is to be left common, and every man has a right to every thing in every place. Every man could only bring into his house a little at a time according to the manner of things that are in common.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/25-6.htm" title="And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for you, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that sojournes with you.">Leviticus 25:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">The sabbath of the land — </span>That is, the accidental crop that grew in the sabbatical year. <span class="ital">Shall be meat for you — </span>For all promiscuously, to take food from thence as you need.

These statues tell us to beware of covetousness, for a man's life consists not in the abundance of his possessions. We are to exercise willing dependence on God's providence for our support; to consider ourselves the Lord's tenants or stewards, and to use our possessions accordingly. This year of rest typified the spiritual rest which all believers enter into through Christ. Through Him we are eased of the burden of wordly care and labour, both being sanctified and sweetened to us; and we are enabled and encouraged to live by faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sabbath of the land shall be meat for you - That is, the produce of the untilled land (its "increase," <a href="/leviticus/25-7.htm">Leviticus 25:7</a>) shall be food for the whole of you in common, rich and poor without distinction <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. When ye come into the land which I give you&#8212;It has been questioned on what year, after the occupation of Canaan, the sabbatic year began to be observed. Some think it was the seventh year after their entrance. But others, considering that as the first six years were spent in the conquest and division of the land (Jos 5:12), and that the sabbatical year was to be observed after six years of agriculture, maintain that the observance did not commence till the fourteenth year.<p>the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord&#8212;This was a very peculiar arrangement. Not only all agricultural processes were to be intermitted every seventh year, but the cultivators had no right to the soil. It lay entirely fallow, and its spontaneous produce was the common property of the poor and the stranger, the cattle and game. This year of rest was to invigorate the productive powers of the land, as the weekly Sabbath was a refreshment to men and cattle. It commenced immediately after the feast of ingathering, and it was calculated to teach the people, in a remarkable manner, the reality of the presence and providential power of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sabbath, </span> i.e. the growth of the sabbath, or that fruit which groweth in the sabbatical year.
