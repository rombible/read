This sound was to be made on the evening of the great day of atonement; for the proclamation of gospel liberty and salvation results from the sacrifice of the Redeemer. It was provided that the lands should not be sold away from their families. They could only be disposed of, as it were, by leases till the year of jubilee, and then returned to the owner or his heir. This tended to preserve their tribes and families distinct, till the coming of the Messiah. The liberty every man was born to, if sold or forfeited, should return at the year of jubilee. This was typical of redemption by Christ from the slavery of sin and Satan, and of being brought again to the liberty of the children of God. All bargains ought to be made by this rule, Ye shall not oppress one another, not take advantage of one another's ignorance or necessity, but thou shalt fear thy God. The fear of God reigning in the heart, would restrain from doing wrong to our neighbour in word or deed. Assurance was given that they should be great gainers, by observing these years of rest. If we are careful to do our duty, we may trust God with our comfort. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all neither sowed or reaped. This was a miracle for an encouragement to all God's people, in all ages, to trust him in the way of duty. There is nothing lost by faith and self-denial in obedience. Some asked, What shall we eat the seventh year? Thus many Christians anticipate evils, questioning what they shall do, and fearing to proceed in the way of duty. But we have no right to anticipate evils, so as to distress ourselves about them. To carnal minds we may appear to act absurdly, but the path of duty is ever the path of safety.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In safety - i. e., secure from famine, <a href="/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

On the other hand, <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/25-20.htm" title="And if you shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:">Leviticus 25:20</a></span> has ‘the seventh year’ (not the seventh and eighth), and <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/25-22.htm" title="And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in you shall eat of the old store.">Leviticus 25:22</a></span> ‘ye shall sow the eighth year’ (not the ninth).

The question, <span class="cmt_word">What shall we eat?</span> would present itself with double force when the sabbatical and the jubilee years came together. It and the answer to it therefore properly follow on the institution of the jubilee, instead of preceding it, as Ewald, Knobcl, and others demand that it should do. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The other effect of the fiftieth year proclaimed with the trumpet-blast consisted in the fact that the Israelites were not to sow or reap, just as in the sabbatical year (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-4.htm">Leviticus 25:4</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>).
