Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He was not treated as an outcast, but enjoyed his privileges as a son of Aaron, except in regard to active duties.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-24.

Priests laboring under any personal defect were not allowed to officiate in the public service; they might be employed in some inferior duties about the sanctuary but could not perform any sacred office. In all these regulations for preserving the unsullied purity of the sacred character and office, there was a typical reference to the priesthood of Christ (Heb 7:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Or a man that is brokenfooted or brokenhanded.
