According to the administrators of the Law during the second Temple, the phrase, “his kin that is near unto him,” or rather, “his flesh that is near unto him” (comp. <a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm" title="None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:6</a> with <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>), denotes “wife.” Hence the Chaldee version of Jonathan renders it, “but for a wife who is of kin to his flesh.”<p><span class= "bld">For his mother, and for his father.—</span>This is the second of the three instances in the Bible where the mother is mentioned before the father (see <a href="/leviticus/19-3.htm" title="You shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:3</a>). The Jewish canonists, who call attention to this unusual phrase, account for it by saying that she is placed first because the son’s qualifications for the priesthood depend more upon his having a good mother (see <a href="/leviticus/21-7.htm" title="They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.">Leviticus 21:7</a>). This will be readily understood when it is borne in mind that the regulations about the woman whom a priest was allowed to marry during the second Temple were of the most stringent nature, and that the slightest infringement of them disqualified the son for performing sacerdotal functions. Thus the daughter of a foreigner or of a released captive was forbidden to the priest, and when a city was besieged and taken by the enemy all the wives of the priests had to be divorced for fear lest they had suffered violence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/21-2.htm" title="But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.">Leviticus 21:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Near to him </span>— Under which general expression his wife seems to be comprehended, though she be not expressed.

Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory.

There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people&#8212;The obvious design of the regulations contained in this chapter was to keep inviolate the purity and dignity of the sacred office. Contact with a corpse, or even contiguity to the place where it lay, entailing ceremonial defilement (Nu 19:14), all mourners were debarred from the tabernacle for a week; and as the exclusion of a priest during that period would have been attended with great inconvenience, the whole order were enjoined to abstain from all approaches to the dead, except at the funerals of relatives, to whom affection or necessity might call them to perform the last offices.

For such he might be defiled and mourn, or be where they were, and take care of, and attend their funerals: this clause some take to be general, of which the particulars follow, as Aben Ezra; but others take it to be the first particular excepted, and instanced in, and intends his wife; for it may be rendered, as by some, "for his flesh", or "the rest of him" (p), the other part of himself, his wife, which is his other self, and one flesh with him; and so Jarchi and others observe, there is no flesh of his, but his wife; and if she is not intended here, she is not expressed elsewhere, though must be supposed, because it is allowed the priest to defile himself for other relations not so near; and it is plain from the case of Ezekiel, that a priest might mourn for his wife, <a href="/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15</a>; he being forbid it, shows his case to be an extraordinary one, and that ordinarily it was admitted, otherwise there would have been no need of a particular prohibition of him: <p>that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and his brother; R.

For this reason (<a href="/leviticus/18-25.htm">Leviticus 18:25</a>) they were also to sever (make distinctions) between clean and unclean cattle and birds, and not make their souls (i.e., their persons) abominable through unclean animals, with which the earth swarmed, and which God had "separated to make unclean," i.e., had prohibited them from eating or touching when dead, because they defiled (see ch. 11). For (<a href="/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>) they were to be holy, because Jehovah their God was holy, who had severed them from the nations, to belong to Him, i.e., to be the nation of His possession (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a>). </body></html>
