According to the administrators of the Law during the second Temple, the expression <span class= "ital">any dead body </span>extends to any portion of it, so that when the pontiff entered a place where a certain quantity of the blood of the dead body was to be found, he became defiled. Accordingly, “any dead soul,” which is literally the meaning of the phrase here translated by “dead body,” denotes the blood which constitutes the soul or life. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/17-10.htm" title="And whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eats any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Nor defile himself for his father . . . —</span>Better, <span class= "ital">not for his father </span>. . . <span class= "ital">shall he defile himself </span>or, <span class= "ital">not even for his father, </span>&c. As the rigorous enactment in the preceding clause constitutes already the difference between the high priest and the ordinary priest, this clause simply adduces an instance to illustrate it. Whilst the ordinary priest was not only permitted, but even obliged, to attend the funeral ceremonies of no less than seven of his relations (see <a href="/context/leviticus/21-2.htm" title="But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.">Leviticus 21:2-3</a>), the high priest was not even allowed to join in the obsequies of his parents. The only exception made in his case was when he found a human body in an isolated place. Under such circumstances he was not only permitted, but it was a meritorious act on his part, to bury it. (See <a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:">Leviticus 21:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm" title="Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;">Leviticus 21:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Go in </span>— Into the chamber or house where they lie.

Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body.

Moreover, the high dignity of his office demanded a corresponding superiority in personal holiness, and stringent rules were prescribed for the purpose of upholding the suitable dignity of his station and family. The same rules are extended to the families of Christian ministers (1Ti 3:2; Tit 1:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Neither shall he go, </span> to wit, into the chamber or house where they lie.

That is, into a tent or house where any dead body lies, as Jarchi and Aben Ezra interpret it, for whoever went into such a place was unclean seven days; and so long therefore an high priest, should he enter there, would be prevented doing the duty of his office, see <a href="/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14</a>; this was aped and followed by the Heathens in later times; so among the Romans, the "Flamen Dialis", or high priest of Jupiter, might not go into a place where a dead body was burnt or buried, nor touch any (h); and it was a custom with them, as Servius (i) tells us, to put a branch of cypress at the door of a house where a dead body was, that an high priest might not enter through ignorance, and be defiled: <p>nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; by entering into the tent or house where they lay dead, or by touching them, or attending the funeral of them, or by concerning himself about it; and there was no need to mention his son or his daughter, his brother or his sister; for if he was not to defile himself for any of his parents, much less for any of those which are excepted in the case of a common priest, <a href="/leviticus/21-2.htm">Leviticus 21:2</a>; the Jews do indeed make one exception in the case of an high priest, and that is, that if he meets with a dead body in the way, he was obliged to defile himself for it and bury it (k); and so among the Romans, though it was a crime for an high priest to look upon a dead body, yet it was reckoned a greater, if, when he saw it, he left it unburied (l). <p>(h) Massurius Sabinus, apud A.

As every corpse not only defiled the persons who touched it, but also the tent or dwelling in which the person had died (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a>, <a href="/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14</a>); in the case of death among members of the family or household, defilement was not to be avoided on the part of the priest as the head of the family. It was therefore allowable for him to defile himself on account of such persons as these, and even to take part in their burial. The words of <a href="/leviticus/21-4.htm">Leviticus 21:4</a> are obscure: "He shall not defile himself &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, i.e., as lord (pater-familias) among his countrymen, to desecrate himself;" and the early translators have wandered in uncertainty among different renderings. In all probability &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; denotes the master of the house or husband. But, for all that, the explanation given by Knobel and others, "as a husband he shall not defile himself on the death of his wife, his mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, by taking part in their burial," is decidedly to be rejected. For, apart from the unwarrantable introduction of the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, there is sufficient to prevent our thinking of defilement on the death of a wife, in the fact that the wife is included in the "kin that is near unto him" in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-2.htm">Leviticus 21:2</a>, though not in the way that many Rabbins suppose, who maintain that &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; signifies wife, but implicite, the wife not being expressly mentioned, because man and wife form one flesh (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), and the wife stands nearer to the husband than father and mother, son and daughter, or brother and sister. Nothing is proved by appealing to the statement made by Plutarch, that the priests of the Romans were not allowed to defile themselves by touching the corpses of their wives; inasmuch as there is no trace of this custom to be found among the Israelites, and the Rabbins, for this very reason, suppose the death of an illegitimate wife to be intended. The correct interpretation of the words can only be arrived at by considering the relation of the fourth verse to what precedes and follows. As <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a> stand in a very close relation to <a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, - the defilement on account of a dead person being more particularly explained in the latter, or rather, strictly speaking, greater force being given to the prohibition, - it is natural to regard <a href="/leviticus/21-4.htm">Leviticus 21:4</a> as standing in a similar relation to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-7.htm">Leviticus 21:7</a>, and to understand it as a general prohibition, which is still more clearly expounded in <a href="/leviticus/21-7.htm">Leviticus 21:7</a> and <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>. The priest was not to defile himself as a husband and the head of a household, either by marrying a wife of immoral or ambiguous reputation, or by training his children carelessly, so as to desecrate himself, i.e., profane the holiness of his rank and office by either one or the other (cf. <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a> and <a href="/leviticus/21-15.htm">Leviticus 21:15</a>). - In <a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a> desecration is forbidden in the event of a death occurring. He was not to shave a bald place upon his head. According to the Chethib &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1492; is to be pointed with  &#1492;- attached, and the Keri &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is a grammatical alteration to suit the plural suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which is obviously to be rejected on account of the parallel &#1497;&#1490;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1488;&#1514;. In both of the clauses there is a constructio ad sensum, the prohibition which is addressed to individuals being applicable to the whole: upon their head shall no one shave a bald place, namely, in front above the forehead, "between the eyes" (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>). We may infer from the context that reference is made to a customary mode of mourning for the dead; and this is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, where it is forbidden to all the Israelites "for the dead." According to Herodotus, 2, 36, the priests in Egypt were shaven, whereas in other places they wore their hair long. In other nations it was customary for those who were more immediately concerned to shave their heads as a sign of mourning; but the Egyptians let their hair grow both upon their head and chin when any of their relations were dead, whereas they shaved at other times. The two other outward signs of mourning mentioned, namely, cutting off the edge of the beard and making incisions in the body, have already been forbidden in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27-28</a>, and the latter is repeated in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>. The reason for the prohibition is given in <a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a> - "they shall be holy unto their God," and therefore not disfigure their head and body by signs of passionate grief, and so profane the name of their God when they offer the firings of Jehovah; that is to say, when they serve and approach the God who has manifested Himself to His people as the Holy One. On the epithet applied to the sacrifices, "the food of God," see at <a href="/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a> and <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>. </body></html>
