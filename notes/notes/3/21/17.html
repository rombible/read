Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body.

Priests laboring under any personal defect were not allowed to officiate in the public service; they might be employed in some inferior duties about the sanctuary but could not perform any sacred office. In all these regulations for preserving the unsullied purity of the sacred character and office, there was a typical reference to the priesthood of Christ (Heb 7:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whosoever he be of thy seed, </span> whether the high priest or the inferior ones. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In their generations; </span> in all successive ages, as long as your priesthood and policy endures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Any blemish, </span> i.e. any defect or excess of parts, any notorious deformity, or imperfection in his body.

We are not to understand by this, however, that the sanctuary was to be his constant abode, as Bhr and Baumgarten maintain (cf. <a href="/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>). "Neither shall he profane the sanctuary of his God," sc., by any defilement of his person which he could and ought to avoid; "for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him" (cf. <a href="/leviticus/10-7.htm">Leviticus 10:7</a>), and defilement was incompatible with this. &#1504;&#1494;&#1512; does not mean the diadem of the high priest here, as in <a href="/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>, but consecration (see at <a href="/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a>). </body></html>
