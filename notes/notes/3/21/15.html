Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Profane his seed - i. e. by a marriage which was not in keeping with the holiness of his office. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-15. he that is the high priest among his brethren &#8230; shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes&#8212;The indulgence in the excepted cases of family bereavement, mentioned above [Le 21:2, 3], which was granted to the common priests, was denied to him; for his absence from the sanctuary for the removal of any contracted defilement could not have been dispensed with, neither could he have acted as intercessor for the people, unless ceremonially clean. Moreover, the high dignity of his office demanded a corresponding superiority in personal holiness, and stringent rules were prescribed for the purpose of upholding the suitable dignity of his station and family. The same rules are extended to the families of Christian ministers (1Ti 3:2; Tit 1:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Neither shall he profane his seed</span> by mixing it with forbidden kinds, whereby the children would be disparaged, and rendered unfit for their priestly function. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Do sanctify him, </span> i.e. have separated him from all other sorts of men for my especial and immediate service, and therefore will not have that race corrupted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither shall he profane his seed among his people,....
