The sacerdotal laws were administered and enforced by the elders or Sanhedrim, who were the representatives of the people. (See <a href="/leviticus/21-21.htm" title="No man that has a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come near to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.">Leviticus 21:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body.

Priests laboring under any personal defect were not allowed to officiate in the public service; they might be employed in some inferior duties about the sanctuary but could not perform any sacred office. In all these regulations for preserving the unsullied purity of the sacred character and office, there was a typical reference to the priesthood of Christ (Heb 7:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses told it to Aaron, and to his sons,....

As the spiritual nature of a man is reflected in his bodily form, only a faultless condition of body could correspond to the holiness of the priest; just as the Greeks and Romans required, for the very same reason, that the priests should be &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, integri corporis (Plato de legg. 6, 759; Seneca excerpt. controv. 4, 2; Plutarch quaest. <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/73.htm">Romans 73</a>). Consequently none of the descendants of Aaron, "according to their generations," i.e., in all future generations (see <a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>), who had any blemish (mum, &#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, bodily fault) were to approach the vail, i.e., enter the holy place, or draw near to the altar (in the court) to offer the food of Jehovah, viz., the sacrifices.
