Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body.

Moreover, the high dignity of his office demanded a corresponding superiority in personal holiness, and stringent rules were prescribed for the purpose of upholding the suitable dignity of his station and family.

The high priest might not marry, whether the widow of a priest or of an Israelite, as Aben Ezra, that is, of any Israelite that was not of the priesthood; and this, whether a widow after espousals, or after marriage, as runs the Jewish canon (u); the meaning is, that if she was betrothed to a man, and that man died before he married her, and so was a virgin; yet being betrothed to him was reckoned as his widow; and such an one the high priest might not marry, any more than one that had been left a widow, having being married: though, according to the same constitutions, if he had betrothed a widow, and after that was appointed an high priest, he might marry her, and an instance of it is given in Joshua the son of Gamla: and in the same it is observed, that an high priest, when his brother dies, must suffer his shoe to be plucked off, and not marry his brother's widow; which, in other cases, when there was no issue, was required: <p>or a divorced woman; whether by a priest, or a common Israelite; and indeed, if a common priest might not marry such a person, much less an high priest: or profane anyone born of those that were not fit for priests to marry, as the Targum of Jonathan and Jarchi; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-7.htm">Leviticus 21:7</a>, <p>or an harlot; a common prostitute: <p>those shall he not take any or either of them, to be his wife; which are forbid in order to maintain the dignity of his office, and a reverence of it: there seems to be a gradation in these instances, he might not marry a widow, which was forbidden no other man; and if not such an one, much less a divorced woman, still less a profane person, and least of all an harlot: <p>but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife; which phrase, "of his own people", did not limit him to his own tribe, and to the fraternity of priests in it, as if he was to marry only in it, or the daughter of a priest; for the priests and Levites being scattered in the several tribes, and having no inheritances in them, were not restrained from marrying into other tribes, as the rest of the tribes were; and so an high priest sometimes married into another tribe, though he took care not to debase himself, by marrying into a mean family: so Jehoiada, the high priest, married Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, <a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>; but by this law he was forbid to marry a virgin of another nation, even though a proselytess and one that was made free, as Gersom observes; a captive virgin, and one that was become a Jewess, as Aben Ezra says, he was not allowed to marry. <p>(u) Misn.

The Jewish writer Rashi, in his commentary on the Talmudic treatise <span class="ital">Chagigah</span> (13<span class="ital">a</span>, Tal. Bab.), mentions this as one of the instances of apparent discrepancies between Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/44-22.htm" title="Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.">Ezekiel 44:22</a>) and the Law (see Ryle, <span class="ital">Canon</span>, 203). Ezekiel (<span class="ital">loc. cit</span>.) allowed a priest, to marry a widow, provided she was the widow of a priest, whereas, according to the Law here, a high priest might not marry a widow. Ezekiel’s rule is, however, for <span class="ital">priests</span>. He does not say anything about the high priest. According to the law here, he must marry a virgin. As regards the rule for the ordinary priest, while <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/21-7.htm" title="They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.">Leviticus 21:7</a></span> does not <span class="ital">say</span> that he may marry a priest’s widow, <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/21-14.htm" title="A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.">Leviticus 21:14</a></span> may perhaps be taken to imply this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of his own people</span>] of the people of Israel, according to Ezekiel (<span class="ital">loc. cit</span>.), but the traditional practice was to marry a priest’s daughter, cp. <a href="/luke/1-5.htm" title="THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.">Luke 1:5</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thou shalt sanctify him therefore," that is to say, not merely "respect his holy dignity" (Knobel), but take care that he did not desecrate his office by a marriage so polluted. The Israelites as a nation are addressed in the persons of their chiefs. The second clause of the verse, "he shall be holy unto thee," contains the same thought. The repetition strengthens the exhortation. The reason assigned for the first clause is the same as in <a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>; and that for the second, the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-8.htm">Leviticus 20:8</a>, <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>, etc.</body></html>
