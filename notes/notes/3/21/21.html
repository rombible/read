Hence, during the second Temple, the authorities registered no less than one hundred and forty-two defects which disqualify the priest for serving at the altar. There was a chamber in the court of the Temple in which the Sanhedrim examined all the priests prior to their being received into the staff of those who officiated in the sanctuary. At the conclusion of this periodical examination, all the priests were divided into two classes. Those who were pronounced physically disqualified “put on black garments, wrapped themselves up in black cloaks, and went away in silence”; whilst those who were declared qualified put on white garments and white cloaks, and forthwith joined their brethren to assist in the sacred office. They celebrated the day by giving a feast to all their friends, which they opened with the following benediction: “Blessed be the Lord! Blessed be He because no blemish hath been found in the seed of Aaron, the priest; and blessed be He because He hath chosen Aaron and his sons to stand and to serve before the Lord in His most holy sanctuary.” Those priests who were declared physically unfit, were employed in the chamber for wood at the north-east of the court of the women, to select the proper wood for the altar, since any piece which was worm-eaten could not be burnt on it. (See <a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm" title="And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire:">Leviticus 1:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/21-21.htm" title="No man that has a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come near to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.">Leviticus 21:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">A blemish — </span>Any notorious blemish whereby he is disfigured, though not here mentioned.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-24 Laws concerning the priests. - As these priests were types of Christ, so all ministers must be followers of him, that their example may teach others to imitate the Saviour. Without blemish, and separate from sinners, He executed his priestly office on earth. What manner of persons then should his ministers be! But all are, if Christians, spiritual priests; the minister especially is called to set a good example, that the people may follow it. Our bodily infirmities, blessed be God, cannot now shut us out from his service, from these privileges, or from his heavenly glory. Many a healthful, beautiful soul is lodged in a feeble, deformed body. And those who may not be suited for the work of the ministry, may serve God with comfort in other duties in his church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A dwarf - One who is small and wasted, either short, as in the text, or slender, as in the margin.

Priests laboring under any personal defect were not allowed to officiate in the public service; they might be employed in some inferior duties about the sanctuary but could not perform any sacred office. In all these regulations for preserving the unsullied purity of the sacred character and office, there was a typical reference to the priesthood of Christ (Heb 7:26).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">No man that hath a blemish; </span> any notorious blemish whereby he is disfigured, though not here mentioned. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>No man that hath a blemish, of the seed of Aaron the priest,....
