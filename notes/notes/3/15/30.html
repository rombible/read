These laws remind us that God sees all things, even those which escape the notice of men.

The design of these several laws concerning uncleanness by issues, was to set forth the filthiness of sin arising from the corruption of human nature; particularly the pollution of fleshly lusts, and the necessity of purification from them by the grace of God, and blood of Christ, and of holiness of heart and life, in order to a near approach to God, particularly in public worship, as the next words suggest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If a man lay with her and her uncleanness came upon him, he became unclean for seven days, and the bed upon which he lay became unclean as well. The meaning cannot be merely if he lie upon the same bed with her, but if he have conjugal intercourse, as is evident from <a href="/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a> and <a href="/numbers/5-13.htm">Numbers 5:13</a> (cf. <a href="/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>).

For the law in <a href="/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a> refers partly to conjugal intercourse during the hemorrhage of a woman after child-birth, as the similarity of the words in <a href="/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a> and <a href="/leviticus/12-7.htm">Leviticus 12:7</a> (&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;) clearly proves, and to the case of a man attempting cohabitation with a woman during her menstruation. The verse before us, on the contrary, refers simply to the possibility of menstruation commencing during the act of conjugal intercourse, when the man would be involuntarily defiled through the unexpected uncleanness of the woman. </body></html>
