and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.">1Kings 5:6</a> in Hebrew, or <a href="/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a> in English, where it is rendered “chariot” in the Authorised Version, and in <a href="/songs/3-10.htm" title="He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the middle thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.">Song of Solomon 3:10</a>, where it is translated “covering” but where it manifestly denotes the seat inside the palanquin. With the feminine termination the word in question occurs no less than forty-four times, and is invariably translated in the Authorised Version “chariot.” What kind of vehicle the masculine form of the expression in question denotes in the three passages in which it occurs must be decided from the context. In Kings, the horses which are used in connection with it show that it was a carriage drawn by animals. In Canticles it is a vehicle, or the essential part of it, carried by men, and this is the kind of vehicle meant in the passage before us. It is the well-known palanquin so largely used in the East.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be unclean.</span>—The conveyance used is to be unclean, and hence, is not to be used by any one else. It will be seen that the present text does not say how long the vehicle is to be defiled, though in every other instance the time is fixed. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/15-5.htm" title="And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:5-11</a>.) There can, therefore, hardly be any doubt that the reading in the LXX., which has here <span class= "ital">until evening, </span>is the original one, and that the words have dropped out of the Hebrew text.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-33 Laws concerning ceremonial uncleanness. - We need not be curious in explaining these laws; but have reason to be thankful that we need fear no defilement, except that of sin, nor need ceremonial and burdensome purifications. These laws remind us that God sees all things, even those which escape the notice of men. The great gospel duties of faith and repentance are here signified, and the great gospel privileges of the application of Christ's blood to our souls for our justification, and his grace for our sanctification.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This chapter would seem to take its place more naturally before <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/12-1.htm">Leviticus 12:1-8</a>, with the subject of which it is inmediately connected.

That even here the term flesh is not a euphemism for the organ of generation, as is frequently assumed, is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13</a>, "he shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water," when compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23-24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-28.htm">Leviticus 16:28</a>, etc., where flesh cannot possibly have any such meaning. The "flesh" is the body as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-7.htm">Leviticus 15:7</a>, "whoever touches the flesh of him that hath the issue," as compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>, "whosoever toucheth her." At the same time, the agreement between the law relating to the man with an issue and that concerning the woman with an issue (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>, "her issue in her flesh") points unmistakeably to a secretion from the sexual organs. Only the seat of the disease is not more closely defined. The issue of the man is not a hemorrhoidal disease, for nothing is said about a flow of blood; still less is it a syphilitic suppuration (gonorrhaea virulenta), for the occurrence of this at all in antiquity is very questionable; but it is either a diseased flow of semen (gonorrhaea), i.e., an involuntary flow drop by drop arising from weakness of the organ, as Jerome and the Rabbins assume, or more probably, simply blenorrhaea urethrae, a discharge of mucus arising from a catarrhal affection of the mucous membrane of the urethra (urethritis). The participle &#1494;&#1489; &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is expressive of continued duration. In <a href="/leviticus/15-3.htm">Leviticus 15:3</a> the uncleanness is still more closely defined: "whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh closes before his issue," i.e., whether the member lets the matter flow out or by closing retains it, "it is his uncleanness," i.e., in the latter case as well as the former it is uncleanness to him, he is unclean. For the "closing" is only a temporary obstruction, brought about by some particular circumstance. </body></html>
