This is a remarkable instance of Moses’ humility, and of the human side of his nature as a lawgiver. (See also <a href="/numbers/32-6.htm" title="And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?">Numbers 32:6</a>, &c.) Hence Jewish tradition from time immemorial ascribes the mistake to Moses, and not to Aaron. The paraphrase of this verse in the Palestine Chaldee Version, which embodies the ancient opinions, is very instructive. It is as follows: “And when Moses heard it, he approved of this explanation. Whereupon he sent a herald through the whole camp of Israel, saying, It is I from whom the law had been hid, and my brother Aaron brought it to my remembrance.”<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/10-20.htm" title="And when Moses heard that, he was content.">Leviticus 10:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moses was content — </span>He rested satisfied with Aaron’s answer, who, it appeared, had sincerely aimed at pleasing God; and those who do so, will find he is not <span class="ital">extreme to mark what is amiss.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:12-20 Afflictions should rather quicken us to our duty, than take us from it. But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That is: "Behold this very day, in which we have done our part in sacrificing sin-offerings and burnt-offerings to the Lord, this great calamity has befallen me. Could it have been well-pleasing to the Lord if those who have been so humbled as I and my sons have been by the sin of our relations and the divine judgment, had feasted on the most holy flesh of the sin-offering?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-20. Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt&#8212;In a sacrifice presented, as that had been, on behalf of the people, it was the duty of the priests, as typically representing them and bearing their sins, to have eaten the flesh after the blood had been sprinkled upon the altar. Instead of using it, however, for a sacred feast, they had burnt it without the camp; and Moses, who discovered this departure from the prescribed ritual, probably from a dread of some further chastisements, challenged, not Aaron, whose heart was too much lacerated to bear a new cause of distress but his two surviving sons in the priesthood for the great irregularity. Their father, however, who heard the charge and by whose directions the error had been committed, hastened to give the explanation. The import of his apology is, that all the duty pertaining to the presentation of the offering had been duly and sacredly performed, except the festive part of the observance, which privately devolved upon the priest and his family. And that this had been omitted, either because his heart was too dejected to join in the celebration of a cheerful feast, or that he supposed, from the appalling judgments that had been inflicted, that all the services of that occasion were so vitiated that he did not complete them. Aaron was decidedly in the wrong. By the express command of God, the sin offering was to be eaten in the holy place; and no fanciful view of expediency or propriety ought to have led him to dispense at discretion with a positive statute. The law of God was clear and, where that is the case, it is sin to deviate a hair's breadth from the path of duty. But Moses sympathized with his deeply afflicted brother and, having pointed out the error, said no more.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He rested satisfied with his answer, either because he thought it reasonable, seeing the letter of the law ofttimes yields to necessities or great accidents, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/30-18.htm" title="For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.

He said no more, he did not proceed in blaming him and his sons, but was satisfied with the answer returned; he considered the grief and trouble of mind that attended Aaron, which might not only cause him to disregard food, but even to forget what was commanded to be done in this case; and besides he might observe, that there was some difficulty attending it; in some cases the flesh of the sin offering was to be eaten, and not burnt; in others, to be burnt, and not eaten; and this being the first time of offering one, the mistake might be the more easily made; and fearing one might be made, and especially when Aaron was in such circumstances, might be the reason Moses so diligently sought after the goat of the sin offering: moreover, what Aaron had done appeared to be not out of any wilful neglect of the command of God, but with a good design, as judging it would be unacceptable to him, should he have eaten of it in his circumstances. Moses upon the whole thought him excusable, at least insisted no more upon the blame. The Jewish writers make the mistake to lie on the side of Moses and not Aaron; and which the former acknowledged, according to the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem: see <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when Moses heard <i>that</i>, he was <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> content.</span><p>(h) Moses bore with his infirmity, considering his great sorrow, but does not leave an example to forgive them that maliciously transgress the commandment of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the directions occasioned by this judgment of God, Moses reminded Aaron and his sons of the general laws concerning the consumption of the priests' portions of the sacrifices, and their relation to the existing circumstances: first of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a>, <a href="/leviticus/10-13.htm">Leviticus 10:13</a>), of the law relating to the eating of the meat-offering, which belonged to the priests after the azcarah had been lifted off (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9-11</a>), and then (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm">Leviticus 10:14</a>, <a href="/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>) of that relating to the wave-breast and heave-leg (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32-34</a>). By the minchah in <a href="/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a> we are to understand the meal and oil, which were offered with the burnt-offering of the nation (<a href="/leviticus/9-4.htm">Leviticus 9:4</a> and <a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>); and by the &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>, those portions of the burnt-offering, meat-offering, and peace-offering of the nation which were burned upon the altar (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm">Leviticus 9:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/9-20.htm">Leviticus 9:20</a>). He then looked for "the he-goat of the sin-offering," - i.e., the flesh of the goat which had been brought for a sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), and which was to have been eaten by the priests in the holy place along with the sin-offerings, whose blood was not taken into the sanctuary (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>); - "and, behold, it was burned" (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;,   3 perf. Pual). Moses was angry at this, and reproved Eleazar and Ithamar, who had attended to the burning: "Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in a holy place?" he said; "for it is most holy, and He (Jehovah) hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for it before Jehovah," as its blood had not been brought into the holy place (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; construed as a passive with an accusative, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>, etc.). "To bear the iniquity" does not signify here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, to bear and atone for the sin in its consequences, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, to take the sin of another upon one's self, for the purpose of cancelling it, to make expiation for it. As, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, the high priest was to appear before the Lord with the diadem upon his forehead, as the symbol of the holiness of his office, to cancel, as the mediator of the nation and by virtue of his official holiness, the sin which adhered to the holy gifts of the nation (see the note on this passage), so here it is stated with regard to the official eating of the most holy flesh of the sin-offering, which had been enjoined upon the priests, that they were thereby to bear the sin of the congregation, to make atonement for it. This effect or signification could only be ascribed to the eating, by its being regarded as an incorporation of the victim laden with sin, whereby the priests actually took away the sin by virtue of the holiness and sanctifying power belonging to their office, and not merely declared it removed, as Oehler explains the words (Herzog's Cycl. x. p. 649). <a href="/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> is decisive in opposition to the declaratory view, which does not embrace the meaning of the words, and is not applicable to the passage at all. "Incorporabant quasi peccatum populique reatum in se recipiebant" (Deyling observv. ss. i. 45, 2).<p>(Note: C. a Lapide has given this correct interpretation of the passage: "ut scilicet cum hostiis populi pro peccato simul etiam populi peccata in vos quasi recipiatis, ut illa expietis." There is no foundation for the objection offered by Oehler, that the actual removal of guilt and the atonement itself were effected by the offering of the blood. For it by no means follows from <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, that the blood, as the soul of the sacrificial animal, covered or expiated the soul of the sinner, and that the removal and extinction of the sin had already taken place with the covering of the soul before the holy God, which involved the forgiveness of the sin and the reception of the sinner to mercy.) </body></html>
