(See <a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm" title="And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-23.htm" title="Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 38:23</a>.)

When God corrects us or ours for sin, it is our duty to accept the punishment, and say, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good. Whenever we worship God, we come nigh unto him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious in all acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to do every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God with whom we have to do, is a holy God.

Upon this awful occasion, and in order to quiet and humble him under the mighty hand of God: <p>this is it that the Lord spoke, saying; but when he spoke it, and where it is said and recorded, is not so very clear; it might have been said, and yet not recorded, or the substance of it may be recorded, though not in the express words here delivered; it may refer, as some think, to <a href="/exodus/19-22.htm">Exodus 19:22</a> or else to <a href="/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43</a> which seems to come nearest to what follows, so Jarchi: <p>I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me; in the priests that drew nigh to him, and offered sacrifice and burnt incense to him; by these he expected to be sanctified, not to be made holy, but to be declared to be so, and obeyed and worshipped as such; as he is, when his commands and ordinances are observed, as he would have them be, in faith and fear, which were not done by these sons of Aaron; and therefore the Lord, by the punishment he inflicted, showed himself to be an holy, righteous, and jealous God: <p>and before all the people I will be glorified; as he is when he is believed and trusted in; when his worship is carried on in his own house, according to his will; when his ordinances are kept as they were delivered, and when he is reverenced in the assembly of his saints; all which were wanting in this case. And this may also have respect to the glory of divine justice, in the public punishment of the sin of those men, that since he was not glorified by them before the people in the way of their duty, he would glorify himself in their punishment: <p>and Aaron held his peace: was in a stupor, as the Septuagint, quite amazed, thunderstruck, as we say; he was silent, said not one word against what was done; murmured not at the providence, nor complained of any severity, but was patient under the hand of God, and resigned to his will; and since God was sanctified and glorified, he was contented. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Moses said unto Aaron, This <i>is it</i> that the LORD spake, saying, I will be <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.

The blood of this sin-offering, which was presented for the congregation, was not brought into the holy place according to the rule laid down in <a href="/leviticus/7-16.htm">Leviticus 7:16</a>., but only applied to the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; for the same reason as in the previous case (<a href="/leviticus/9-8.htm">Leviticus 9:8</a>.), viz., because the object was not to expiate any particular sin, or the sins of the congregation that had been committed in the course of time and remained unatoned for, but simply to place the sacrificial service of the congregation in its proper relation to the Lord. Aaron was reproved by Moses, however, for having burned the flesh (<a href="/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16</a>.), but was able to justify it (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm">Leviticus 10:16-20</a>). The sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>) was also offered "according to the right" (as in <a href="/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>). Then followed the meat-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), of which Aaron burned a handful upon the altar (according to the rule in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a>). He offered this in addition to the morning burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/29-39.htm">Exodus 29:39</a>), to which a meat-offering also belonged (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>), and with which, according to <a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>., the special meat-offering of the priests was associated. Last of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-18.htm">Leviticus 9:18-21</a>) there followed the peace-offering, which was also carried out according to the general rule. In &#1492;&#1502;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, "the covering" (<a href="/leviticus/9-19.htm">Leviticus 9:19</a>), the two fat portions mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3</a> are included. The fat portions were laid upon the breast-pieces by the sons of Aaron, and then handed by them to Aaron, the fat to be burned upon the altar, the breast to be waved along with the right leg, according to the instructions in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-36</a>. The meat-offering of pastry, which belonged to the peace-offering according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-13</a>, is not specially mentioned. </body></html>
