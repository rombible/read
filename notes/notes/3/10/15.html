But our unfitness for duty, when it is natural and not sinful, will have great allowances made for it; God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wave breast and heave shoulder - See <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15.

Shecar was an intoxicating drink made of barley and dates or honey. &#1492;&#1500;, profanus, common, is a wider or more comprehensive notion than &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;, unclean. Everything was common (profane) which was not fitted for the sanctuary, even what was allowable for daily use and enjoyment, and therefore was to be regarded as clean. The motive for laying down on this particular occasion a prohibition which was to hold good for all time, seems to lie in the event recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>, although we can hardly infer from this, as some commentators have done, that Nadab and Abihu offered the unlawful incense-offering in a state of intoxication. The connection between their act and this prohibition consisted simply in the rashness, which had lost the clear and calm reflection that is indispensable to right action. </body></html>
