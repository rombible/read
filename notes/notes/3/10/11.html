Do not drink wine nor strong drink&#8212;This prohibition, and the accompanying admonitions, following immediately the occurrence of so fatal a catastrophe [Le 10:1, 2], has given rise to an opinion entertained by many, that the two disobedient priests were under the influence of intoxication when they committed the offense which was expiated only by their lives.

The expression, "before the sanctuary" (equivalent to "before the tabernacle of the congregation" in <a href="/leviticus/9-5.htm">Leviticus 9:5</a>), shows that they had been slain in front of the entrance to the holy place. They were carried out in their priests' body-coats, since they had also been defiled by the judgment. It follows from this, too, that the fire of Jehovah had not burned them up, but had simply killed them as with a flash of lightning. </body></html>
