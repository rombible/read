When God corrects us or ours for sin, it is our duty to accept the punishment, and say, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good. Whenever we worship God, we come nigh unto him, as spiritual priests. This ought to make us very serious in all acts of devotion. It concerns us all, when we come nigh to God, to do every religious exercise, as those who believe that the God with whom we have to do, is a holy God.

They were to bear visible testimony to the righteousness of the punishment of Nadab and Abihu. The people, on the other hand, as not formally standing so near to Yahweh, were permitted to "bewail" as an acknowledgment that the nation had a share in the sin of its priests.

Ripping the clothes in front so as to lay open the breast was one of the most common manifestations of grief (see <a href="/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11</a>; <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, etc.).

Uncover not your heads&#8212;They who were ordered to carry out the two bodies, being engaged in their sacred duties, were forbidden to remove their turbans, in conformity with the usual customs of mourning; and the prohibition "neither rend your garments," was, in all probability, confined also to their official costume. For at other times the priests wore the ordinary dress of their countrymen and, in common with their families, might indulge their private feelings by the usual signs or expressions of grief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Uncover not your heads; either, </span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

On coming out again they united in bestowing that blessing upon the people which they had solicited for them in the sanctuary. "Then the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people, and fire came out from before the face of Jehovah and consumed the burnt-offering and fat portions upon the altar" (i.e., the sin and peace-offerings, not the thank-offerings merely, as Knobel supposes, according to his mistaken theory). The appearance of the glory of Jehovah is probably to be regarded in this instance, and also in <a href="/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-7.htm">Numbers 17:7</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20-6.htm">Numbers 20:6</a>, as the sudden flash of a miraculous light, which proceeded from the cloud that covered the tabernacle, probably also from the cloud in the most holy place, or as a sudden though very momentary change of the cloud, which enveloped the glory of the Lord, into a bright light, from which the fire proceeded in this instance in the form of lightning, and consumed the sacrifices upon the altar. The fire issued "from before the face of Jehovah," i.e., from the visible manifestation of Jehovah. It did not come down from heaven, like the fire of Jehovah, which consumed the sacrifices of David and Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>).<p>The Rabbins believe that this divine fire was miraculously sustained upon the altar until the building of Solomon's temple, at the dedication of which it fell from heaven afresh, and then continued until the restoration of the temple-worship under Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-16.htm">2 Chronicles 33:16</a>; cf. Buxtorf exercitatt. ad histor. ignis sacri, c. 2); and the majority of them maintain still further, that it continued side by side with the ordinary altar-fire, which was kindled by the priests (<a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>), and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-6.htm">Leviticus 6:6</a>, kept constantly burning by them. The earlier Christian expositors are for the most part of opinion, that the heavenly fire, which proceeded miraculously from God and burned the first sacrifices of Aaron, was afterwards maintained by the priests by natural means (see J. Marckii sylloge diss. philol. theol. ex. vi. ad <a href="/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>). But there is no foundation in the Scriptures for either of these views. There is not a syllable about any miraculous preservation of the heavenly fire by the side of the fire which the priests kept burning by natural means. And even the modified opinion of the Christian theologians, that the heavenly fire was preserved by natural means, rests upon the assumption, which there is nothing to justify, that the sacrifices offered by Aaron were first burned by the fire which issued from Jehovah, and therefore that the statements in the text, with reference to the burning of the fat portions and burnt-offerings, or causing them to ascend in smoke (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-10.htm">Leviticus 9:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm">Leviticus 9:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/9-20.htm">Leviticus 9:20</a>), are to be regarded as anticipations (per anticipationem accipienda, C. a Lap.), i.e., are to be understood as simply meaning, that when Aaron officiated at the different sacrifices, he merely laid upon the altar the pieces intended for it, but without setting them on fire. The fallacy of this is proved, not only by the verb &#1492;&#1511;&#1496;&#1497;&#1512; but by the fact implied in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>, that the offering of these sacrifices, with which Aaron entered upon his office, was preceded by the daily morning burnt-offering, and consequently that at the time when Aaron began to carry out the special sacrifices of this day there was fire already burning upon the altar, and in fact a continual fire, that was never to be allowed to go out (<a href="/leviticus/6-6.htm">Leviticus 6:6</a>). Even, therefore, if we left out of view the fire of the daily morning and evening sacrifice, which had been offered from the first day on which the tabernacle was erected (<a href="/exodus/40-29.htm">Exodus 40:29</a>), there were sacrifices presented every day during the seven days of the consecration of the priests (ch. 8); and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>, Moses must necessarily have prepared the fire for these. If it had been the intention of God, therefore, to originate the altar-fire by supernatural means, this would no doubt have taken place immediately after the erection of the tabernacle, or at least at the consecration of the altar, which was connected with that of the priests, and immediately after it had been anointed (<a href="/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>). But as God did not do this, the burning of the altar-sacrifices by a fire which proceeded from Jehovah, as related in this verse, cannot have been intended to give a sanction to the altar-fire as having proceeded from God Himself, which was to be kept constantly burning, either by miraculous preservation, or by being fed in a natural way. The legends of the heathen, therefore, about altar-fires which had been kindled by the gods themselves present no analogy to the fact before us (cf. Serv. ad Aen. xii. 200; Solin. v. 23; Pausan. v. 27, 3; Bochart, Hieroz. lib. ii. c. 35, pp. 378ff.; Dougtaei analect. ss. pp. 79ff.).<p>The miracle recorded in this verse did not consist in the fact that the sacrificial offerings placed upon the altar were burned by fire which proceeded from Jehovah, but in the fact that the sacrifices, which were already on fire, were suddenly consumed by it. For although the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; admits of both meanings, setting on fire and burning up (see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>), the word literally denotes consuming or burning up, and must be taken in the stricter and more literal sense in the case before us, inasmuch as there was already fire upon the altar when the sacrifices were placed upon it. God caused this miracle, not to generate a supernatural altar-fire, but ut ordinem sacerdotalem legis veteris a se institutum et suas de sacrificio leges hoc miraculo confirmaret et quasi obsignaret (C. a Lap.), or to express it bore briefly, to give a divine consecration to the altar, or sacrificial service of Aaron and his sons, through which a way was to be opened for the people to His throne of grace, and whereby, moreover, the altar-fire was consecrated eo ipso into a divine, i.e., divinely appointed, means of reconciliation to the community. The whole nation rejoiced at this glorious manifestation of the satisfaction of God with this the first sacrifice of the consecrated priests, and fell down upon their faces to give thanks to the Lord for His mercy. </body></html>
