Let us profit by the solemn warning this history conveys. When professing worshippers come with zeal without knowledge, carnal affections, earthly, light, vain, trifling thoughts, the devices of will-worship, instead of the offering of soul and spirit; then the incense is kindled by a flame which never came down from heaven, which the Spirit of a holy God never sent within their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wave breast and heave shoulder - See <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15.

This burning (as opposed to eating by the priests) should only have taken place, if (as was not done in this case) the blood had been brought into the ‘tent of meeting.’ Moses is angry with Aaron’s sons, but they acted under direction, and Aaron acknowledges his responsibility by replying.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Jehovah still further commanded Aaron and his sons not to drink wine and strong drink when they entered the tabernacle to perform service there, on pain of death, as a perpetual statute for their generations (<a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a>), that they might be able to distinguish between the holy and common, the clean and unclean, and also to instruct the children of Israel in all the laws which God had spoken to them through Moses (&#1493;...&#1493;, <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>, et...et, both...and also).

Everything was common (profane) which was not fitted for the sanctuary, even what was allowable for daily use and enjoyment, and therefore was to be regarded as clean. The motive for laying down on this particular occasion a prohibition which was to hold good for all time, seems to lie in the event recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1</a>, although we can hardly infer from this, as some commentators have done, that Nadab and Abihu offered the unlawful incense-offering in a state of intoxication. The connection between their act and this prohibition consisted simply in the rashness, which had lost the clear and calm reflection that is indispensable to right action. </body></html>
