Under his instructions, Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar eat the remainder of <span class="cmt_word">the meat offering</span> (<a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), in the court of the tabernacle, and reserve <span class="cmt_word">the wave breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">heave shoulder</span> to <span class="cmt_word">eat in a clean place</span>, that is, not necessarily within the court; but he finds that the sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), which ought to be eaten by the priests, had been burnt. The rule was that, when the blood was presented in the tabernacle, the flesh was burned; when it was not, the flesh was eaten by the priests. In the present case, the blood had not been brought within the holy place, and yet the flesh had been burned instead of being eaten. Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, and demanded an explanation. Aaron's plea of defense was twofold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> His sons had fulfilled aright the ritual of their own sin offering and burnt offering, that is, the offerings made for the priests, and it had been rather his duty than theirs to see that the ritual of the sin offering of the congregation had been properly carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The state of distress in which he was, and the near escape that he had had from ceremonial defilement, and the sense of sin brought home to him by his children's death, had made him unfit and unable to eat the sin offering of the people, as he should have done under other circumstances. With this plea Moses was content. It was true that the letter of the Law had been broken, but there was a sufficient cause for it (see <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). It appears from hence that the expiation wrought by the sin offering was not complete until the whole ceremony was accomplished, the last act of which was the eating of the flesh by the priests in one class of sin offering, and the burning the flesh outside the camp in the other. It has been questioned, what is the full meaning of the expression, God hath given it you - the flesh of the sin offering - to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord. Archdeacon Freeman expresses the view of A Lapide, Keil, and many others when he says that, by eating the flesh of the offering, the priests "in a deep mystery neutralized, through the holiness vested in them by their consecration, the sin which the offerer had laid upon the victim and upon them" ('Principles of Divine Service,' part 2). Oehler, on the other hand (Herzog's 'Cyclop.,' 10), maintains that the priests did no more by this act than <span class="accented">declare</span> the removal of the sin already taken away; with which accords Philo's explanation ('De Vict.,' 13, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 6.) that the object of the sacrificial meal was to carry assurance of acceptance to the offerer, "since God would never have allowed his servants to partake of it had there not been a complete removal and forgetting of the sin atoned for." Neither of these explanations seems to be altogether satisfactory. The former attributes more meaning to the expression <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> than it appears to have elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> and <a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, where Aaron is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity of the holy things</span> and <span class="accented">of the sanctuary</span>; and <a href="/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>, where the prophet is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> of Israel and Judah. The latter interpretation appears too much to evacuate the meaning of the words. It is quite certain that the part of the ceremony by which the atonement was wrought (if it was wrought by any one part) was the offering of the blood for the covering of the offerer's sins, but yet this action of the priests in eating the flesh of the victim was in some way also connected with the atonement, not only with the assurance of its having been wrought; but in what way this was effected we are not told, and cannot pronounce. The words <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> are equivalent to making atonement for by taking the sin in some sense upon themselves (cf. <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, "He shall bear their iniquities," and <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, "Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away [or beareth] the sin of the world'). Accordingly, Bishop Patrick comments: "The very eating of the people's sin offering argued the sins of the people were, <span class="accented">in some sort</span>, laid upon the priests, to be taken away by them. From whence the sacrifice of Christ may be explained, who is said to <span class="accented">bear our iniquity</span> (as the priest is here said to do), all our sins being laid on him, who took upon him to make an expiation for them by the sacrifice of himself. For the priest, hereby eating of the sin offering, receiving the guilt upon himself, may well be thought to prefigure One who should be both Priest and Sacrifice for sin; which was accomplished in Christ" (on <a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses prohibited Aaron and his remaining sons from showing any sign of mourning on account of this fatal calamity. "Uncover not your heads," i.e., do not go about with your hair dishevelled, or flowing free and in disorder (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>). &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; does not signify merely uncovering the head by taking off the head-band (lxx, Vulg., Kimchi, etc.), or by shaving off the hair (Ges. and others; see on the other hand Knobel on <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>), but is to be taken in a similar sense &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, the free growth of the hair, not cut short with scissors (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a>). It is derived from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, to let loose from anything (<a href="/proverbs/1-25.htm">Proverbs 1:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5</a>, etc.), to let a people loose, equivalent to giving them the reins (<a href="/exodus/32-25.htm">Exodus 32:25</a>), and signifies solvere crines, capellos, to leave the hair in disorder, which certainly implies the laying aside of the head-dress in the case of the priest, though without consisting in this alone. On this sign of mourning among the Roman and other nations, see M. Geier de Ebraeorum luctu viii. 2. The Jews observe the same custom still, and in times of deep mourning neither wash themselves, nor cut their hair, nor pare their nails (see Buxtorf, Synog. jud. p. 706). They were also not to rend their clothes, i.e., not to make a rent in the clothes in front of the breast-a very natural expression of grief, by which the sorrow of the heart was to be laid bare, and one which was not only common among the Israelites (<a href="/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/44-13.htm">Genesis 44:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-31.htm">2 Samuel 13:31</a>), but was very widely spread among the other nations of antiquity (cf. Geier l.c. xxii. 9). &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, to rend, occurs, in addition to this passage, in <a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; in other places &#1508;&#1512;&#1506;, to tear in pieces, is used. Aaron and his sons were to abstain from these expressions of sorrow, "lest they should die and wrath come upon all the people." Accordingly, we are not to seek the reason for this prohibition merely in the fact, that they would defile themselves by contact with the corpses, a reason which afterwards led to this prohibition being raised into a general law for the high priest (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10-11</a>). The reason was simply this, that any manifestation of grief on account of the death that had occurred, would have indicated dissatisfaction with the judgment of God; and Aaron and his sons would thereby not only have fallen into mortal sin themselves, but have brought down upon the congregation the wrath of God, which fell upon it through every act of sin committed by the high priest in his official position (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). "Your brethren, (namely) the whole house of Israel, may bewail this burning" (the burning of the wrath of Jehovah). Mourning was permitted to the nation, as an expression of sorrow on account of the calamity which had befallen the whole nation in the consecrated priests. For the nation generally did not stand in such close fellowship with Jehovah as the priests, who had been consecrated by anointing. </body></html>
