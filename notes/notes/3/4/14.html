When sacrifices were offered, the persons, on whose behalf they were devoted, were to lay their hands on the heads of the victims, and to confess their sins. The elders were to do so, when the sacrifices were offered for the whole congregation. The load of sin was supposed then to be borne by the guiltless animal. When the offering is completed, it is said, atonement is made, and the sin shall be forgiven. The saving of churches and kingdoms from ruin, is owing to the satisfaction and mediation of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the sin ... is known - Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-31.htm">1 Samuel 14:31-35</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-21. if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance&#8212;In consequence of some culpable neglect or misapprehension of the law, the people might contract national guilt, and then national expiation was necessary. The same sacrifice was to be offered as in the former case, but with this difference in the ceremonial, that the elders or heads of the tribes, as representing the people and being the principal aggressors in misleading the congregation, laid their hands on the head of the victim. The priest then took the blood into the holy place, where, after dipping his finger in it seven times, he sprinkled the drops seven times before the veil. This done, he returned to the court of the priests, and ascending the altar, put some portion upon its horns; then he poured it out at the foot of the altar. The fat was the only part of the animal which was offered on the altar; for the carcass, with its appurtenances and offals, was carried without the camp, into the place where the ashes were deposited, and there consumed with fire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Against it; </span> against any one of the said commandments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A young bullock; </span> but if the sin of the congregation was only the omission of some ceremonial duty, a kid of the goats was to be offered, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/15-24.htm" title="Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet smell to the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.">Numbers 15:24</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When the sin which they have sinned against it,....
