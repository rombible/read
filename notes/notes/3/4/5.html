and in these the patriarchs had respect to sin, to make atonement for it. But the Jews were now put into a way of making atonement for sin, more particularly by sacrifice, as a shadow of good things to come; yet the substance is Christ, and that one offering of himself, by which he put away sin. The sins for which the sin-offerings were appointed are supposed to be open acts. They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which ought not to have been done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment: yet what had been omitted at one time, might be done at another; but a sin committed was past recall. They are supposed to be sins committed through ignorance. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest. It is evident that God never had any infallible priest in his church upon earth, when even the high priest was liable to fall into sins of ignorance. All pretensions to act without error are sure marks of Antichrist. The beast was to be carried without the camp, and there burned to ashes. This was a sign of the duty of repentance, which is the putting away sin as a detestable thing, which our soul hates. The sin-offering is called sin. What they did to that, we must do to our sins; the body of sin must be destroyed, Ro 6:6. The apostle applies the carrying this sacrifice without the camp to Christ, Heb 13:11-13.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The treatment of the blood was special in the sin-offerings.

Sin Offering for the Priest.<p>3. If the priest that is anointed do sin&#8212;that is, the high priest, in whom, considering his character as typical mediator, and his exalted office, the people had the deepest interest; and whose transgression of any part of the divine law, therefore, whether done unconsciously or heedlessly, was a very serious offense, both as regarded himself individually, and the influence of his example.

The fat tails which the sheep have in Northern Africa and Egypt, also in Arabia, especially Southern Arabia, and Syria, often weigh 15 lbs. or more, and small carriages on wheels are sometimes placed under them to bear their weight (Sonnini, R. ii. p. 358; Bochart, Hieroz. i. pp. 556ff.). It consists of something between marrow and fat. Ordinary sheep are also found in Arabia and Syria; but in modern Palestine all the sheep are "of the broad-tailed species." The broad part of the tail is an excresence of fat, from which the true tail hangs down (Robinson, Pal. ii. 166). "Near the rump-bone shall he (the offerer) take it (the fat tail) away," i.e., separate it from the body. &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., is, according to Saad., os caudae s. coccygis, i.e., the rump or tail-bone, which passes over into the vertebrae of the tail (cf. Bochart, i. pp. 560-1). In <a href="/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a> and <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a> the fat portions which were burned are called "food of the firing for Jehovah," or "food of the firing for a sweet savour," i.e., food which served as a firing for Jehovah, or reached Jehovah by being burned; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-24.htm">Numbers 28:24</a>, "food of the firing of a sweet savour for Jehovah." Hence not only are the daily burnt-offerings and the burnt and sin-offerings of the different feasts called "food of Jehovah" ("My bread," <a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>); but the sacrifices generally are described as "the food of God" ("the bread of their God," <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-21.htm">Leviticus 21:21-22</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/22-25.htm">Leviticus 22:25</a>), as food, that is, which Israel produced and caused to ascend to its God in fire as a sweet smelling savour. - Nothing is determined here with regard to the appropriation of the flesh of the peace-offerings, as their destination for a sacrificial meal was already known from traditional custom. The more minute directions for the meal itself are given in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-36</a>, where the meaning of these sacrifices is more fully explained. - In <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a> (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>) the general rule is added, "all fat belongs to Jehovah," and the law, "eat neither fat nor blood," is enforced as "an eternal statute" for the generations of Israel (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>) in all their dwelling-places (see <a href="/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-20.htm">Exodus 12:20</a>). </body></html>
