This is the case in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a>, &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>, and other words in the critical edition of the Psalter which has been carefully revised by B&#1492;r according to the Masora, and published with an introduction by Delitzsch.

Every transgression of a divine command, whether it took place consciously or unconsciously, brought guilt, and demanded a sin-offering for its expiation; and this was to be presented as soon as the sin was known. The sin-offering, which the elders had to offer in the name of the congregation, was to consist of a young ox, and was to be treated like that of the high priest (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14-23</a> compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>), inasmuch as "the whole congregation" included the priesthood, or at any rate was on an equality with the priesthood by virtue of its calling in relation to the Lord. &#1495;&#1496;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500; signifies to incur guilt upon (on the foundation of) sin (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a>, etc.); it is usually construed with an accusative (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/4-28.htm">Leviticus 4:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-6.htm">Leviticus 5:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>, etc.), or with &#1489;&#1468;, to sin with a sin (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>). The subject of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1496; (<a href="/leviticus/4-15.htm">Leviticus 4:15</a>) is one of the elders.
