According to the authorities during the second Temple, these fifty shekels covered the value of the produce for the whole period of forty-nine years, that is, from one jubile year to another, so that a plot of land of the dimensions here described was estimated at a little more than one shekel per annum. The person who made the vow could, under these circumstances, always redeem it, as it would almost amount to a gift to let any stranger buy it at this price. The low value put upon it was evidently designed not to deprive the family of their means of subsistence, since the patrimonial estates were almost always the only source of their livelihood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/27-16.htm" title="And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.">Leviticus 27:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Shall sanctify some part of his field — </span>This intimates that it was not lawful for a man to vow his whole field or estate, because God would have no man’s family made beggars to enrich his sanctuary.

If it requires a homer, or five bushels and a half, of barley seed to crop it, the redemption price is fifty shekels, or &pound;6 9s. 2d., plus one-fifth, that is, &pound;7 15s., supposing that the vow had been made in the year succeeding the jubilee; but if the vow was made at any time after the jubile, the value of the previous harvests was deducted from this sum. The amount does not seem to have been paid in a lump sum, but by annual installments of one shekel and one-fifth of a shekel, equal to 3s. 1 1/5 d., each year. In case he had sold his interest in the field up to the approaching jubilee before making his vow, then no redemption was allowed; he paid nothing, but the field passed from him to the sanctuary at the jubilee. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When animals were vowed, of the cattle that were usually offered in sacrifice, everything that was given to Jehovah of these (i.e., dedicated to Him by vowing) was to be holy and not changed, i.e., exchanged, a good animal for a bad, or a bad one for a good. But if such an exchange should be made, the animal first dedicated and the one substituted were both to be holy (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-9.htm">Leviticus 27:9</a>, <a href="/leviticus/27-10.htm">Leviticus 27:10</a>). The expression "it shall be holy" unquestionably implies that an animal of this kind could not be redeemed; but if it was free from faults, it was offered in sacrifice: if, however, it was not fit for sacrifice on account of some blemish, it fell to the portion of the priests for their maintenance like the first-born of cattle (cf. <a href="/leviticus/27-33.htm">Leviticus 27:33</a>). </body></html>
