If the animal so presented was ‘unclean,’ and as such could not lawfully be offered to God, the priest was to set upon it a value in proportion to its worth, whereupon the owner might sell it for that sum and pay over the amount.

The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498;, "according to thy (Moses') valuation," it is more simple to regard as an apodosis, so as to supply to &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; the substantive verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, than as a fuller description of the protasis, in which case the apodosis would follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-3.htm">Leviticus 27:3</a>, and the verb &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; would have to be supplied. But whatever may be the conclusion adopted, in any case this thought is expressed in the words, that souls, i.e., persons, were to be vowed to the Lord according to Moses' valuation, i.e., according to the price fixed by Moses. This implies clearly enough, that whenever a person was vowed, redemption was to follow according to the valuation. Otherwise what was the object of valuing them? Valuation supposes either redemption or purchase. But in the case of men (i.e., Israelites) there could be no purchasing as slaves, and therefore the object of the valuing could only have been for the purpose of redeeming, buying off the person vowed to the Lord, and the fulfilment of the vow could only have consisted in the payment into the sanctuary of the price fixed by the law.<p>(Note: Saalschtz adopts this explanation in common with the Mishnah. Oehler is wrong in citing <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-11.htm">1 Samuel 2:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a> as a proof of the opposite. For the dedication of Samuel did not consist of a simple vow, but was a dedication as a Nazarite for the whole of his life, and Samuel was thereby vowed to service at the sanctuary, whereas the law says nothing about attachment to the sanctuary in the case of the simple vowing of persons. But because redemption in the case of persons was not left to the pleasure or free-will of the person making the vow as in the case of material property, no addition is made to the valuation price as though for a merely possible circumstance.)</body></html>
