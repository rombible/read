The minimum, however, which he was obliged to pay during the second Temple was one shekel. If anyone neglected paying his vows to the Temple treasury, his goods were seized by the officials. This, however, had to be done in such a manner as not to deprive the man of his means of subsistence. The bailiffs were obliged to leave a mechanic two sets of tools, a husbandman a yoke of oxen, and a donkey driver his donkey. They were bound to leave food sufficient for thirty days, and bedding for twelve months; and they could never seize the man’s sandals or phylacteries, or his wife’s property, or his children’s clothes.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-13 Zeal for the service of God disposed the Israelites, on some occasions, to dedicate themselves or their children to the service of the Lord, in his house for life.

When a man shall make a singular vow, &c.&#8212;Persons have, at all times and in all places, been accustomed to present votive offerings, either from gratitude for benefits received, or in the event of deliverance from apprehended evil. And Moses was empowered, by divine authority, to prescribe the conditions of this voluntary duty.<p>the persons shall be for the Lord, &c.&#8212;better rendered thus:&#8212;"According to thy estimation, the persons shall be for the Lord." Persons might consecrate themselves or their children to the divine service, in some inferior or servile kind of work about the sanctuary (1Sa 3:1). In the event of any change, the persons so devoted had the privilege in their power of redeeming themselves; and this chapter specifies the amount of the redemption money, which the priest had the discretionary power of reducing, as circumstances might seem to require. Those of mature age, between twenty and sixty, being capable of the greatest service, were rated highest; young people, from five till twenty, less, because not so serviceable; infants, though devotable by their parents before birth (1Sa 1:11), could not be offered nor redeemed till a month after birth; old people were valued below the young, but above children; and the poor&#8212;in no case freed from payment, in order to prevent the rash formation of vows&#8212;were rated according to their means.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If he be poorer than thy estimation; </span> if after his vow he be decayed and impoverished, and not able to pay the price which thou, according to the rules here given, requirest of him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to his ability; </span> which God also considered in other cases, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/12-8.htm" title="And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.">Leviticus 12:8</a></span>.

The words &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498;, "according to thy (Moses') valuation," it is more simple to regard as an apodosis, so as to supply to &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; the substantive verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, than as a fuller description of the protasis, in which case the apodosis would follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-3.htm">Leviticus 27:3</a>, and the verb &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; would have to be supplied. But whatever may be the conclusion adopted, in any case this thought is expressed in the words, that souls, i.e., persons, were to be vowed to the Lord according to Moses' valuation, i.e., according to the price fixed by Moses. This implies clearly enough, that whenever a person was vowed, redemption was to follow according to the valuation. Otherwise what was the object of valuing them? Valuation supposes either redemption or purchase. But in the case of men (i.e., Israelites) there could be no purchasing as slaves, and therefore the object of the valuing could only have been for the purpose of redeeming, buying off the person vowed to the Lord, and the fulfilment of the vow could only have consisted in the payment into the sanctuary of the price fixed by the law.<p>(Note: Saalschtz adopts this explanation in common with the Mishnah. Oehler is wrong in citing <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-11.htm">1 Samuel 2:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a> as a proof of the opposite. For the dedication of Samuel did not consist of a simple vow, but was a dedication as a Nazarite for the whole of his life, and Samuel was thereby vowed to service at the sanctuary, whereas the law says nothing about attachment to the sanctuary in the case of the simple vowing of persons. But because redemption in the case of persons was not left to the pleasure or free-will of the person making the vow as in the case of material property, no addition is made to the valuation price as though for a merely possible circumstance.)</body></html>
