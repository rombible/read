According to the authorities during the second Temple, anyone was allowed to redeem the tithes due from another person by paying the exact value for them, without the addition of the fifth part. The tithes could then be eaten in any place, but the redemption money had to be taken to Jerusalem, where it was spent in sociable feasts, to which the Levite, the stranger, and the poor were invited.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:26-33 Things or persons devoted, are distinguished from things or persons that were only sanctified. Devoted things were most holy to the Lord, and could neither be taken back nor applied to other purposes. Whatever productions they had the benefit, God must be honoured with the tenth of, if it could be applied. Thus they acknowledge God to be the Owner of their land, the Giver of its fruits, and themselves to be his tenants, and dependants upon him. Thus they gave him thanks for the plenty they enjoyed, and besought his favour in the continuance of it. We are taught to honour the Lord with our substance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Devoted thing - The primary meaning of the Heb. word &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#772;rem is something cut off, or shut up. Its specific meaning in the Law is, that which is cut off from common use and given up in some sense to Yahweh, without the right of recal or commutation. It is applied to a field wholly appropriated to the sanctuary <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>, and to whatever was doomed to destruction <a href="/1_samuel/15-21.htm">1 Samuel 15:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>. Our translators have often rendered the word by "cursed," or "a curse," which in some places may convey the right sense, but it should be remembered that the terms are not identical in their compass of meaning (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-18</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>, etc. Compare <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p>Of man and beast - This passage does not permit human sacrifices. Man is elsewhere clearly recognized as one of the creatures which were not to be offered in sacrifice <a href="/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-20.htm">Exodus 34:20</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15</a>.<p>Therefore the application of the word &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#772;rem to man is made exclusively in reference to one rightly doomed to death and, in that sense alone, given up to Yahweh. The man who, in a right spirit, either carries out a sentence of just doom on an offender, or who, with a single eye to duty, slays an enemy in battle, must regard himself as God's servant rendering up a life to the claim of the divine justice (compare <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>). It was in this way that Israel was required to destroy the Canaanites at Hormah (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm">Numbers 21:2-3</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>), and that Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>. In all such instances, a moral obligation rests upon him whose office it is to take the life: he has to look upon the object of his stroke as under a ban to the Lord (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). Therefore, there can be neither redemption nor commutation.<p>It is evident that the righteousness of this law is not involved in the sin of rash or foolish vows, such as Saul's <a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a> or Jephthah's <a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>.<p>And it seems hardly needful to add that sacrifice, as it is represented both in the Law and in the usage of the patriarchs, is something very different from consecration under a ban, though a tiring to be sacrificed might come under the designation of &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;  che&#772;rem in its wider sense. The sacrifice was always the offering up of the innocent life of a creature chosen, approved, and without spot or blemish. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30-33. all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land&#8212;This law gave the sanction of divine authority to an ancient usage (Ge 14:20; 28:22). The whole produce of the land was subjected to the tithe tribute&#8212;it was a yearly rent which the Israelites, as tenants, paid to God, the owner of the land, and a thank offering they rendered to Him for the bounties of His providence.

The use of this redemption, as Jarchi suggests, was, that he might have liberty of eating it in any place: for he understands it of the second tithe, as before observed, and which was to be eaten at Jerusalem. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if a man will at all redeem <i>ought</i> of his tithes, he shall add thereto the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> fifth <i>part</i> thereof.</span><p>(p) Besides the value of the thing itself.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All valuations were to be made according to the shekel of the sanctuary. </body></html>
