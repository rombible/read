The blood is now allowed for the nourishment of our bodies; it is no longer appointed to make an atonement for the soul.

I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people&#8212;The face of God is often used in Scripture to denote His anger (Ps 34:16; Re 6:16; Eze 38:18). The manner in which God's face would be set against such an offender was, that if the crime were public and known, he was condemned to death; if it were secret, vengeance would overtake him. (See on [44]Ge 9:4). But the practice against which the law is here pointed was an idolatrous rite. The Zabians, or worshippers of the heavenly host, were accustomed, in sacrificing animals, to pour out the blood and eat a part of the flesh at the place where the blood was poured out (and sometimes the blood itself) believing that by means of it, friendship, brotherhood, and familiarity were contracted between the worshippers and the deities. They, moreover, supposed that the blood was very beneficial in obtaining for them a vision of the demon during their sleep, and a revelation of future events. The prohibition against eating blood, viewed in the light of this historic commentary and unconnected with the peculiar terms in which it is expressed, seems to have been levelled against idolatrous practices, as is still further evident from Eze 33:25, 26; 1Co 10:20, 21.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. I will be an enemy to him, and execute vengeance upon him immediately; because such persons probably would do this in private, so as the magistrate could not know nor punish it.

Some restrain this to the blood of the sacrifices before treated of; but Jarchi observes, lest any should think, because it is said, it is "the blood that maketh the atonement for the soul": that a man is not guilty only on account of the blood of sanctified things, therefore it is said "any manner of blood": <p>I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood; signifying how greatly he should be provoked thereby, how much he should resent it, how exceedingly displeasing it would be to him, and what severity might be expected to be exercised towards him for it; for dreadful it is to have the face of God set against a man, see <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>.

"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat," was given as a command to Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). It has already been repeated twice in the Book of Leviticus (<a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>), and it is still again found in chapter Leviticus 19:26; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>. The present is the <span class="accented">locus classicus</span> which explains the earnestness with which the rule is enforced. It begins with an extension of the obligation from the Israelites to the sojourners among them, and with a solemn declaration that, in case of transgression, God will take into his own bands the punishment of the offenders; not only is he to be cut off or excommunicated by political or ecclesiastical authority, but God himself will <span class="cmt_word">set his face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people,</span> by death, or such means as he chooses to adopt. Then follows the reason for the prohibition. <span class="cmt_word">For the life of the flesh is in the blood.</span> The blood may not be eaten because it is the vehicle of life, literally, <span class="accented">the soul of the flesh</span>, that is, it is the seat of the animal life of the body. "It is the fountain of life," says Harvey; "the first to live, the last to die, and the primary seat of the animal soul; it lives and is nourished of itself, and by no other part of the human body." In consequence of possessing this character, it is to be reserved, <span class="cmt_word">to make an atonement for your souls upon the altar;</span> for thus only blood became qualified for the purpose of atonement. The clause, <span class="cmt_word">for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul,</span> should be translated, <span class="accented">for the blood maketh atonement by means of the soul, i.e.</span>, by means of the life which it contains. It is because the blood is the vehicle of the animal's life, and represents that life, that it serves to cover, or make atonement for, the soul of the offerer of the sacrifice, who presents it instead of his own life. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Whoever of the house of Israel slaughtered an ox, sheep, or goat, either within or outside the camp, without bringing the animal to the tabernacle, to offer a sacrifice therefrom to the Lord, "blood was to be reckoned to him;" that is to say, as the following expression, "he hath shed blood," shows, such slaughtering was to be reckoned as the shedding of blood, or blood-guiltiness, and punished with extermination (see <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>). The severity of this prohibition required some explanation, and this is given in the reason assigned in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5-7</a>, viz., "that the Israelites may bring their slain-offerings, which they slay in the open field, before the door of the tabernacle, as peace-offerings to Jehovah," and "no more offer their sacrifices to the &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, after whom they go a whoring" (<a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>). This reason presupposes that the custom of dedicating the slain animals as sacrifices to some deity, to which a portion of them was offered, was then widely spread among the Israelites. It had probably been adopted from the Egyptians; though this is not expressly stated by ancient writers: Herodotus (i. 132) and Strabo (xv. 732) simply mentioning it as a Persian custom, whilst the law book of Manu ascribes it to the Indians. To root out this idolatrous custom from among the Israelites, they were commanded to slay every animal before the tabernacle, as a sacrificial gift to Jehovah, and to bring the slain-offerings, which they would have slain in the open field, to the priest at the tabernacle, as shelamim (praise-offerings and thank-offerings), that he might sprinkle the blood upon the altar, and burn the fat as a sweet-smelling savour for Jehovah (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2-5</a>). "The face of the field" (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-7.htm">Leviticus 14:7</a>, <a href="/leviticus/14-53.htm">Leviticus 14:53</a>): the open field, in distinction from the enclosed space of the court of Jehovah's dwelling. "The altar of Jehovah" is spoken of in <a href="/leviticus/17-6.htm">Leviticus 17:6</a> instead of "the altar" only (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>, etc.), on account of the contrast drawn between it and the altars upon which they offered sacrifice to Seirim. &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, literally goats, is here used to signify daemones (Vulg.), "field-devils" (Luther), demons, like the &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>, who were supposed to inhabit the desert (<a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>), and whose pernicious influence they sought to avert by sacrifices. The Israelites had brought this superstition, and the idolatry to which it gave rise, from Egypt. The Seirim were the gods whom the Israelites worshipped and went a whoring after in Egypt (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-27.htm">Ezekiel 23:27</a>). Both the thing and the name were derived from the Egyptians, who worshipped goats as gods (Josephus c. <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>, 7), particularly Pan, who was represented in the form of a goat, a personification of the male and fertilizing principle in nature, whom they called Mendes and reckoned among the eight leading gods, and to whom they had built a splendid and celebrated temple in Thmuis, the capital of the Mendesian Nomos in Lower Egypt, and erected statues in the temples in all directions (cf. Herod. 2, 42, 46; Strabo, xvii. 802; Diod. Sic. i. 18). The expression "a statute for ever" refers to the principle of the law, that sacrifices were to be offered to Jehovah alone, and not to the law that every animal was to be slain before the tabernacle, which was afterwards repealed by Moses, when they were about to enter Canaan, where it could no longer be carried out (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>). </body></html>
