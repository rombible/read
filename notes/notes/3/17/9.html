When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place, but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the tabernacle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The strangers which sojourn - The foreigners who dwell.

The severity of this prohibition required some explanation, and this is given in the reason assigned in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5-7</a>, viz., "that the Israelites may bring their slain-offerings, which they slay in the open field, before the door of the tabernacle, as peace-offerings to Jehovah," and "no more offer their sacrifices to the &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, after whom they go a whoring" (<a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>). This reason presupposes that the custom of dedicating the slain animals as sacrifices to some deity, to which a portion of them was offered, was then widely spread among the Israelites. It had probably been adopted from the Egyptians; though this is not expressly stated by ancient writers: Herodotus (i. 132) and Strabo (xv. 732) simply mentioning it as a Persian custom, whilst the law book of Manu ascribes it to the Indians. To root out this idolatrous custom from among the Israelites, they were commanded to slay every animal before the tabernacle, as a sacrificial gift to Jehovah, and to bring the slain-offerings, which they would have slain in the open field, to the priest at the tabernacle, as shelamim (praise-offerings and thank-offerings), that he might sprinkle the blood upon the altar, and burn the fat as a sweet-smelling savour for Jehovah (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2-5</a>). "The face of the field" (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/14-7.htm">Leviticus 14:7</a>, <a href="/leviticus/14-53.htm">Leviticus 14:53</a>): the open field, in distinction from the enclosed space of the court of Jehovah's dwelling. "The altar of Jehovah" is spoken of in <a href="/leviticus/17-6.htm">Leviticus 17:6</a> instead of "the altar" only (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>, etc.), on account of the contrast drawn between it and the altars upon which they offered sacrifice to Seirim. &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, literally goats, is here used to signify daemones (Vulg.), "field-devils" (Luther), demons, like the &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>, who were supposed to inhabit the desert (<a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>), and whose pernicious influence they sought to avert by sacrifices. The Israelites had brought this superstition, and the idolatry to which it gave rise, from Egypt. The Seirim were the gods whom the Israelites worshipped and went a whoring after in Egypt (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm">Ezekiel 23:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm">Ezekiel 23:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-21.htm">Ezekiel 23:21</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/23-27.htm">Ezekiel 23:27</a>). Both the thing and the name were derived from the Egyptians, who worshipped goats as gods (Josephus c. <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>, 7), particularly Pan, who was represented in the form of a goat, a personification of the male and fertilizing principle in nature, whom they called Mendes and reckoned among the eight leading gods, and to whom they had built a splendid and celebrated temple in Thmuis, the capital of the Mendesian Nomos in Lower Egypt, and erected statues in the temples in all directions (cf. Herod. 2, 42, 46; Strabo, xvii. 802; Diod. Sic. i. 18). The expression "a statute for ever" refers to the principle of the law, that sacrifices were to be offered to Jehovah alone, and not to the law that every animal was to be slain before the tabernacle, which was afterwards repealed by Moses, when they were about to enter Canaan, where it could no longer be carried out (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>). </body></html>
