When they entered Canaan, this only continued in respect of sacrifices. The spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer, are not confined to any one place. We have now no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift; nor does the gospel unity rest only in one place, but in one heart, and the unity of the Spirit. Christ is our Altar, and the true Tabernacle; in him God dwells among men. It is in him that our sacrifices are acceptable to God, and in him only. To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. And though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not therefore neglect attending at the tabernacle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, May bring their beasts for slaughter, which they (now) slaughter in the open field. even that they may bring them before Yahweh to the entrance of the tent of meeting unto the priests, and slaughter them as peace-offerings to Yahweh.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The yearly repetition of the general atonement showed that the sacrifices of the law were not sufficient to make the servant of God perfect according to this own conscience. And this imperfection of the expiation, made with the blood of bullocks and goats, could not fail to awaken a longing for the perfect sacrifice of the eternal High Priest, who has obtained eternal redemption by entering once, through His own blood, into the holiest of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7-12</a>). And just as this was effected negatively, so by the fact that the high priest entered on this day into the holiest of all, as the representative of the whole congregation, and there, before the throne of God, completed its reconciliation with Him, was the necessity exhibited in a positive manner for the true reconciliation of man, and his introduction into a perfect and abiding fellowship with Him, and the eventual realization of this by the blood of the Son of God, our eternal High Priest and Mediator, prophetically foreshadowed. The closing words in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-34.htm">Leviticus 16:34</a>, "and he (i.e., Aaron, to whom Moses was to communicate the instructions of God concerning the feast of atonement, <a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>) did as the Lord commanded Moses," are anticipatory in their character, like <a href="/exodus/12-50.htm">Exodus 12:50</a>. For the law in question could not be carried out till the seventh month of the current year, that is to say, as we find from a comparison of <a href="/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>, not till after the departure of Israel from Sinai. </body></html>
