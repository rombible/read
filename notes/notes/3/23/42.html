Christ's tabernacling on earth in human nature, might also be prefigured. And it represents the believer's life on earth: a stranger and pilgrim here below, his home and heart are above with his Saviour. They would the more value the comforts and conveniences of their own houses, when they had been seven days dwelling in the booths. It is good for those who have ease and plenty, sometimes to learn what it is to endure hardness. The joy of harvest ought to be improved for the furtherance of our joy in God. The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; therefore whatever we have the comfort of, he must have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected. God appointed these feasts, Beside the sabbaths and your free-will offerings.

The seven days of abode in the booths of the festival was thus a fair symbol of the forty years of abode in tents in the wilderness. The Feast might well become the appointed memorial of this period of their history for the ages to come.<p>All that are Israelites born - The omission of the foreigners in this command is remarkable. Perhaps the intention was that on this joyous occasion they were to be hospitably entertained as guests.

It began on the fifteenth day of the month, corresponding to the end of our September and beginning of October, which was observed as a Sabbath; and it could be celebrated only at the place of the sanctuary, offerings being made on the altar every day of its continuance. The Jews were commanded during the whole period of the festival to dwell in booths, which were erected on the flat roofs of houses, in the streets or fields; and the trees made use of are by some stated to be the citron, the palm, the myrtle, and the willow, while others maintain the people were allowed to take any trees they could obtain that were distinguished for verdure and fragrance. While the solid branches were reserved for the construction of the booths, the lighter branches were carried by men, who marched in triumphal procession, singing psalms and crying "Hosanna!" which signifies, "Save, we beseech thee!" (Ps 118:15, 25, 26). It was a season of great rejoicing. But the ceremony of drawing water from the pool, which was done on the last day, seems to have been the introduction of a later period (Joh 7:37). That last day was the eighth, and, on account of the scene at Siloam, was called "the great day of the feast." The feast of ingathering, when the vintage was over, was celebrated also on that day [Ex 23:16; 34:22], and, as the conclusion of one of the great festivals, it was kept as a sabbath.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Booths</span> were erected in their cities or towns, either in their streets or gardens, or the tops of their houses, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm" title="So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.">Nehemiah 8:16</a></span>, which were made flat, and therefore were proper and fit for that use. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye shall dwell in booths seven days,.... So that it seems they were not obliged to dwell in them on the eighth day, which was an holy convocation, a sabbath in which no servile work was to be done as the first, <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>. The eighth day was a day by itself, a sort of an appendage to the feast of tabernacles, when they went into their houses again, and kept it as an holy day; and perhaps principally in giving thanks for the ingathering of the fruits of the earth, to which this seems to be appropriated from <a href="/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39</a>. According to the Jewish writers, they did not go out of their booths until they had dined in them on this day; and as they went out used to say,"may it be the will of God that we may be worthy the next year to dwell in the booth of Leviathan (c);''that is, to feast with the Messiah in the world to come. And to those days the Jews have added a ninth, which they call "the joy of the law", and which they keep for joy of having finished the reading of the law; which being divided into as many sections or lessons as weeks in the year, were so ordered to be read as to be finished at this time (d): <p>all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths; the Targum of Jonathan is,"all the males in Israel, and even the little ones, that do not need their mothers, sit in the shades blessing their Creator, when they enter there.''And, according to the Misnah (e), women, servants, and little ones, are free from the booths (i.e. are not obliged to dwelt in one), but a little one, who hath no need of its mother, is obliged to dwell in the booths: and elsewhere it is said, that sick persons, and such as wait upon them, are not obliged, nor messengers upon any business, nor travellers and watchmen in cities, and keepers of gardens and orchards; if such travel, or keep watch in the day, they are obliged to be in them at night, and if in the night, then they are to dwell in them in the day (f). Jarchi says, that everyone born in Israel comprehends proselytes, who were bound by this law. <p>(c) Lebush, par. 2. c. 668. sect. 5. (d) Buxtorf. Synagog. Jud. c. 27.

Moreover, on the eighth day, i.e., the 22nd of the month, the closing feast was to be observed in the same manner as on the first day (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>). The name, "feast of Tabernacles" (booths), is to be explained from the fact, that the Israelites were to dwell in booths made of boughs for the seven days that this festival lasted (<a href="/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42</a>). &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;, which is used in <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a> and <a href="/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a> for the eighth day, which terminated the feast of Tabernacles, and in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a> for the seventh day of the feast of Mazzoth, signifies the solemn close of a feast of several days, clausula festi, from &#1506;&#1510;&#1512; to shut in, or close (<a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>, etc.), not a coagendo, congregando populo ad festum, nor a cohibitione laboris, ab interdicto opere, because the word is only applied to the last day of the feasts of Mazzoth and Tabernacles, and not to the first, although this was also kept with a national assembly and suspension of work. But as these clausaulae festi were holidays with a holy convocation and suspension of work, it was very natural that the word should be transferred at a later period to feasts generally, on which the people suspended work and met for worship and edification (<a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>). The azareth, as the eighth day, did not strictly belong to the feast of Tabernacles, which was only to last seven days; and it was distinguished, moreover, from these seven days by a smaller number of offerings (<a href="/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a>.). The eighth day was rather the solemn close of the whole circle of yearly feasts, and therefore was appended to the close of the last of these feasts as the eighth day of the feast itself (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> seq.). - With <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a> the enumeration of all the yearly feasts on which holy meetings were to be convened is brought to an end. This is stated in the concluding formula (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-37.htm">Leviticus 23:37</a>, <a href="/leviticus/23-38.htm">Leviticus 23:38</a>), which answers to the heading in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>, in which the Sabbaths are excepted, as they simply belonged to the moadim in the more general sense of the word. In this concluding formula, therefore, there is no indication that <a href="/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a> and <a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39-43</a> are later additions to the original list of feasts which were to be kept with a meeting for worship. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; (to offer, etc.) is not dependent upon "holy convocations," but upon the main idea, "feasts of Jehovah." Jehovah had appointed moadim, fixed periods in the year, for His congregation to offer sacrifices; not as if no sacrifices could be or were to be offered except at these feasts, but to remind His people, through these fixed days, of their duty to approach the Lord with sacrifices. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; is defined by the enumeration of four principal kinds of sacrifice-burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, slain (i.e., peace-) offerings, and drink-offerings. &#1489;&#1468; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;: "every day those appointed for it," as in <a href="/exodus/5-13.htm">Exodus 5:13</a>. </body></html>
