Offerings were made to the Lord at his altar; and the people were taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and godly meditation. The sheaf of first-fruits was typical of the Lord Jesus, who is risen from the dead as the First-fruits of them that slept. Our Lord Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruits were offered. We are taught by this law to honour the Lord with our substance, and with the first-fruits of all our increase, Pr 3:9. They were not to eat of their new corn, till God's part was offered to him out of it; and we must always begin with God: begin every day with him, begin every meal with him, begin every affair and business with him; seek first the kingdom of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses contain a distinct command regarding the religious services immediately connected with the grain harvest, given by anticipation against the time when the people were to possess the promised land.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Le 23:9-14.

It has reference to the second day of Unleavened Bread, which is called <span class="cmt_word">the morrow after the sabbath</span>, the first day of the feast being meant by <span class="accented">the sabbath</span>, on whatever day of week it may have occurred. It was on this second day that the presentation of the first or wave sheaf of barley took place, according to the command, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.</span> Which command was fulfilled in the following manner. "Already, on the 14th of Nisan, the spot whence the first sheaf was to be reaped bad been marked out by delegates from the Sanhedrim, by tying together in bundles, while still standing, the barley that was to be cut down. Though for obvious reasons it was customary to choose for the purpose the sheltered Ashes valley across Kedron, there was no restriction on that point, provided the barley had grown in an ordinary field - of course in Palestine itself - and not in garden or orchard land, and that the soil had not been manured nor yet artificially watered. When the time for cutting the sheaf had arrived, that is, on the evening of the 15th of Nisan (even though it was a sabbath)just as the sun went down, three men, each with a sickle and basket, formally set to work. But in order clearly to bring out all that was distinctive in the ceremony, they first asked of the bystanders three times each of these questions: 'Has the sun gone down?' 'With this sickle?' 'Into this basket?' ' On this sabbath?' (or first Passover day); and lastly, 'Shall I reap?' Having been each time answered in the affirmative, they cut down barley to the amount of one ephah, or ten omers, or three seahs, which is equal to about three pecks and three pints of our English measure. The ears were brought into the court of the temple" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The sheaf composed of these ears (for the Authorized Version is right in considering that it is the sheaf, and not the omer of flour made out of the ears of barley, that is meant by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, though Josephus and the Mishna take it the other way) was on the following day waved by the priests before the Lord, in token of its consecration, and through it, of the consecration of the whole barley crop to the Lord. With it was offered the burnt offering of a lamb, a meat offering double the usual quantity, and a drink offering. This passage and verses 18 and 37, are the only places in the Book of Leviticus where the drink offering is mentioned. Until the waving of the sheaf, <span class="cmt_word">neither bread nor parched corn, nor green ears</span>, that is, no grain in any form, might be eaten. We may imagine how delicacies made of the new flour would at once appear in the streets as soon as the sheaf had been waved. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the head of these moadim stood the Sabbath, as the day which God had already sanctified as a day of rest for His people, by His own rest on the seventh creation-day (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). On &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, see at <a href="/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a> and <a href="/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>. As a weekly returning day of rest, the observance of which had its foundation in the creative work of God, the Sabbath was distinguished from the yearly feasts, in which Israel commemorated the facts connected with its elevation into a people of God, and which were generally called "feasts of Jehovah" in the stricter sense, and as such were distinguished from the Sabbath (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-37.htm">Leviticus 23:37</a>, <a href="/leviticus/23-38.htm">Leviticus 23:38</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-31.htm">1 Chronicles 23:31</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-3.htm">2 Chronicles 31:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-34.htm">Nehemiah 10:34</a>). This distinction is pointed out in the heading, "these are the feasts of Jehovah" (<a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>).<p>(Note: Partly on account of his repetition, and partly because of the supposed discrepancy observable in the fact, that holy meetings are not prescribed for the Sabbath in the list of festal sacrifices in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> and 29, Hupfield and Knobel maintain that the words of <a href="/leviticus/23-2.htm">Leviticus 23:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>, from &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; to &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, notwithstanding their Elohistic expression, were not written by the Elohist, but are an interpolation of the later editor. The repetition of the heading, however, cannot prove anything at all with the constant repetitions that occur in the so-called Elohistic groundwork, especially as it can be fully explained by the reason mentioned in the text. And the pretended discrepancy rests upon the perfectly arbitrary assumption, that <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> and 29 contain a complete codex of all the laws relating to all the feasts. How totally this assumption is at variance with the calendar of feasts, is clear enough from the fact, that no rule is laid down there for the observance of the Sabbath, with the exception of the sacrifices to be offered upon it, and that even rest from labour is not commanded. Moreover Knobel is wrong in identifying the "holy convocation" with a journey to the sanctuary, whereas appearance at the tabernacle to hold the holy convocations (for worship) was not regarded as necessary either in the law itself or according to the later orthodox custom, but, on the contrary, holy meetings for edification were held on the Sabbath in every place in the land, and it was out of this that the synagogues arose.)<p>In <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11</a> the feast of new moon follows the Sabbath; but this is passed over here, because the new moon was not to be observed either with sabbatical rest or a holy meeting. </body></html>
