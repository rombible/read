Also it invited to rejoice in God, and become strangers and pilgrims on earth, which was denoted by the feast of Tabernacles, observed in the same month. At the beginning of the year, they were called by this sound of trumpet to shake off spiritual drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and to amend them. The day of atonement was the ninth day after this; thus they were awakened to prepare for that day, by sincere and serious repentance, that it might indeed be to them a day of atonement. The humbling of our souls for sin, and the making our peace with God, is work that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind. On that day God spake peace to his people, and to his saints; therefore they must lay aside all their wordly business, that they might the more clearly hear that voice of joy and gladness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A sabbath - Here and in <a href="/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39</a> a word which should rather be rendered a sabbatical rest.<p>Blowing of trumpets - Here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1</a>, literally "shouting". There is no mention of trumpets in the Hebrew text of the Law in connection with the day. However, there is no reason to doubt the tradition that the day was distinguished by a general blowing of trumpets throughout the land, and that the kind of trumpet generally used for the purpose was the curved horn of an animal or a cornet of metal, such as was used at Sinai <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, and on the Day of Jubilee <a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>. It must have differed in this respect from the ordinary festival of the New moon when the long straight trumpet of the temple alone was blown (<a href="/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>; see cut).<p>Seventh month - Called by the Jews in later times it was called Tisri, but in the Old Testament Ethanim, <a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>. According to the uniform voice of tradition "the first day" of this month was the first day of the Civil year in use before the Exodus, and was observed as the festival of the New year. Some have viewed it as a commemoration of the Creation of the world <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> : others, as the anniversary of the giving of the Law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

This phrase, which is a kind of preface to each precept, seems to be used to distinguish one from another, as the preceding one from the feast of Pentecost; and here, the day of atonement from that of the blowing of the trumpets; and afterwards, the feast of tabernacles from the day of atonement; the reason why it is not used before the feast of Pentecost seems to be, because, as Aben Ezra observes, that depended upon the wave sheaf, and was reckoned from it: <p>saying; as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26–32</span>.

Here it is reintroduced as one of the holy days. It is the one Jewish fast; to be observed as a day of <span class="cmt_word">holy convocation</span>, a day in which to <span class="cmt_word">afflict your souls</span> and to <span class="cmt_word">offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord</span>, and in which <span class="cmt_word">no manner of work</span> was to be done; inasmuch as, like the weekly sabbath, it was <span class="cmt_word">a sabbath of rest</span> from <span class="cmt_word">the ninth</span> day <span class="cmt_word">of the month at even, from even unto even</span>. The time of year at which it was appointed shows that one purpose of its institution was to make solemn preparation for the joyous festival of Tabernacles, which was to follow in five days' time, when the people ought to be in a state of reconciliation with God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The priest shall wave them (the two lambs of the peace-offerings), together with the loaves of the first-fruits, as a wave-offering before Jehovah; with the two lambs (the two just mentioned), they (the loaves) shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest." In the case of the peace-offerings of private individuals, the flesh belonged for the most part to the offerer; but here, in the case of a thank-offering presented by the congregation, it was set apart for the priest. The circumstance, that not only was a much more bountiful burnt-offering prescribed than in the offerings of the dedicatory sheaf at the commencement of harvest (<a href="/leviticus/23-12.htm">Leviticus 23:12</a>), but a sin-offering and peace-offering also, is to be attributed to the meaning of the festival itself, as a feast of thanksgiving for the rich blessing of God that had just been gathered in. The sin-offering was to excite the feeling and consciousness of sin on the part of the congregation of Israel, that whilst eating their daily leavened bread they might not serve the leaven of their old nature, but seek and implore from the Lord their God the forgiveness and cleansing away of their sin. Through the increased burnt-offering they were to give practical expression to their gratitude for the blessing of harvest, by a strengthened consecration and sanctification of all the members of the whole man to the service of the Lord; whilst through the peace-offering they entered into that fellowship of peace with the Lord to which they were called, and which they were eventually to enjoy through His blessing in their promised inheritance. In this way the whole of the year's harvest was placed under the gracious blessing of the Lord by the sanctification of its commencement and its close; and the enjoyment of their daily food was also sanctified thereby. For the sake of this inward connection, the laws concerning the wave-sheaf and wave-loaves are bound together into one whole; and by this connection, which was established by reckoning the time for the feast of Weeks from the day of the dedication of the sheaf, the two feasts were linked together into an internal unity. The Jews recognised this unity from the very earliest times, and called the feast of Pentecost Azqereth (Greek, &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;), because it was the close of the seven weeks (see at <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; Josephus, Ant. iii.10).<p>(Note: A connection between the feast of Pentecost and the giving of the law, which Maimonides (a.d. &#8224; 1205) was the first to discover, is not only foreign to the Mosaic law, but to the whole of the Jewish antiquity; and even Abarbanel expressly denies it.) </body></html>
