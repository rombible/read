This law is repeated from <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a>; and as Aben Ezra observes, the feast of weeks being the feast of the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, it is repeated, that they might not forget what God had commanded them to do at that time, namely, to leave somewhat for the poor; and the Jewish writers (a) observe, that this law, being put among the solemn feasts of the passover, pentecost, and tabernacles, and the beginning of the year, and the day of atonement, teaches, that he that observes it, and leaves the corner of the field and the gleanings to the poor, it is as if he built the sanctuary, and offered his sacrifices in the midst of it; but a much better reason may be given for it, which was, to teach them that when they expressed their thankfulness to God, they should exercise charity and liberality to the poor: <p>thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a>, <p>thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God; See Gill on <a href="/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>. <p>(a) In Torat Cohenim, apud Yalkut in loc. &amp; Jarchi. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">And when … harvest</span>] Probably inserted here from <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.">Leviticus 19:9</a> (also H), with which it is verbally identical.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye reap the harvest of your land.</span> The legislator pauses in his enunciation of the festivals to add the rule of charity, already laid down in the nineteenth chapter, as to leaving the gleanings unto the poor, and to the stranger. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The law for the special observance of the feast of Harvest (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>) is added here without any fresh introductory formula, to show at the very outset the close connection between the two feasts. Seven whole weeks, or fifty days, were to be reckoned from the day of the offering of the sheaf, and then the day of first-fruits (<a href="/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>) or feast of Weeks (<a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>) was to be celebrated. From this reckoning the feast received the name of Pentecost (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;, <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>). That &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a>) signifies weeks, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>, and &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>), is evident from the predicate &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;, "complete," which would be quite unsuitable if Sabbath-days were intended, as a long period might be reckoned by half weeks instead of whole, but certainly not by half Sabbath-days. Consequently "the morrow after the seventh Sabbath" (<a href="/leviticus/23-16.htm">Leviticus 23:16</a>) is the day after the seventh week, not after the seventh Sabbath. On this day, i.e., fifty days after the first day of Mazzoth, Israel was to offer a new meat-offering to the Lord, i.e., made of the fruit of the new harvest (<a href="/leviticus/26-10.htm">Leviticus 26:10</a>), "wave-loaves" from its dwellings, two of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour baked leavened, like the bread which served for their daily food, "as first-fruits unto the Lord," and of the wheat-harvest (<a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>), which fell in the second half of May and the first weeks of June (Robinson, Palestine), and therefore was finished as a whole by the feast of Weeks. The loaves differed from all the other meat-offerings, being made of leavened dough, because in them their daily bread was offered to the Lord, who had blessed the harvest, as a thank-offering for His blessing. They were therefore only given to the Lord symbolically by waving, and were then to belong to the priests (<a href="/leviticus/23-20.htm">Leviticus 23:20</a>). The injunction "out of your habitations" is not to be understood, as Calvin and others suppose, as signifying that every householder was to present two such loaves; it simply expresses the idea, that they were to be loaves made for the daily food of a household, and not prepared expressly for holy purposes. </body></html>
