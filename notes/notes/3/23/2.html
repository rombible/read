Though the yearly feasts were made more remarkable by general attendance at the sanctuary, yet these must not be observed more than the sabbath. On that day they must withdraw from all business of the world. It is a sabbath of rest, typifying spiritual rest from sin, and rest in God. God's sabbaths are to be religiously observed in every private house, by every family apart, as well as by families together, in holy assemblies. The sabbath of the Lord in our dwellings will be their beauty, strength, and safety; it will sanctify, build up, and glorify them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The feasts - literally, the appointed times.
