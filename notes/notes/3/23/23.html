Also it invited to rejoice in God, and become strangers and pilgrims on earth, which was denoted by the feast of Tabernacles, observed in the same month. At the beginning of the year, they were called by this sound of trumpet to shake off spiritual drowsiness, to search and try their ways, and to amend them. The day of atonement was the ninth day after this; thus they were awakened to prepare for that day, by sincere and serious repentance, that it might indeed be to them a day of atonement. The humbling of our souls for sin, and the making our peace with God, is work that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind. On that day God spake peace to his people, and to his saints; therefore they must lay aside all their wordly business, that they might the more clearly hear that voice of joy and gladness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The repetition of the Law (see the margin reference) is appropriately connected with the thanksgiving for the completed grain harvest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Le 23:23-25.

This has been called the Festival of the New Year. It is probable that the first day of the 7th month was associated with the reckoning of the commencement of a year (see further on <a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm" title="Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.">Leviticus 25:9</a>). There was evidently more than one mode of dating. In fact the Mishna (Tal. Bab. <span class="ital">Rôsh Hashânâh</span>, fol. 2a) gives four several months according to the purpose intended in each case. The old Hebrew year began in the autumn, as the Jewish civil year does now, while the Babylonian calendar made it commence in Nisan or March. If we consider the festival in the text to be a celebration of the New Year, it will be a survival of the old mode of reckoning. In Exodus 12 :2 P makes the year commence in spring, though this dating does not necessarily imply a Babylonian influence. Indications of a spring commencement in the times of the monarchy are found in <a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.">2 Samuel 11:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-22.htm" title="And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.">1 Kings 20:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-26.htm" title="And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.">1 Kings 20:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-10.htm" title="And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 36:10</a>, as referring to the time when kings go forth to war.

Three festivals, the Blowing of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, the Feast of Tabernacles (P).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-25</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the seventh month, in the first day of the month.</span> Only one of the monthly festivals is named in this chapter, because it is the only one on which a holy convocation was to be held. The first day of the seventh month we should expect to be holier than the first day of any other month, on account of the peculiar holiness of the seventh month, and because it was the beginning of the civil year. It is to be a sabbath; that is, a festival observed by rest, and <span class="cmt_word">a memorial of blowing of trumpets</span>. The latter words should be rather rendered a <span class="accented">memorial of a joyful noise.</span> That these joyful sounds were made by blowing the cornet, we may well believe from the testimony of tradition, but the text of Holy Scripture does not state the fact, and the use of the word <span class="accented">trumpets</span> in place of "cornets" leads to a confusion. Every new moon, and among them that of the seventh month, was observed by the blowing of trumpets (<a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>), but the trumpets then blown differed in their use and shape from the cornet. The trumpet was a long-shaped, metal instrument, at first used to give the signal for marching, afterwards to serve as the sign of the arrival of the monthly festival; the cornet was an animal's horn, or, if not a real horn, an instrument formed in the shape of a horn, and it was used to express joyful emotions, answering somewhat to our modern bell-ringing in the West, or firing unloaded guns in the East. Besides the blowing of trumpets, special sacrifices were appointed for the first of each month, "two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs," with their meat and drink offerings, for a burnt offering, and "one kid of the goats" for a sin offering (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). On New Year's Day, which, from its difference from the other new moons, was an annual as well as a monthly feast, the special offerings were "one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs," with their meat and drink offerings for a burnt offering, and "one kid of the goats" for a sin offering; and these were to be in addition to the offerings made on the first day of each month (<a href="/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). It became a custom for the Levites to chant at the morning sacrifice <a href="/psalms/81.htm">Psalm 81</a>, and at the evening sacrifice <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>. The great joyfulness of the day is shown by the account given of its observance in the Book of Nehemiah. It was on the first day of the seventh month that Ezra read the Book of the Law publicly to the people, and when "the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law," Nehemiah and Ezra and the Levites said, "This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep....  Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength. So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them" (<a href="/nehemiah/8-9.htm">Nehemiah 8:9-12</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The law for the special observance of the feast of Harvest (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>) is added here without any fresh introductory formula, to show at the very outset the close connection between the two feasts. Seven whole weeks, or fifty days, were to be reckoned from the day of the offering of the sheaf, and then the day of first-fruits (<a href="/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>) or feast of Weeks (<a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>) was to be celebrated. From this reckoning the feast received the name of Pentecost (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;, <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>). That &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a>) signifies weeks, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>, and &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>), is evident from the predicate &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;, "complete," which would be quite unsuitable if Sabbath-days were intended, as a long period might be reckoned by half weeks instead of whole, but certainly not by half Sabbath-days. Consequently "the morrow after the seventh Sabbath" (<a href="/leviticus/23-16.htm">Leviticus 23:16</a>) is the day after the seventh week, not after the seventh Sabbath. On this day, i.e., fifty days after the first day of Mazzoth, Israel was to offer a new meat-offering to the Lord, i.e., made of the fruit of the new harvest (<a href="/leviticus/26-10.htm">Leviticus 26:10</a>), "wave-loaves" from its dwellings, two of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour baked leavened, like the bread which served for their daily food, "as first-fruits unto the Lord," and of the wheat-harvest (<a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>), which fell in the second half of May and the first weeks of June (Robinson, Palestine), and therefore was finished as a whole by the feast of Weeks. The loaves differed from all the other meat-offerings, being made of leavened dough, because in them their daily bread was offered to the Lord, who had blessed the harvest, as a thank-offering for His blessing. They were therefore only given to the Lord symbolically by waving, and were then to belong to the priests (<a href="/leviticus/23-20.htm">Leviticus 23:20</a>). The injunction "out of your habitations" is not to be understood, as Calvin and others suppose, as signifying that every householder was to present two such loaves; it simply expresses the idea, that they were to be loaves made for the daily food of a household, and not prepared expressly for holy purposes. </body></html>
