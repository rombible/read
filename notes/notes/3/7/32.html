When the sacrifice was killed, the offerer himself must present God's part of it; that he might signify his cheerfully giving it up to God. He was with his own hands to lift it up, in token of his regard to God as the God of heaven; and then to wave it to and fro, in token of his regard to God as the Lord of the whole earth. Be persuaded and encouraged to feed and feast upon Christ, our Peace-offering. This blessed Peace-offering is not for the priests only, for saints of the highest rank and greatest eminence, but for the common people also. Take heed of delay. Many think to repent and return to God when they are dying and dropping into hell; but they should eat the peace-offering, and eat it now. Stay not till the day of the Lord's patience be run out, for eating the third day will not be accepted, nor will catching at Christ when thou art gone to hell!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wave-offering ... heave-offering - The latter appears to be used (like &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;  qorba&#770;n, <a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a>) for offerings in general.

According to <a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1 Samuel 2:13</a> ff. the worshipper was apparently allowed to decide for himself how much to give. The priestly portion assigned in <a href="/1_samuel/9-24.htm" title="And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before you, and eat: for to this time has it been kept for you since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.">1 Samuel 9:24</a> to Saul as a mark of honour was ‘the thigh, and the fat tail.’ (See note on p. 12.) The legislation of Deut. (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-3.htm" title="And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>) gives the priest ‘the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.’ But here (cp. <a href="/leviticus/10-14.htm" title="And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall you eat in a clean place; you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they be your due, and your sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.">Leviticus 10:14</a> f.; <a href="/exodus/29-27.htm" title="And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:">Exodus 29:27</a> f.) he was still better off with the wave breast and right thigh.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The fat of cattle that had fallen (&#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;), or been torn to pieces (viz., by beasts of prey), was not to be eaten, because it was unclean and defiled the eater (<a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-8.htm">Leviticus 22:8</a>); but it might be applied "to all kinds of uses," i.e., to the common purposes of ordinary life. Knobel observes on this, that "in the case of oxen, sheep, and goats slain in the regular way, this was evidently not allowable. But the law does not say what was to be done with the fat of these animals." Certainly it does not disertis verbis; but indirectly it does so clearly enough. According to <a href="/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3</a>., during the journey through the desert any one who wanted to slaughter an ox, sheep, or goat was to bring the animal to the tabernacle as a sacrificial gift, that the blood might be sprinkled against the altar, and the fat burned upon it. By this regulation every ordinary slaughtering was raised into a sacrifice, and the law determined what was to be done with the fat. Now if afterwards, when the people dwelt in Canaan, cattle were allowed to be slaughtered in any place, and the only prohibition repeated was that against eating blood (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15-16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-21.htm">Deuteronomy 12:21</a>.), whilst the law against eating fat was not renewed; it follows as a matter of course, that when the custom of slaughtering at the tabernacle was restricted to actual sacrifices, the prohibition against eating the fat portions came to an end, so far as those animals were concerned with were slain for consumption and not as sacrifices. The reason for prohibiting fat from being eaten was simply this, that so long as every slaughtering was a sacrifice, the fat portions, which were to be handed over to Jehovah and burned upon the altar, were not to be devoted to earthly purposes, because they were gifts sanctified to God. The eating of the fat, therefore, was neither prohibited on sanitary or social grounds, viz., because fat was injurious to health, as Maimonides and other Rabbins maintain, nor for the purpose of promoting the cultivation of olives, as Michaelis supposes, nor to prevent its being put into the unclean mouth of man, as Knobel imagines; but as being an illegal appropriation of what was sanctified to God, a wicked invasion of the rights of Jehovah, which was to be punished with extermination according to the analogy of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30-31</a>. The prohibition of blood in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-27.htm">Leviticus 7:27</a>, extends to birds and cattle; fishes not being mentioned, because the little blood which they possess is not generally eaten. This prohibition Israel was to observe in all its dwelling-places (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-20.htm">Exodus 12:20</a>, cf. <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>), not only so long as all the slaughterings had the character of sacrifices, but for all ages, because the blood was regarded as the soul of the animal, which God had sanctified as the medium of atonement for the soul of man (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), whereby the blood acquired a much higher degree of holiness than the fat. </body></html>
