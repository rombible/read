The three methods of preparing the Meal-Offering specified in this verse are also enumerated in <a href="/context/leviticus/2-4.htm" title="And if you bring an oblation of a meat offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil....">Leviticus 2:4-7</a> (see notes there). Many commentators distinguish between these <span class="ital">cooked</span> forms of the Meal-offering (here assigned to the priest who offereth it) and the other Meal-Offerings ‘mingled with oil’ described in <a href="/context/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:...">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/2-14.htm" title="And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears....">Leviticus 2:14-16</a>, and ‘dry’ Meal-Offerings, such as the Sin-Offering of the poor man (<a href="/leviticus/5-11.htm" title="But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:11</a>) and the jealousy-offering (<a href="/numbers/5-15.htm" title="Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.">Numbers 5:15</a>). These belong to ‘all the sons of Aaron one as well as another’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/7-10.htm" title="And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.">Leviticus 7:10</a></span>). No reason is here given for this different assignment of the Meal-Offerings. All the Meal-Offerings of ch. 2 are mingled with oil, and according to the Jewish traditional interpretation ‘the meal-offering mingled with oil’ includes all the offerings of ch. 2, and the ‘dry’ offering refers to the Sin-Offering of the poor man, and the jealousy-offering. In <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm" title="And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-10.htm" title="And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:10</a> and <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm" title="And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.">Leviticus 6:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it.
