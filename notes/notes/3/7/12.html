The rule which obtained during the second Temple with regard to this offering was as follows :—The offerer brought twenty tenths or pottles of fine flour; ten of them he made leavened and ten he left unleavened. He made the leavened into ten cakes, and of the ten that were unleavened he made thirty cakes. These thirty unleavened cakes, which were made with half a log of oil, were divided into three tens, and each ten was prepared in a different manner; that is, ten with an eighth of the oil were baked in the oven, ten with another eighth of the oil were made into wafers, and ten with a fourth of the oil were hastily fried. Of the forty cakes the priest received four, one of each sort, thus obtaining a tenth part.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm" title="If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.">Leviticus 7:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">If he offer it for a thanksgiving — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">על תודה</span>, <span class="ital">gnal todah, for confession, </span>it being accompanied with a public confession or acknowledgment of the mercies and deliverances which the offerer had received from God.

The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement.
