The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease.

But if any part of it remained till the third day, it was, instead of being made use of, to be burned with fire. In the East, butcher-meat is generally eaten the day it is killed, and it is rarely kept a second day, so that as a prohibition was issued against any of the flesh in the peace offerings being used on the third day, it has been thought, not without reason, that this injunction must have been given to prevent a superstitious notion arising that there was some virtue or holiness belonging to it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That it might neither putrefy, and thereby be exposed to contempt; nor yet be reserved either for superstitious abuse, or for the priest’s domestic use, which would savour of covetousness, and of distrust of God’s care for their future provisions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day,....

To (lit., upon, in addition to) the sacrifice of thanksgiving (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>, "sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace-offerings," <a href="/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13</a> and <a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>) they were to present "unleavened cakes kneaded with oil, and flat cakes anointed with oil (see at <a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>), and roasted fine flour (see <a href="/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14</a>) mixed as cakes with oil," i.e., cakes made of fine flour roasted with oil, and thoroughly kneaded with oil (on the construction, see Ges. 139, 2; Ewald 284 a). This last kind of cakes kneaded with oil is also called oil-bread-cake ("a cake of oiled bread," <a href="/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-23.htm">Exodus 29:23</a>), or "cake unleavened, kneaded with oil" (<a href="/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2</a>), and probably differed from the former simply in the fact that it was more thoroughly saturated with oil, inasmuch as it was not only made of flour that had been mixed with oil in the kneading, but the flour itself was first of all roasted in oil, and then the dough was moistened still further with oil in the process of kneading. </body></html>
