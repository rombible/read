When the sacrifice was killed, the offerer himself must present God's part of it; that he might signify his cheerfully giving it up to God. He was with his own hands to lift it up, in token of his regard to God as the God of heaven; and then to wave it to and fro, in token of his regard to God as the Lord of the whole earth. Be persuaded and encouraged to feed and feast upon Christ, our Peace-offering. This blessed Peace-offering is not for the priests only, for saints of the highest rank and greatest eminence, but for the common people also. Take heed of delay. Many think to repent and return to God when they are dying and dropping into hell; but they should eat the peace-offering, and eat it now. Stay not till the day of the Lord's patience be run out, for eating the third day will not be accepted, nor will catching at Christ when thou art gone to hell!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No manner of blood - See <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-15</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Le 7:28-38.

The equal dignity of the peace offerings with the other offerings is vindicated by the command that the offerer <span class="cmt_word">shall bring it</span> with <span class="cmt_word">his own hands</span>, whereas it might have been regarded as merely the constituent part of a feast, and so sent by the hand of a servant. <span class="cmt_word">The breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">the right shoulder</span> were to be waved and heaved (for "heaved" does not merely mean" taken off," as some have said). The waving consisted of the priest placing his hands beneath those of the offerer who held the piece to be waved, and moving them slowly backwards and forwards before the Lord, to and from the altar; the heaving was performed by slowly lifting the pieces heaved upwards and downwards. The movements were made to show that the pieces, though not burnt on the altar, were yet in a special manner consecrated to God's service. <span class="accented">The right shoulder</span> was most probably the hind leg, perhaps the haunch. The Hebrew word is generally translated "leg" (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-35.htm">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>). This part was the perquisite of the officiating priest; the waved breast was given to the priests' common stock. Afterwards an addition was made to the priests' portion (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>; see <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the other hand, "the soul which eats flesh of the peace-offering, and his uncleanness is upon him (for "whilst uncleanness is upon him;" the suffix is to be understood as referring to &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; construed as a masculine, see <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), "shall be cut off" (see <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>). This was to be done, whether the uncleanness arose from contact with an unclean object (any unclean thing), or from the uncleanness of man (cf. ch. 12-15), or from an unclean beast (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4-8</a>), or from any other unclean abomination. &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1509;, abomination, includes the unclean fishes, birds, and smaller animals, to which this expression is applied in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-10.htm">Leviticus 11:10-42</a> (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>). Moreover contact with animals that were pronounced unclean so far as eating was concerned, did not produce uncleanness so long as they were alive, or if they had been put to death by man; but contact with animals that had died a natural death, whether they belonged to the edible animals or not, that is to say, with carrion (see at <a href="/leviticus/11-8.htm">Leviticus 11:8</a>).<p>There is appended to these regulations, as being substantially connected with them, the prohibition of fat and blood as articles of food (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-22.htm">Leviticus 7:22-27</a>). By "the fat of ox, or of sheep, or of goat," i.e., the three kinds of animals used in sacrifice, or "the fat of the beast of which men offer a firing to Jehovah" (<a href="/leviticus/7-25.htm">Leviticus 7:25</a>), we are to understand only those portions of fat which are mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3-4</a>, <a href="/leviticus/3-9.htm">Leviticus 3:9</a>; not fat which grows in with the flesh, nor the fat portions of other animals, which were clean but not allowed as sacrifices, such as the stag, the antelope, and other kinds of game. </body></html>
