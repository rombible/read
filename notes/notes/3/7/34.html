When the sacrifice was killed, the offerer himself must present God's part of it; that he might signify his cheerfully giving it up to God. He was with his own hands to lift it up, in token of his regard to God as the God of heaven; and then to wave it to and fro, in token of his regard to God as the Lord of the whole earth. Be persuaded and encouraged to feed and feast upon Christ, our Peace-offering. This blessed Peace-offering is not for the priests only, for saints of the highest rank and greatest eminence, but for the common people also. Take heed of delay. Many think to repent and return to God when they are dying and dropping into hell; but they should eat the peace-offering, and eat it now. Stay not till the day of the Lord's patience be run out, for eating the third day will not be accepted, nor will catching at Christ when thou art gone to hell!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wave-offering ... heave-offering - The latter appears to be used (like &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;  qorba&#770;n, <a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a>) for offerings in general.
