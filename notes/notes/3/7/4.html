The vessel, in which it was boiled for the priests to eat, was to be broken in pieces if it were of earthenware, and scoured (&#1502;&#1512;&#1511; Pual) and overflowed with water, i.e., thoroughly rinsed out, if it were of copper, lest any of the most holy flesh should adhere to the vessel, and be desecrated by its being used in the preparation of common food, or for other earthly purposes. It was possible to prevent this desecration in the case of copper vessels by a thorough cleansing; but not so with earthen vessels, which absorb the fat, so that it cannot be removed by washing. The latter therefore were to be broken in pieces, i.e., thoroughly destroyed. On the other hand, earthen vessels that had been defiled were also ordered to be broken to pieces, though for the very opposite reason (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-33.htm">Leviticus 11:33</a>, <a href="/leviticus/11-35.htm">Leviticus 11:35</a>). </body></html>
