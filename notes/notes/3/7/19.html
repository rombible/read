The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease. Therefore this law is not now in force on believers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was proper that the sacrificial meat should not be polluted by any approach to putrefaction. But the exclusion of a mean-spirited economy may further have furnished the ground for the distinction between the thank-offerings and the others. The most liberal distribution of the meat of the offering, particularly among the poor who were invited to partake, would plainly be becoming when the sacrifice was intended especially to express gratitude for mercies received. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. if any of the flesh of the sacrifice &#8230; be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither &#8230; imputed&#8212;The sacrifice will not be acceptable to God nor profitable to him that offers it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The flesh, </span> to wit, of the holy offering, of which he is here treating; and therefore the general word is to be so limited; for other flesh one might eat in this case, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.">Deu 12:15</a>,22</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That toucheth any unclean thing, </span> after its oblation; which might easily happen, as it was conveyed from the altar to the place where it was eaten; for it was not eaten in the holy place, as appears, because it was eaten by the priests, together with the offerers, who might not come thither. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As for the flesh, </span> i.e. the other flesh; that which shall not be polluted by any unclean touch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All that be clean, </span> whether priests or offerers, or guests invited to the feast.

That is, the flesh of the peace offerings; should it be touched by any unclean person, man or woman; that was so in a ceremonial sense, being profluvious or menstruous, or having touched anything unclean, or touched by any unclean creature, as a dog or the like, as it might be while carried from the tabernacle to any of their tents or houses: <p>it shall be burnt with fire; that no profit might be had of it; and this was to make them careful in carrying it from place to place: <p>and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof; that are clean in a ceremonial sense; as all that are clean in an evangelic sense, through the blood and righteousness of Christ, may, by faith, eat his flesh and drink his blood. Jarchi observes, that whereas it is said, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-27.htm">Deuteronomy 12:27</a> "thou shall eat the flesh"; some might object and say, that none might eat of the peace offerings but the owners of them, therefore it is said here, "all that be clean shall eat"; not the owners only, nor the priests and Levites only, but whoever the offerer should invite to eat thereof, provided he was but clean. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the flesh that toucheth any unclean <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> <i>thing</i> shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.</span><p>(k) After it is sacrificed.<p>(l) Of the peace offering that is clean.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19–21</span>.

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>, an azcarah of the unleavened pastry was burned upon the altar, although this is not specially mentioned here any more than at <a href="/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a> and <a href="/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a>; whereas none of the leavened bread-cake was placed upon the altar (<a href="/leviticus/2-12.htm">Leviticus 2:12</a>), but it was simply used as bread for the sacrificial meal. There is nothing here to suggest an allusion to the custom of offering unleavened sacrificial cakes upon a plate of leavened dough, as J. D. Michaelis, Winer, and others suppose. </body></html>
