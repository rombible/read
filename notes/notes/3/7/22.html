The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease.

Accordingly, in ch. 3, which treats of the Peace-Offering, the prohibition of fat and blood occurs in a short form (<span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/7-17.htm" title="But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.">Leviticus 7:17</a></span>). It is repeated here in connexion with the preceding regulations about Peace-Offerings. The fat which is prohibited is that contained in the portions reserved as an offering made by fire unto the Lord, described at length in chs. 3, 4 and <a href="/context/leviticus/7-3.htm" title="And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covers the inwards,...">Leviticus 7:3-5</a>. They were the same in the Peace-, Guilt-, and Sin-Offerings. The ordinary fat found with the flesh was not forbidden. <a href="/leviticus/7-25.htm" title="For whoever eats the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:25</a> explains that the portions which in a sacrifice are set apart for the Lord must not be consumed as food by man, even when the animals were not suitable to be offered on the altar, as in the case of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts. If the animal were fit to be offered, according to <a href="/context/leviticus/17-4.htm" title="And brings it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:...">Leviticus 17:4-5</a>, it must when killed be brought before the Lord, and these portions would be burnt on the altar by the priest. The prohibition extends only to the ox, sheep, or goat, i.e. to the animals which were brought for sacrifice, but the prohibition of blood (<span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/7-26.htm" title="Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.">Leviticus 7:26</a></span>) is more general. No manner of blood may be eaten, whether of fowl or beast.

Probably it was silently abrogated; but the prohibition of blood was undoubtedly perpetual (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>), and it is based on a principle which does not apply to the fat (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The flesh of the praise-offering was to be eaten on the day of presentation, and none of it was to be left till the next morning (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-29.htm">Leviticus 22:29-30</a>); but that of the vow and freewill-offerings might be eaten on both the first and second days. Whatever remained after that was to be burnt on the third day, i.e., to be destroyed by burning. If any was eaten on the third day, it was not well-pleasing (&#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; "good pleasure," see <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>), and was "not reckoned to the offerer," sc., as a sacrifice well-pleasing to God; it was "an abomination." &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, an abomination, is only applied to the flesh of the sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/19-7.htm">Leviticus 19:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-14.htm">Ezekiel 4:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>), and signifies properly a stench; - compare the talmudic word &#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; faetidum reddere. Whoever ate thereof would bear his sin (see <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). "The soul that eateth" is not to be restricted, as Knobel supposes, to the other participators in the sacrificial meal, but applies to the offerer also, in fact to every one who partook of such flesh. The burning on the third day was commanded, not to compel the offerer to invite the poor to share in the meal (Theodoret, Clericus, etc.), but to guard against the danger of a desecration of the meal. The sacrificial flesh was holy (<a href="/exodus/29-34.htm">Exodus 29:34</a>); and in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-8.htm">Leviticus 19:8</a>, where this command is repeated,<p>(Note: There is no foundation for Knobel's assertion, that in <a href="/leviticus/19-5.htm">Leviticus 19:5</a>. another early lawgiver introduces a milder regulation with regard to the thank-offering, and allows all the thank-offerings to be eaten on the second day. For <a href="/leviticus/19-5.htm">Leviticus 19:5</a>. does not profess to lay down a universal rule with regard to all the thank-offerings, but presupposes our law, and simply enforces its regulations with regard to the vow and freewill-offerings, and threatens transgressors with severe punishment.)<p>eating it on the third day is called a profanation of that which was holy to Jehovah, and ordered to be punished with extermination. It became a desecration of what was holy, through the fact that in warm countries, if flesh is not most carefully preserved by artificial means, it begins to putrefy, or becomes offensive (&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;) on the third day. But to eat flesh that was putrid or stinking, would be like eating unclean carrion, or the &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492; with which putrid flesh is associated in <a href="/ezekiel/4-14.htm">Ezekiel 4:14</a>. It was for this reason that burning was commanded, as Philo (de vict. p. 842) and Maimonides (More Neboch iii. 46) admit; though the former also associates with this the purpose mentioned above, which we decidedly reject (cf. Outram l.c. p. 185 seq., and Bhr, ii. pp. 375-6). </body></html>
