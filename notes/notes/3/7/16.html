The distinction between them, as defined by the canon law, which obtained in the time of Christ, is as follows :—A vow (<span class= "ital">nēdēr</span>) is an obligation voluntarily imposed upon oneself with the formula, “Behold, I take it upon myself to bring a bullock, &c., for a peace offering.” This undertaking is binding upon the person till he fulfils it. Hence, if the bullock in question dies, or is stolen, or becomes disqualified for a sacrifice, he must bring another. A free-will offering (<span class= "ital">nedabah</span>) simply pledges voluntarily a certain animal for a peace offering, with the formula, “ Behold, this animal I devote for a peace offering.” Hence, if the animal in question dies, or is stolen, or has otherwise become disqualified for sacrifice, the obligation ceases, since it does not extend beyond the animal thus devoted.<p><span class= "bld">It shall be eaten the same day.</span>—As both these votive offerings were an indirect mode of supplication having respect to future favours, and hence were not a spontaneous expression of pious devotion, they were not so sacred as the former. They were, therefore, allowed to be eaten both on the day of presentation and on the following day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/7-16.htm" title="But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:">Leviticus 7:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">If the sacrifice be a vow </span>— Offered in performance of a vow, the offerer having desired some special favour from God, and vowed the sacrifice to God if he would grant it. <span class="ital">A voluntary offering, </span>which a person offered freely to God, in testimony of his faith and love, not being under the obligation of any particular vow of his own, or command from God. <span class="ital">On the morrow also the remainder shall be eaten — </span>Which was not allowed in the case of the thank-offering.

The main reason why blood was forbidden of old, was because the Lord had appointed blood for an atonement. This use, being figurative, had its end in Christ, who by his death and blood-shedding caused the sacrifices to cease.

But if any part of it remained till the third day, it was, instead of being made use of, to be burned with fire. In the East, butcher-meat is generally eaten the day it is killed, and it is rarely kept a second day, so that as a prohibition was issued against any of the flesh in the peace offerings being used on the third day, it has been thought, not without reason, that this injunction must have been given to prevent a superstitious notion arising that there was some virtue or holiness belonging to it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be a vow; </span> offered in performance of a vow, the man having desired some special favour from God, and vowed the sacrifice to God if he would grant it.

This was probably the case also with the trespass-offerings and sin-offerings of the laity; whereas the skin of the peace-offerings belonged to the owner of the animal (see Mishnah, Sebach. 12, 3). - In <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a>, the following law is laid down with reference to the meat-offering, that everything baked in the oven, and everything prepared in a pot or pan, was to belong to the priest, who burned a portion of it upon the altar; and that everything mixed with oil and everything dry was to belong to all the sons of Aaron, i.e., to all the priests, to one as much as another, so that they were all to receive an equal share. The reason for this distinction is not very clear. That all the meat-offerings described in ch. 2 should fall to the sons of Aaron (i.e., to the priests), with the exception of that portion which was burned upon the altar as an azcarah, followed from the fact that they were most holy (see at <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>). As the meat-offerings, which consisted of pastry, and were offered in the form of prepared food (<a href="/leviticus/7-9.htm">Leviticus 7:9</a>), are the same as those described in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4-8</a>, it is evident that by those mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/2-10.htm">Leviticus 2:10</a> we are to understand the kinds described in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14-16</a>, and by the "dry," primarily the &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, which consisted of dried grains, to which oil was to be added (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; <a href="/leviticus/2-15.htm">Leviticus 2:15</a>), though not poured upon it, as in the case of the offering of flour (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>), and probably also in that of the sin-offerings and jealousy-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>, and <a href="/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15</a>), which consisted simply of flour (without oil). The reason therefore why those which consisted of cake and pastry fell to the lot of the officiating priest, and those which consisted of flour mixed with oil, of dry corn, or of simple flour, were divided among all the priests, was probably simply this, that the former were for the most part offered only under special circumstances, and then merely in small quantities, whereas the latter were the ordinary forms in which the meat-offerings were presented, and amounted to more than the officiating priests could possibly consume, or dispose of by themselves. </body></html>
