The vessel in which the flesh of the sin-offering was boiled must be broken, if it were an earthen one; but if a brazen one, well washed. This showed that the defilement was not wholly taken away by the offering; but the blood of Christ thoroughly cleanses from all sin. All these rules set forth the polluting nature of sin, and the removal of guilt from the sinner to the sacrifice. Behold and wonder at Christ's love, in that he was content to be made a sin-offering for us, and so to procure our pardon for continual sins and failings. He that knew no sin was made sin (that is, a sin-offering) for us, 2Co 5:21. Hence we have pardon, and not only pardon, but power also, against sin, Ro 8:3.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not be eaten - Compare <a href="/leviticus/6-30.htm">Leviticus 6:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Le 6:21-30.

The priests were to eat this as unleavened, i.e., to bake it without leaven, and to eat it in a holy place, viz., in the court of the tabernacle. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a> is explained by "it shall not be baken with leaven" in <a href="/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17</a>. It was the priests' share of the firings of Jehovah (see <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>), and as such it was most holy (see <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), like the sin-offering and trespass-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>), and only to be eaten by the male members of the families of the priests. This was to be maintained as a statute for ever (see at <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>). Every one that touches them (the most holy offerings) becomes holy." &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean he shall be holy, or shall sanctify himself (lxx, Vulg., Luth., a Lap., etc.), nor he is consecrated to the sanctuary and is to perform service there (Theodor., Knobel, and others). In this provision, which was equally applicable to the sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/6-27.htm">Leviticus 6:27</a>), to the altar of the burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>), and to the most holy vessels of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>), the word is not to be interpreted by <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2-3</a>, or <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>, or by the expression "shall be holy" in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-10.htm">Leviticus 27:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>, but by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a>, "touch me not, for I am holy." The idea is this, every layman who touched these most holy things became holy through the contact, so that henceforth he had to guard against defilement in the same manner as the sanctified priests (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), though without sharing the priestly rights and prerogatives. This necessarily placed him in a position which would involve many inconveniences in connection with ordinary life. </body></html>
