Any priest who ate the most holy things outside the wall of the courts, or the less holy things outside of the walls of Jerusalem, received forty stripes save one.<p><span class= "bld">Every one that toucheth them shall be holy.</span>—According to this rendering, which exhibits one of the views that obtained during the second Temple, the meaning is that any one who touches the sacrifices of the first order of holiness must not only be a descendant of Aaron and a male, but must have sanctified himself by undergoing the necessary ablutions. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/22-6.htm" title="The soul which has touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>.)

That is, <span class= "ital">whoso </span>or <span class= "ital">whatsoever toucheth them shall become holy. </span>Any layman or any ordinary utensil, &c., becomes sacred by touching one of the higher order of sanctity.

They themselves as well as the vessels from which they ate were typically holy, and they were not at liberty to partake of the meat offering while they labored under any ceremonial defilement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It may be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

And the priests answered and said, No.">Haggai 2:12</a>, the garment in which ‘holy flesh’ is carried, does not communicate holiness to the food which it may happen to touch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Holiness is here regarded as a contagious quality; contact with holy things must be avoided, just as contact with things that are considered unclean is forbidden. This similarity in the treatment of things which from the levitical standpoint are so widely separated as the holy and the unclean is a survival of primitive modes of expression, due to imperfect conception of the gods, and of their relations to men.
