The omission is probably accidental, and caused by the fact that sections 19–23 and 24–30 begin with the same words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These verses differ from the other precepts with reference to sacrifice in <a href="/leviticus/6-7.htm" title="And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he has done in trespassing therein.">Leviticus 6:7</a> to <a href="/leviticus/7-21.htm" title="Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:21</a>. They are not introduced by the words ‘This is the law of …,’ and addressed through Moses to Aaron and his sons, but are spoken directly to Moses (note the verbs in the 2nd person in <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-21.htm" title="In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat offering shall you offer for a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:21</a></span>). The command to present the Meal-Offering implies that Moses was officiating as priest, and he is represented as discharging this function during the seven days in which Aaron and his sons were consecrated; after that period all sacrificial acts were performed by Aaron and his sons (cp. chs. 8 and 9). The words ‘in the day when he [Aaron] is anointed’ (19) also connect the offering with the ceremony of consecration, and with the first of the seven days, or, if the words ‘in the day when’ be taken as ‘at the time when’ (cp. <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm" title="These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,">Genesis 2:4</a>), with the period of seven days. Neither in the detailed account of this consecration given in ch. 8 nor in the directions contained in Exodus 29 is there any reference to the offering enjoined in <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-21.htm" title="In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat offering shall you offer for a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:21</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note on <span class="ital"><a href="/context/leviticus/6-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 6:19-23</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to Jewish practice in the second temple, the high priest offered a <span class="ital">minḥah</span> every day during his tenure of office (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/45-14.htm" title="Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twice continually.">Sir 45:14</a>) at his own expense (Jos. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> iii. 10. 7). He brought the whole tenth part in the morning and divided it into two portions for the morning and evening. If the high priest after offering the morning portion were to die the remaining evening portion was not to be offered, but a fresh whole tenth part was to be brought, from which the half for the evening was taken, and the two unused halves were to be destroyed (Tal. Bab. <span class="ital">Menaḥoth</span> 50 <span class="ital">b</span>). This offering of the high priest was regarded as made, not on his behalf alone, but for himself and the priesthood. It was called <span class="ital">minḥath ḥǎbittîm</span>, ‘the minchah of baked pieces.’ The word <span class="ital">ḥǎbittîm</span> occurs once in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-31.htm" title="And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.">1 Chronicles 9:31</a>, and is from the same root as <span class="ital">maḥǎbath</span>, the ‘baking pan’ of <a href="/leviticus/2-5.htm" title="And if your oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.">Leviticus 2:5</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-21.htm" title="In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat offering shall you offer for a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:21</a> [Heb. 14], and <a href="/leviticus/7-9.htm" title="And all the meat offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying pan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offers it.">Leviticus 7:9</a>, used for the Meal-Offering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beside this daily offering of the high priest, every priest, at the commencement of his ministry, used to offer a Meal-Offering like that of the high priest, but instead of dividing it into two parts, to be offered in the morning and in the evening, it was offered all at one time. This oblation was called <span class="ital">minḥath ḥinnûḳ</span>, ‘meal offering of initiation.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the present state of the text, reference is made to two offerings:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1)&emsp;&emsp;An offering to be brought by Moses (cp. <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-21.htm" title="In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat offering shall you offer for a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:21</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2)&emsp;&emsp;An offering to be brought by Aaron’s successors in the high priestly office (<span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-22.htm" title="And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever to the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.">Leviticus 6:22</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If two such offerings are enjoined, it seems probable that some further discrimination between them would have been made. Two suggestions may be offered, each involving a slight modification of the text:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) The introductory sentence in <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-19.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 6:19</a></span> may have contained the additional clause ‘Speak unto’ or ‘Command Aaron and his sons, saying,’ as in <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-9.htm" title="Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning on the altar all night to the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.">Leviticus 6:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.">Leviticus 6:25</a></span>. The instructions in <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-21.htm" title="In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat offering shall you offer for a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:21</a></span> would then be addressed to Aaron, and the change of person in the verbs, though abrupt, is not without parallels in other parts of the legislation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The verbs in <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-21.htm" title="In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, you shall bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat offering shall you offer for a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:21</a></span> may have been originally in the third person, and the verse would then refer to an offering by Aaron.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In either case, the whole passage would be interpreted with reference to an offering brought by Aaron and his successors, such as that described in Josephus and in the Mishna. Whether in <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-22.htm" title="And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever to the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.">Leviticus 6:22</a></span> (the general rule about the Meal-Offering of the priest) there is any reference to the <span class="ital">minḥath ḥinnûḳ</span> is a question to which no definite answer can be given.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The difficulty raised by the words ‘in the day when he is anointed’ (see note introducing these four verses) is increased if the text be amended as suggested above. It is very doubtful whether these words can be considered as equivalent to ‘at the commencement of his ministry,’ and even if such an interpretation (admitted by some commentators) be allowed, the account of Aaron’s first sacrifices as recorded in ch. 9 makes no mention of an offering such as that here described. Moreover the words imply an offering brought <span class="ital">once</span> rather than <span class="ital">perpetually</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/6-20.htm" title="This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.">Leviticus 6:20</a></span> and see note there). Most modern commentators reject the words, considering them as a later gloss, and inconsistent with the description of the offering as perpetual. Some who retain them interpret ‘in the day when’ as ‘from the time that,’ i.e. in the day when and after.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-23.</span> - The meat offering of the high priest at his institution. This was to be not of uncooked flour, but in the form of a pancake, made out of one-tenth of an ephah of flour. It, of course, accompanied the burnt offering appointed for the occasion. <span class="cmt_word">Half of it</span> was burnt <span class="cmt_word">in the morning</span>, that is, at the morning sacrifice, <span class="cmt_word">and half thereof at night</span>, that is, the other half at the evening sacrifice, none being reserved for consumption by the priests. This meat offering, having first been offered at the consecration of Aaron, was afterwards to be offered at the consecration of each succeeding high priest, the expression <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and his sons</span> meaning here the successive high priests. The statement that the offering is to be <span class="cmt_word">perpetual</span>, has led to the belief that it was made every day by the high priest, from the time of his consecration onwards, and there is thought to be an allusion to this sacrifice in Ecclus. 45:14; but the more probable opinion is that it was only made on the day of consecration, that is, on the first day that he was qualified to act as high priest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Fire was to be kept constantly burning upon the altar without going out, not in order that the heavenly fire, which proceeded from Jehovah when Aaron and his sons first entered upon the service of the altar after their consecration, and consumed the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, might never be extinguished (see at <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>); but that the burnt-offering might never go out, because this was the divinely appointed symbol and visible sign of the uninterrupted worship of Jehovah, which the covenant nation could never suspend either day or night, without being unfaithful to its calling. For the same reason other nations also kept perpetual fire burning upon the altars of their principal gods. (For proofs, see Rosenmller and Knobel ad h. l.) </body></html>
