The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491; is wanting in the first clause, and only introduced in the second; but it belongs to the first clause as well. The pronoun &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; at the opening of the sentence cannot stand for the verb to be in the imperative. The passages, which Knobel adduces in support of this, are of a totally different kind. The instructions apply primarily to the burnt-offering, which was offered every evening, and furnished the basis for all the burnt-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-39</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3-4</a>).</body></html>
