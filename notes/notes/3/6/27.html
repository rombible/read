The vessel in which the flesh of the sin-offering was boiled must be broken, if it were an earthen one; but if a brazen one, well washed. This showed that the defilement was not wholly taken away by the offering; but the blood of Christ thoroughly cleanses from all sin. All these rules set forth the polluting nature of sin, and the removal of guilt from the sinner to the sacrifice. Behold and wonder at Christ's love, in that he was content to be made a sin-offering for us, and so to procure our pardon for continual sins and failings. He that knew no sin was made sin (that is, a sin-offering) for us, 2Co 5:21. Hence we have pardon, and not only pardon, but power also, against sin, Ro 8:3.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The place where ... - See <a href="/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>.<p>It is most holy - See <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>. The key to the special sanctity of the flesh of the sin-offering, as set forth in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26-30</a>, must, it would seem, be found in the words of Moses to the priests <a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>. The flesh of the victim, which represented the sinner for whom atonement was now made, was to be solemnly, and most exclusively, appropriated by those who were appointed to mediate between the sinner and the Lord. The far-reaching symbolism of the act met its perfect fulfillment in the One Mediator who took our nature upon Himself. <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25-28. This is the law of the sin offering&#8212;It was slain, and the fat and inwards, after being washed and salted, were burnt upon the altar. But the rest of the carcass belonged to the officiating priest. He and his family might feast upon it&#8212;only, however, within the precincts of the tabernacle; and none else were allowed to partake of it but the members of a priestly family&#8212;and not even they, if under any ceremonial defilement. The flesh on all occasions was boiled or sodden, with the exception of the paschal lamb, which was roasted [Ex 12:8, 9]; and if an earthen vessel had been used, it being porous and likely to imbibe some of the liquid particles, it was to be broken; if a metallic pan had been used it was to be scoured and washed with the greatest care, not because the vessels had been defiled, but the reverse&#8212;because the flesh of the sin offering having been boiled in them, those vessels were now too sacred for ordinary use. The design of all these minute ceremonies was to impress the minds, both of priests and people, with a sense of the evil nature of sin and the care they should take to prevent the least taint of its impurities clinging to them.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whatsoever shall touch the flesh; </span> of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it.

None but holy persons, such as were devoted to holy services, even the priests and their sons, might touch and eat of the flesh of the sin offering: all that did so were sacred persons; and even what were used in eating it, dishes and knives, were to be put to no other use, not to any common service, or for anything but holy things; which was done to keep up a veneration for the sacrifices, and especially for the great sacrifice they typified, the sacrifice of Christ, whose flesh is meat indeed; and whoever eats of that by faith dwells in Christ, and Christ dwells in him, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/6-55.htm">John 6:55</a>, <p>and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment; the garment of the priest that slays and offers it: <p>thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place; it was not to be carried out of the tabernacle, and washed elsewhere, but in the sanctuary; either at the laver, where the priests washed their hands and feet, or in some room in the court for that purpose.

In "the day of his anointing" (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;, construed as a passive with the accusative as in <a href="/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>), Aaron and his sons were to offer a corban as "a perpetual meat-offering" (minchah, in the absolute instead of the construct state: cf. <a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-6.htm">Numbers 28:6</a>; see Ges. 116, 6, Note b); and this was to be done in all future time by "the priest who was anointed of his sons in his stead," that is to say, by every high priest at the time of his consecration. "In the day of his anointing:" when the anointing was finished, the seven were designated as "the day," like the seven days of creation in <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>. This minchah was not offered during the seven days of the anointing itself, but after the consecration was finished, i.e., in all probability, as the Jewish tradition assumes, at the beginning of the eighth day, when the high priest entered upon his office, viz., along with the daily morning sacrifices (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-39</a>), and before the offering described in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9.htm">Leviticus 9</a>. It then continued to be offered, as "a perpetual minchah," every morning and evening during the whole term of his office, according to the testimony of the book of Wis. (45:14, where we cannot suppose the daily burnt-offering to be intended) and also of Josephus (Ant. 3:10, 7).<p>(Note: Vid., Lundius, jd. Heiligthmer, B. 3, c 9, 17 and 19; Thalhofer ut supra, p. 139; and Delitzsch on the Epistle to the Hebrews. The text evidently enjoins the offering of this minchah upon Aaron alone; for though Aaron and his sons are mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>, as they were consecrated together, in <a href="/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15</a> the priest anointed of his sons in Aaron's stead, i.e., the successor of Aaron in the high-priesthood, is commanded to offer it. Consequently the view maintained by Maimonides, Abarbanel, and others, which did not become general even among the Rabbins, viz., that every ordinary priest was required to offer this meat-offering when entering upon his office, has no solid foundation in the law (see Selden de success. in pontif. ii. c. 9; L' Empereur ad Middoth 1, 4, Not. 8; and Thalhofer, p. 150).)<p>It was to consist of the tenth of an ephah of fine flour, one half of which was to be presented in the morning, the other in the evening; - not as flour, however, but made in a pan with oil, "roasted" and &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514; &#1504;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; ("broken pieces of a minchah of crumbs"), i.e., in broken pieces, like a minchah composed of crumbs. &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; (<a href="/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/23-29.htm">1 Chronicles 23:29</a>) is no doubt synonymous with &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; &#1505;&#1500;&#1514;, and to be understood as denoting fine flour sufficiently burned or roasted in oil; the meaning mixed or mingled does not harmonise with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>, where the mixing or kneading with oil is expressed by &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;. The hapax legomenon &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; signifies either broken or baked, according as we suppose the word to be derived from the Arabic 'afana diminuit, or, as Gesenius and the Rabbins do, from &#1488;&#1508;&#1492; to bake, a point which can hardly be decided with certainty. This minchah, which was also instituted as a perpetual ordinance, was to be burnt entirely upon the altar, like every meat-offering presented by a priest, because it belonged to the category of the burnt-offerings, and of these meat-offerings the offerer himself had no share (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>, <a href="/leviticus/2-10.htm">Leviticus 2:10</a>). Origen observes in his homil. iv. in Levit.: In caeteris quidem praeceptis pontifex in offerendis sacrificiis populo praebet officium, in hoc vero mandato quae propria sunt curat et quod ad se spectat exequitur. It is also to be observed that the high priest was to offer only a bloodless minchah for himself, and not a bleeding sacrifice, which would have pointed to expiation. As the sanctified of the Lord, he was to draw near to the Lord every day with a sacrificial gift, which shadowed forth the fruits of sanctification. </body></html>
