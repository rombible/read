During the second Temple the following practice obtained. The high priest brought the whole tenth part of flour every morning. After sanctifying the whole, he divided it into halves with the measure kept in the sanctuary. He likewise brought three logs of oil, which he mingled with the flour, and kneaded six cakes of each half. After baking the cakes a little, he fried them upon the pan with some of the oil, taking care not to bake them too much, but that they should be between baked and raw, in accordance with the expression, <span class= "ital">tuphinei, </span>which the authorities of those days explained in this manner but which is rendered here in the Authorised Version by <span class= "ital">baked, </span>and by us <span class= "ital">roasted cakes. </span>Hereupon the high priest divided the six cakes into twelve cakes being the same number as those of the shewbread, and offered six subdivided in two in the morning and six in the evening.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/leviticus/6-20.htm" title="This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night....">Leviticus 6:20-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he is anointed — </span>To be high-priest; for he only of all the priests was to be anointed in future ages.

Jarchi says of this, that it was the common meat offering at the consecration of a priest, but the high priest offered it every day; and it appears from the Misnic writers (q) that this meat offering consisted of twelve cakes, the same number as those of the shewbread; the same phrase, a "perpetual statute", being used of one as the other; and six of these were offered in the morning, and six at evening; and this as the daily sacrifice had the same mystical meaning, and respected the continual efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ. <p>(p) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 10. sect. 7.

The priests were to eat this as unleavened, i.e., to bake it without leaven, and to eat it in a holy place, viz., in the court of the tabernacle. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a> is explained by "it shall not be baken with leaven" in <a href="/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17</a>. It was the priests' share of the firings of Jehovah (see <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>), and as such it was most holy (see <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), like the sin-offering and trespass-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>), and only to be eaten by the male members of the families of the priests. This was to be maintained as a statute for ever (see at <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>). Every one that touches them (the most holy offerings) becomes holy." &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean he shall be holy, or shall sanctify himself (lxx, Vulg., Luth., a Lap., etc.), nor he is consecrated to the sanctuary and is to perform service there (Theodor., Knobel, and others). In this provision, which was equally applicable to the sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/6-27.htm">Leviticus 6:27</a>), to the altar of the burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>), and to the most holy vessels of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>), the word is not to be interpreted by <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2-3</a>, or <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>, or by the expression "shall be holy" in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-10.htm">Leviticus 27:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>, but by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a>, "touch me not, for I am holy." The idea is this, every layman who touched these most holy things became holy through the contact, so that henceforth he had to guard against defilement in the same manner as the sanctified priests (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), though without sharing the priestly rights and prerogatives. This necessarily placed him in a position which would involve many inconveniences in connection with ordinary life. </body></html>
