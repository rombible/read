With oil olive, as the Targum of Jonathan; the pan in which it was made was a vessel that had no covering, nor hollow in the middle, nor any lip or edge, but was a plane, and extended, and the dough made on it was hard and stiff, that it might not run off (r). In the temple was a chamber of those that made the cakes (s), where, as Bartenora (t) observes, was prepared the meat offering, which the high priest offered, one half in the morning, and the other half in the evening: <p>and when it is baked, thou shalt bring it in; not thoroughly baked, but very little, as says Josephus, hastily, so that it swells, and rises up in bubbles. Jarchi says, the flour was first mixed in hot water, and after that it was baked in an oven, and then fried in a pan: <p>and the baked pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the Lord; or the meat offering cut in pieces shalt thou offer, as both the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem; the twelve cakes were broken each into two, and twelve halves were offered in the morning, and twelve at evening: the manner in which it was done was, the priest divided every cake into two by measure, so that he might offer half in the morning, and half in the evening; and he took the halves and doubled everyone of them into two, and broke them, until he found every broken piece doubled into two, and he offered the halves with half the handful of frankincense in the morning, and in like manner in the evening (u): this may have respect to the body of Christ being broken for us, whereby he became fit food for faith, and an offering of a sweet smelling savour to God. <p>(r) Misn.

The first word is uncertain, and is left blank. The Oxf. Lex. suggests, with a slight change of letters and vocalisation, to render ‘<span class="ital">thou shalt break</span>’ (it into a Meal-Offering of pieces and offer etc.), thus making the word a verb, and the root from which the following substantive ‘pieces’ is formed. If the description of Josephus and the Mishna (see additional note) be accepted as determining the meaning, then the word (? slightly amended) might be translated ‘baken pieces.’ The word is in appearance similar to that immediately preceding; perhaps it should be omitted as due to a scribal error. That the offering is baked is already indicated in the first part of the verse.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Law of the Meat-Offering. - The regulations in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15</a>, are merely a repetition of <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a> and <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; but in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16-18</a> the new instructions are introduced with regard to what was left and had not been burned upon the altar. The priests were to eat this as unleavened, i.e., to bake it without leaven, and to eat it in a holy place, viz., in the court of the tabernacle. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a> is explained by "it shall not be baken with leaven" in <a href="/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17</a>. It was the priests' share of the firings of Jehovah (see <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>), and as such it was most holy (see <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), like the sin-offering and trespass-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>), and only to be eaten by the male members of the families of the priests. This was to be maintained as a statute for ever (see at <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>). Every one that touches them (the most holy offerings) becomes holy." &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean he shall be holy, or shall sanctify himself (lxx, Vulg., Luth., a Lap., etc.), nor he is consecrated to the sanctuary and is to perform service there (Theodor., Knobel, and others). In this provision, which was equally applicable to the sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/6-27.htm">Leviticus 6:27</a>), to the altar of the burnt-offering (<a href="/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a>), and to the most holy vessels of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a>), the word is not to be interpreted by <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2-3</a>, or <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>, or by the expression "shall be holy" in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-10.htm">Leviticus 27:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>, but by <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a>, "touch me not, for I am holy." The idea is this, every layman who touched these most holy things became holy through the contact, so that henceforth he had to guard against defilement in the same manner as the sanctified priests (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), though without sharing the priestly rights and prerogatives. This necessarily placed him in a position which would involve many inconveniences in connection with ordinary life. </body></html>
