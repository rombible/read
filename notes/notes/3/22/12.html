Her bread came from her husband, and she could therefore no longer partake of the priest’s bread. During the second Temple the term “stranger” in this verse was also interpreted to include a man who ought to be a stranger to her, and hence it was enacted that if the priest’s daughter had gone astray with a stranger (see <a href="/leviticus/21-7.htm" title="They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.">Leviticus 21:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm" title="And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.">Leviticus 21:9</a>), she is for ever forbidden to eat of the holy food.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/22-12.htm" title="If the priest's daughter also be married to a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.">Leviticus 22:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">If the priest’s daughter be married to a stranger — </span>To one of another family, who is no priest.

Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A stranger - One of another family. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Le 22:10-16. Who of the Priests' House May Eat of Them.<p>10-13. There shall no stranger eat the holy thing&#8212;The portion of the sacrifices assigned for the support of the officiating priests was restricted to the exclusive use of his own family. A temporary guest or a hired servant was not at liberty to eat of them; but an exception was made in favor of a bought or homeborn slave, because such was a stated member of his household. On the same principle, his own daughter, who married a husband not a priest, could not eat of them. However, if a widow and childless, she was reinstated in the privileges of her father's house as before her marriage. But if she had become a mother, as her children had no right to the privileges of the priesthood, she was under a necessity of finding support for them elsewhere than under her father's roof.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto a stranger, </span> i.e. to one of another family, who is no priest.
