Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Speak ... that they so abstain from touching the holy things (i. e. the sacrificial food of all kinds) of the children of Israel which they consecrate unto me, that they profane not my holy name."

Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things&#8212;"To separate" means, in the language of the Mosaic ritual, "to abstain"; and therefore the import of this injunction is that the priests should abstain from eating that part of the sacrifices which, though belonging to their order, was to be partaken of only by such of them as were free from legal impurities.<p>that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me, &c.&#8212;that is, let them not, by their want of due reverence, give occasion to profane my holy name.

The priests; the children of Israel or the common people are not mentioned, as having no concern in the following laws about eating holy things: <p>that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel; both from offering their lawful sacrifices, which was the business of their office when pure, and chiefly from eating that part of them which was their due, and was allowed them; neither of these they were to do, particularly the latter, when they were in any uncleanness, as the following words show: <p>and that, they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me; which the children of Israel set apart and devoted to his service; which they would do, by eating their part of them when unclean, and thereby show little reverence to that holy name to which they were devoted; or which the priests themselves sanctified, by offering them to him; for Jarchi says, this takes in the holiness of the priests themselves; but the former seems best, and is confirmed in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-3.htm">Leviticus 22:3</a>, <p>I am the Lord; who is holy himself, and whose holy things these are, and will be sanctified by those that draw nigh unto him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name <i>in those things</i> which they hallow unto me: I <i>am</i> the LORD.</span><p>(a) Meaning, that the priests abstain from eating, as long as they are polluted.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">separate</span>] not of course in the full sense of the word.
