Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stranger - One of another family.

There shall no stranger eat the holy thing&#8212;The portion of the sacrifices assigned for the support of the officiating priests was restricted to the exclusive use of his own family. A temporary guest or a hired servant was not at liberty to eat of them; but an exception was made in favor of a bought or homeborn slave, because such was a stated member of his household. On the same principle, his own daughter, who married a husband not a priest, could not eat of them. However, if a widow and childless, she was reinstated in the privileges of her father's house as before her marriage. But if she had become a mother, as her children had no right to the privileges of the priesthood, she was under a necessity of finding support for them elsewhere than under her father's roof.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">No stranger, </span> i.e. of a strange family, who is not a priest, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/22-12.htm" title="If the priest's daughter also be married to a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.">Leviticus 22:12</a></span>: compare <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/matthew/12-4.htm" title="How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?">Matthew 12:4</a></span>.

The answer is, the priest's family. The members of the priest's family here specified are those only about whom any question might have arisen, namely, the slaves, who, as bring incorporated into the priest's household, have a right of eating of the priestly food not enjoyed by lodgers in his house or by servants hired with his money; and married daughters who have returned to their father's roof in consequence of the death of their husband, or of being divorced, without any children of their own. Under these circumstances, it is ruled that they become once more a part of the priest's family, and able to exercise the privileges of that position. The priest's wife and sons and unmarried daughters are not here mentioned, as no question arose about them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>No leper was to touch them (see <a href="/leviticus/13-2.htm">Leviticus 13:2</a>), or person with gonorrhaea (<a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>), until he was clean; no one who had touched a person defiled by a corpse (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>), or whose seed had gone from him (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/15-16.htm">Leviticus 15:16</a>, <a href="/leviticus/15-18.htm">Leviticus 15:18</a>); and no one who had touched an unclean creeping animal, or an unclean man. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-3.htm">Leviticus 5:3</a>, a closer definition of &#1500;&#1493; &#1497;&#1496;&#1502;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "who is unclean to him with regard to (on account of) any uncleanness which he may have."</body></html>
