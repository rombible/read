Let us recollect with gratitude that our great High Priest cannot be hindered by any thing from the discharge of his office. Let us also remember, that the Lord requires us to reverence his name, his truths, his ordinances, and commandments. Let us beware of hypocrisy, and examine ourselves concerning our sinful defilements, seeking to be purified from them in the blood of Christ, and by his sanctifying Spirit. Whoever attempts to expiate his own sin, or draws near in the pride of self-righteousness, puts as great an affront on Christ, as he who comes to the Lord's table from the gratification of sinful lusts. Nor can the minister who loves the souls of the people, suffer them to continue in this dangerous delusion. He must call upon them, not only to repent of their sins, and forsake them; but to put their whole trust in the atonement of Christ, by faith in his name, for pardon and acceptance with God; thus only will the Lord make them holy, as his own people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses are rather difficult.

We notice further that the classes of offerings dealt with differ, viz.

Thank-Offering (see <span class="ital"><a href="/leviticus/22-29.htm" title="And when you will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.">Leviticus 22:29</a></span>), included (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm" title="If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.">Leviticus 7:12</a>) under the genus Peace-Offering.
