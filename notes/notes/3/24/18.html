The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixed marriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made upon this occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to the strangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers, as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of the law, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty of this law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be in the heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of his mouth. If he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of what punishment will they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of the Son of God! Let us watch against anger, do no evil, avoid all connexions with wicked people, and reverence that holy name which sinners blaspheme.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stranger - i. e. foreigner.

The circumstances were the following: - The son of an Israelitish woman named Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan, and of an Egyptian whom the Israelitish woman had married, went out into the midst of the children of Israel, i.e., went out of his tent or place of encampment among the Israelites. As the son of an Egyptian, he belonged to the foreigners who had gone out with Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), and who probably had their tents somewhere apart from those of the Israelites, who were encamped according to their tribes (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>). Having got into a quarrel with an Israelite, this man scoffed at the name (of Jehovah) and cursed. The cause of the quarrel is not given, and cannot be determined. &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;: to bore, hollow out, then to sting, metaphorically to separate, fix (<a href="/genesis/30-28.htm">Genesis 30:28</a>), hence to designate (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17</a>, etc.), and to prick in malam partem, to taunt, i.e., to blaspheme, curse,  equals  &#1511;&#1489;&#1489; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-11.htm">Numbers 23:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25</a>, etc. That the word is used here in a bad sense, is evident from the expression "and cursed," and from the whole context of <a href="/leviticus/24-15.htm">Leviticus 24:15</a> and <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>. The Jews, on the other hand, have taken the word &#1504;&#1511;&#1489; in this passage from time immemorial in the sense of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (lxx), and founded upon it the well-known law, against even uttering the name Jehovah (see particularly <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). "The name" &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;. is the name "Jehovah" (cf. <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>), in which God manifested His nature. It was this passage that gave rise to the custom, so prevalent among the Rabbins, of using the expression "name," or "the name," for Dominus, or Deus (see Buxtorf, lex. talmud. pp. 2432ff.). The blasphemer was brought before Moses and then put into confinement, "to determine for them (such blasphemers) according to the mouth (command) of Jehovah." &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;: to separate, distinguish, then to determine exactly, which is the sense both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-34.htm">Numbers 15:34</a>, where it occurs in a similar connection. </body></html>
