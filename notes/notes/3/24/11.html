Being vexed with the Divine enactments which excluded him from encamping in the tribe of his mother, he both cursed God who gave such law, and reviled the judges who pronounced judgment against him. The expression, “the Name,” which in after times was commonly used instead of the Ineffable Jehovah, has been substituted here for the Tetragrammaton by a transcriber who out of reverence would not combine cursing with it. The same shyness on the part of copyists has been the cause of inserting the word Lord (<span class= "ital">Adonaī</span>) and God (<span class= "ital">Elohīm</span>) for Jehovah in sundry passages of the Old Testament. During the second Temple, however, this passage was rendered, “<span class= "ital">he pronounced the Name </span>and cursed.” Hence it was enacted that the simple pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton was criminal. In accordance with the ancient interpretation, the Chaldee version translates this part of the verse, “And when they came out of the house of judgment, having been condemned, the son of the Israelitish woman pronounced and reviled the great and glorious name of manifestation which had been heard on Sinai, and he was defiant and annoying.”<p><span class= "bld">And they brought him unto Moses.</span>—The contention about his right to pitch his tent among the tribe to which his mother belonged being a minor point, came within the jurisdiction of the rulers, according to the advice of Jethro (<a href="/exodus/18-22.htm" title="And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.">Exodus 18:22</a>); whilst blaspheming God was considered too serious an offence, and hence the criminal was brought to Moses.<p><span class= "bld">And his mother’s name was Shelomith.</span>—Whether we accept the traditional explanation, that Shelomith was no consenting party to her union with the Egyptian, or whether we regard her as having voluntarily married him, the fact that both her personal and tribal names are here so distinctly specified, indicates that the record of this incident is designed to point out the ungodly issue of so unholy an alliance, and to guard the Hebrew women against intermarriage with heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/24-11.htm" title="And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed.

The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixed marriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made upon this occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to the strangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers, as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of the law, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty of this law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be in the heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of his mouth. If he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of what punishment will they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of the Son of God!

But the Jews, taking the word in its more general sense, understood the passage as forbidding the mention of the Sacred Name, and wherever it occurs in the Scriptures they either pronounced it Adônai instead (rendered in English by ‘the Lord’), or, where the word Adônai was itself in immediate juxtaposition with the Sacred Name, they substituted for the latter Elôhîm.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - In the course of the straggle <span class="cmt_word">the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name</span> of the Lord, <span class="cmt_word">and cursed</span>. The word <span class="accented">nakav</span> is here rightly translated <span class="accented">blasphemeth</span> (cf. verses 14, 16, 23), but the words <span class="accented">of the Lord</span> should be omitted, as they are not found in the original, and are not required. The LXX. have rendered <span class="accented">nakav</span> by a word meaning <span class="accented">pronounced</span>, and on this misunderstanding, adopted by the Jews, has been founded the Jewish precept forbidding the utterance of the Divine Name. Owing to that prohibition, the true pronunciation of the word written and called "Jehovah" has been lost. Wherever the Name occurred in Scripture, that of <span class="accented">Adoring</span>, meaning <span class="accented">Lord</span>, was substituted for it in public reading, the consonants only of the original name, Y H V H, being preserved in the written text, and the vowels of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, namely a o a, being written underneath them in lieu of the original vowels. From the consonants Y H Y H and the vowels a o a would be formed Yahovah or Jahovah, but the laws of the Hebrew language required the first a to be changed into e, and hence the name Jehovah. It is almost certain that the original vowels were a and e, which would form the name Yahveh, the Samaritans having always so pronounced it, according to the testimony of Theodoret. It is said that the high priest continued to utter the very name Yahveh on the Day of Atonement long after it had ceased to be used in the reading of the Scriptures, and that when he did so, those who heard it prostrated themselves, saying, "Blessed be the Name!" After a time, however, he ceased to pronounce it aloud on that day also, lest it should be learnt and used for magical purposes. In consequence, perhaps, of the substitution of <span class="accented">Adonai</span> for <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>, the Septuagint version always reads for Yahveh, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: and the English version <span class="accented">the</span> LORD. In French and other versions the name is represented by <span class="accented">the Eternal</span>, and it has been proposed to substitute the latter rendering for <span class="accented">the</span> Loud in our own version. But it is more than doubtful whether we should then come nearer to the true sense of the original Yahveh, although at first sight it appears that this would be the case. For the word Yahveh is part of the causative form of the verb <span class="accented">havah</span>, or <span class="accented">hayah, to</span> be; but this verb is not used to express unchangeable or absolute existence, but rather an occurrence: its causative form, therefore, would signify that which brings about events; and the substantive derived from that causative form would signify, not one that eternally exists, but one that providentially governs. For an induction of instances for the further proof of the above meaning of the word Yahveh, we refer the reader to Sir William Martin's essay 'On the Divine Name' ('Semitic Languages,' part 2), from which we transcribe the concluding paragraph. "This view of the Divine Name, to which we are led by the evidence of the Hebrew language itself, is in full conformity with the general religious teaching of the Old Testament, which is practical and moral; setting forth in form readily intelligible, the character of God in his relations to man. It does not concern itself with those problems which philosophy has ever been seeking to solve. It addresses itself to human needs and human duties, and not to abstract inquiries. Not that the highest abstract truths were unknown or untaught. Lawgiver and prophet and psalmist set before the people the greatness and the eternity of God in language most clear and impressive. Yet the Name whereby he was put before them as the object of their daily worship, was not one which would exalt him to the utmost above the frail and changeful and transitory lives of his worshippers, and thereby remove him far away from them into the height of a Being beyond man's search or comprehension; but rather a Name which should bring him nigh to them, as One ever mindful of them, ever carrying forward his great purpose for their good, working for their deliverance in every time of need; as One 'whose providence ordereth all things in heaven and on earth.' If this Name did convey to the mind of a Hebrew hearer the thought above expressed, it follows that the old rendering <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">Lord</span>, is to be preferred to that which has of late been substituted for it." <span class="cmt_word">And they brought</span> the blasphemer unto Moses. This was in accordance with the counsel of Jethro, accepted by Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>): "Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge:...  and they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The preparation of the shew-bread and the use to be made of it are described here for the first time; though it had already been offered by the congregation at the consecration of the tabernacle, and placed by Moses upon the table (<a href="/exodus/39-36.htm">Exodus 39:36</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a>). Twelve cakes (challoth, <a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>) were to be made of fine flour, of two-tenths of an ephah each, and placed in two rows, six in each row, upon the golden table before Jehovah (<a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>.). Pure incense was then to be added to each row, which was to be (to serve) as a memorial (Azcarah, see <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>), as a firing for Jehovah. &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; to give upon, to add to, does not force us to the conclusion that the incense was to be spread upon the cakes; but is easily reconcilable with the Jewish tradition (Josephus, Ant. iii. 10, 7; Mishnah, Menach. xi. 7, 8), that the incense was placed in golden saucers with each row of bread. The number twelve corresponded to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel. The arrangement of the loaves in rows of six each was in accordance with the shape of the table, just like the division of the names of the twelve tribes upon the two precious stones on Aaron's shoulder-dress (<a href="/exodus/28-10.htm">Exodus 28:10</a>). By the presentation or preparation of them from the fine flour presented by the congregation, and still more by the addition of incense, which was burned upon the altar every Sabbath on the removal of the loaves as azcarah, i.e., as a practical memento of the congregation before God, the laying out of these loaves assumed the form of a bloodless sacrifice, in which the congregation brought the fruit of its life and labour before the face of the Lord, and presented itself to its God as a nation diligent in sanctification to good works. If the shew-bread was a minchah, or meat-offering, and even a most holy one, which only the priests were allowed to eat in the holy place (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>, cf. <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9-10</a>), it must naturally have been unleavened, as the unanimous testimony of the Jewish tradition affirms it to have been. And if as a rule no meat-offering could be leavened, and of the loaves of first-fruits prepared for the feast of Pentecost, which were actually leavened, none was allowed to be placed upon the altar (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-10.htm">Leviticus 6:10</a>); still less could leavened bread be brought into the sanctuary before Jehovah. The only ground, therefore, on which Knobel can maintain that those loaves were leavened, is on the supposition that they were intended to represent the daily bread, which could no more fail in the house of Jehovah than in any other well-appointed house (see Bhr, Symbolik i. p. 410). The process of laying these loaves before Jehovah continually was to be "an everlasting covenant" (<a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>), i.e., a pledge or sign of the everlasting covenant, just as circumcision, as the covenant in the flesh, was to be an everlasting covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>). </body></html>
