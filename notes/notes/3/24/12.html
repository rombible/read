The notice of his parents shows the common ill effect of mixed marriages. A standing law for the stoning of blasphemers was made upon this occasion. Great stress is laid upon this law. It extends to the strangers among them, as well as to those born in the land. Strangers, as well as native Israelites, should be entitled to the benefit of the law, so as not to suffer wrong; and should be liable to the penalty of this law, in case they did wrong. If those who profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous judgments. What enmity against God must be in the heart of man, when blasphemies against God proceed out of his mouth. If he that despised Moses' law, died without mercy, of what punishment will they be worthy, who despise and abuse the gospel of the Son of God!

And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord&#8212;A youth of this half-blood, having quarrelled with an Israelite [Le 24:10], vented his rage in some horrid form of impiety. It was a common practice among the Egyptians to curse their idols when disappointed in obtaining the object of their petitions. The Egyptian mind of this youth thought the greatest insult to his opponent was to blaspheme the object of his religious reverence. He spoke disrespectfully of One who sustained the double character of the King as well as the God of the Hebrew people; as the offense was a new one, he was put in ward till the mind of the Lord was ascertained as to his disposal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For God had only said in general, <span class="ital">that he would not hold such guiltless</span>, i.e. he would punish them, but had not declared how he would have them punished by men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they put him in ward,....

Twelve cakes (challoth, <a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>) were to be made of fine flour, of two-tenths of an ephah each, and placed in two rows, six in each row, upon the golden table before Jehovah (<a href="/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>.). Pure incense was then to be added to each row, which was to be (to serve) as a memorial (Azcarah, see <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>), as a firing for Jehovah. &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; to give upon, to add to, does not force us to the conclusion that the incense was to be spread upon the cakes; but is easily reconcilable with the Jewish tradition (Josephus, Ant. iii. 10, 7; Mishnah, Menach. xi. 7, 8), that the incense was placed in golden saucers with each row of bread. The number twelve corresponded to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel. The arrangement of the loaves in rows of six each was in accordance with the shape of the table, just like the division of the names of the twelve tribes upon the two precious stones on Aaron's shoulder-dress (<a href="/exodus/28-10.htm">Exodus 28:10</a>). By the presentation or preparation of them from the fine flour presented by the congregation, and still more by the addition of incense, which was burned upon the altar every Sabbath on the removal of the loaves as azcarah, i.e., as a practical memento of the congregation before God, the laying out of these loaves assumed the form of a bloodless sacrifice, in which the congregation brought the fruit of its life and labour before the face of the Lord, and presented itself to its God as a nation diligent in sanctification to good works. If the shew-bread was a minchah, or meat-offering, and even a most holy one, which only the priests were allowed to eat in the holy place (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>, cf. <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9-10</a>), it must naturally have been unleavened, as the unanimous testimony of the Jewish tradition affirms it to have been. And if as a rule no meat-offering could be leavened, and of the loaves of first-fruits prepared for the feast of Pentecost, which were actually leavened, none was allowed to be placed upon the altar (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-10.htm">Leviticus 6:10</a>); still less could leavened bread be brought into the sanctuary before Jehovah. The only ground, therefore, on which Knobel can maintain that those loaves were leavened, is on the supposition that they were intended to represent the daily bread, which could no more fail in the house of Jehovah than in any other well-appointed house (see Bhr, Symbolik i. p. 410). The process of laying these loaves before Jehovah continually was to be "an everlasting covenant" (<a href="/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>), i.e., a pledge or sign of the everlasting covenant, just as circumcision, as the covenant in the flesh, was to be an everlasting covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-13.htm">Genesis 17:13</a>). </body></html>
