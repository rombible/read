No mention of male or female is here made, because this point is already stated in <a href="/leviticus/3-6.htm" title="And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering to the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.">Leviticus 3:6</a>. Unlike the burnt offering (<a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a>), the goat is here separated from the sheep because of the difference in the oblation, arising from the<p>broad tail of the sheep, which does not exist in the goat.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:6-17 Here is a law that they should eat neither fat nor blood. As for the fat, it means the fat of the inwards, the suet. The blood was forbidden for the same reason; because it was God's part of every sacrifice. God would not permit the blood that made atonement to be used as a common thing, Heb 10:29; nor will he allow us, though we have the comfort of the atonement made, to claim for ourselves any share in the honour of making it. This taught the Jews to observe distinction between common and sacred things; it kept them separate from idolaters. It would impress them more deeply with the belief of some important mystery in the shedding of the blood and the burning the fat of their solemn sacrifices. Christ, as the Prince of peace, made peace with the blood of his cross. Through him the believer is reconciled to God; and having the peace of God in his heart, he is disposed to follow peace with all men. May the Lord multiply grace, mercy, and peace, to all who desire to bear the Christian character.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a> note.

The fat tails which the sheep have in Northern Africa and Egypt, also in Arabia, especially Southern Arabia, and Syria, often weigh 15 lbs. or more, and small carriages on wheels are sometimes placed under them to bear their weight (Sonnini, R. ii. p. 358; Bochart, Hieroz. i. pp. 556ff.). It consists of something between marrow and fat. Ordinary sheep are also found in Arabia and Syria; but in modern Palestine all the sheep are "of the broad-tailed species." The broad part of the tail is an excresence of fat, from which the true tail hangs down (Robinson, Pal. ii. 166). "Near the rump-bone shall he (the offerer) take it (the fat tail) away," i.e., separate it from the body. &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., is, according to Saad., os caudae s. coccygis, i.e., the rump or tail-bone, which passes over into the vertebrae of the tail (cf. Bochart, i. pp. 560-1). In <a href="/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a> and <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a> the fat portions which were burned are called "food of the firing for Jehovah," or "food of the firing for a sweet savour," i.e., food which served as a firing for Jehovah, or reached Jehovah by being burned; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-24.htm">Numbers 28:24</a>, "food of the firing of a sweet savour for Jehovah." Hence not only are the daily burnt-offerings and the burnt and sin-offerings of the different feasts called "food of Jehovah" ("My bread," <a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2</a>); but the sacrifices generally are described as "the food of God" ("the bread of their God," <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-8.htm">Leviticus 21:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-21.htm">Leviticus 21:21-22</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/22-25.htm">Leviticus 22:25</a>), as food, that is, which Israel produced and caused to ascend to its God in fire as a sweet smelling savour. - Nothing is determined here with regard to the appropriation of the flesh of the peace-offerings, as their destination for a sacrificial meal was already known from traditional custom. The more minute directions for the meal itself are given in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-36</a>, where the meaning of these sacrifices is more fully explained. - In <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a> (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>) the general rule is added, "all fat belongs to Jehovah," and the law, "eat neither fat nor blood," is enforced as "an eternal statute" for the generations of Israel (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>) in all their dwelling-places (see <a href="/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-20.htm">Exodus 12:20</a>). </body></html>
