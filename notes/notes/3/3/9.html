As for the fat, it means the fat of the inwards, the suet. The blood was forbidden for the same reason; because it was God's part of every sacrifice. God would not permit the blood that made atonement to be used as a common thing, Heb 10:29; nor will he allow us, though we have the comfort of the atonement made, to claim for ourselves any share in the honour of making it. This taught the Jews to observe distinction between common and sacred things; it kept them separate from idolaters. It would impress them more deeply with the belief of some important mystery in the shedding of the blood and the burning the fat of their solemn sacrifices. Christ, as the Prince of peace, made peace with the blood of his cross. Through him the believer is reconciled to God; and having the peace of God in his heart, he is disposed to follow peace with all men.

These tails are of a substance between fat and marrow. A sheep of this kind weighs sixty or seventy English pounds weight, of which the tail usually weighs fifteen pounds and upwards. This species is by far the most numerous in Arabia, Syria, and Palestine, and, forming probably a large portion in the flocks of the Israelites, it seems to have been the kind that usually bled on the Jewish altars. The extraordinary size and deliciousness of their tails give additional importance to this law. To command by an express law the tail of a certain sheep to be offered in sacrifice to God, might well surprise us; but the wonder ceases, when we are told of those broad-tailed Eastern sheep, and of the extreme delicacy of that part which was so particularly specified in the statute [Paxton].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The fat thereof, and the whole rump, </span> which in sheep is fat and sweet, and in these parts was; cry much larger and better than ours, as is agreed both by ancient and modern writers, and therefore was fitly offered to God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering,....

Hence the clause, "on the kidneys (i.e., by them, as far as it reaches) shall he take it away." This smaller net is delicate, but not so fat as the larger net; though it still forms part of the fat portions. The word &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1514;, which only occurs in the passages quoted, is to be explained from the Arabic and Ethiopic (to stretch over, to stretch out), whence also the words &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; a cord (<a href="/judges/16-7.htm">Judges 16:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>), and &#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512; the bow-string (<a href="/psalms/21-13.htm">Psalm 21:13</a>) or extended tent-ropes (<a href="/exodus/35-18.htm">Exodus 35:18</a>), are derived.
