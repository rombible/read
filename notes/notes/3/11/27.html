As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br>]<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unclean - If the due purification was omitted at the time, through negligence or forgetfulness, a sin-offering was required.

To the birds there are appended flying animals of other kinds: "all swarms of fowl that go upon fours," i.e., the smaller winged animals with four feet, which are called sherez, "swarms," on account of their multitude. These were not to be eaten, as they were all abominations, with the exception of those "which have two shank-feet above their feet (i.e., springing feet) to leap with" (&#1500;&#1488; for &#1500;&#1493; as in <a href="/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>). Locusts are the animals referred to, four varieties being mentioned with their different species ("after his kind"); but these cannot be identified with exactness, as there is still a dearth of information as to the natural history of the oriental locust. It is well known that locusts were eaten by many of the nations of antiquity both in Asia and Africa, and even the ancient Greeks thought the Cicades very agreeable in flavour (Arist. h. an. 5, 30). In Arabia they are sold in the market, sometimes strung upon cords, sometimes by measure; and they are also dried, and kept in bags for winter use. For the most part, however, it is only by the poorer classes that they are eaten, and many of the tribes of Arabia abhor them (Robinson, ii. p. 628); and those who use them as food do not eat all the species indiscriminately. They are generally cooked over hot coals, or on a plate, or in an oven, or stewed in butter, and eaten either with salt or with spice and vinegar, the head, wings, and feet being thrown away. They are also boiled in salt and water, and eaten with salt or butter. Another process is to dry them thoroughly, and then grind them into meal and make cakes of them. The Israelites were allowed to eat the arbeh, i.e., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>, <a href="/exodus/10-19.htm">Exodus 10:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>, etc., the flying migratory locust, gryllus migratorius, which still bears this name, according to Niebuhr, in Maskat and Bagdad, and is poetically designated in <a href="/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>, as &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, the devourer, and &#1497;&#1500;&#1511;, the eater-up; but Knobel is mistaken in supposing that these names are applied to certain species of the arbeh. &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;&#1501;, according to the Chaldee, deglutivit, absorpsit, is unquestionably a larger and peculiarly voracious species of locust. This is all that can be inferred from the rashon of the Targums and Talmud, whilst the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; and attacus of the lxx and Vulg. are altogether unexplained. &#1495;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;: according to the Arabic, a galloping, i.e., a hopping, not a flying species of locust. This is supported by the Samaritan, also by the lxx and Vulg., &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, ophiomachus. According to Hesychius and Suidas, it was a species of locust without wings, probably a very large kind; as it is stated in Mishnah, Shabb. vi. 10, that an egg of the chargol was sometimes suspended in the ear, as a remedy for earache. Among the different species of locusts in Mesopotamia, Niebuhr (Arab. p. 170) saw two of a very large size with springing feet, but without wings. &#1495;&#1490;&#1489;, a word of uncertain etymology, occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>, where the spies are described as being like chagabim by the side of the inhabitants of the country, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13</a>, where the chagab devours the land. From these passages we may infer that it was a species of locust without wings, small but very numerous, probably the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, which is often mentioned along with the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, but as a distinct species, locustarum minima sine pennis (Plin. h. n. 29, c. 4, s. 29), or parva locusta modicis pennis reptans potius quam volitans semperque subsiliens (Jerome (on <a href="/nahum/3-17.htm">Nahum 3:17</a>).<p>(Note: In <a href="/deuteronomy/14-19.htm">Deuteronomy 14:19</a> the edible kinds of locusts are passed over, because it was not the intention of Moses to repeat every particular of the earlier laws in these addresses. But when Knobel (on Lev. pp. 455 and 461) gives this explanation of the omission, that the eating of locusts is prohibited in Deuteronomy, and the Deuteronomist passes them over because in his more advanced age there was apparently no longer any necessity for the prohibition, this arbitrary interpretation is proved to be at variance with historical truth by the fact that locusts were eaten by John the Baptist, inasmuch as this proves at all events that a more advanced age had not given up the custom of eating locusts.) </body></html>
