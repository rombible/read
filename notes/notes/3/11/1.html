Hence, when a question of defilement had afterwards to be decided, it was brought for judgment before Moses and Aaron conjointly.

As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br>]<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yahweh speaks to Moses and Aaron conjointly.

Beasts That May and May Not Be Eaten.<p>1, 2. the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron&#8212;These laws, being addressed to both the civil and ecclesiastical rulers in Israel, may serve to indicate the twofold view that is to be taken of them. Undoubtedly the first and strongest reason for instituting a distinction among meats was to discourage the Israelites from spreading into other countries, and from general intercourse with the world&#8212;to prevent them acquiring familiarity with the inhabitants of the countries bordering on Canaan, so as to fall into their idolatries or be contaminated with their vices: in short, to keep them a distinct and peculiar people. To this purpose, no difference of creed, no system of polity, no diversity of language or manner, was so subservient as a distinction of meats founded on religion; and hence the Jews, who were taught by education to abhor many articles of food freely partaken of by other people, never, even during periods of great degeneracy, could amalgamate with the nations among which they were dispersed. But although this was the principal foundation of these laws, dietetic reasons also had weight; for there is no doubt that the flesh of many of the animals here ranked as unclean, is everywhere, but especially in warm climates, less wholesome and adapted for food than those which were allowed to be eaten. These laws, therefore, being subservient to sanitary as well as religious ends, were addressed both to Moses and Aaron.From the laws concerning the priests, he now comes to those which belong to all the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beasts clean and unclean, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/leviticus/11-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,...">Leviticus 11:1-8</a></span>.

By the minchah in <a href="/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a> we are to understand the meal and oil, which were offered with the burnt-offering of the nation (<a href="/leviticus/9-4.htm">Leviticus 9:4</a> and <a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>); and by the &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>, those portions of the burnt-offering, meat-offering, and peace-offering of the nation which were burned upon the altar (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm">Leviticus 9:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/9-20.htm">Leviticus 9:20</a>). He then looked for "the he-goat of the sin-offering," - i.e., the flesh of the goat which had been brought for a sin-offering (<a href="/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), and which was to have been eaten by the priests in the holy place along with the sin-offerings, whose blood was not taken into the sanctuary (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-22.htm">Leviticus 6:22</a>); - "and, behold, it was burned" (&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507;,   3 perf. Pual). Moses was angry at this, and reproved Eleazar and Ithamar, who had attended to the burning: "Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in a holy place?" he said; "for it is most holy, and He (Jehovah) hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for it before Jehovah," as its blood had not been brought into the holy place (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; construed as a passive with an accusative, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>, etc.). "To bear the iniquity" does not signify here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, to bear and atone for the sin in its consequences, but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, to take the sin of another upon one's self, for the purpose of cancelling it, to make expiation for it. As, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>, the high priest was to appear before the Lord with the diadem upon his forehead, as the symbol of the holiness of his office, to cancel, as the mediator of the nation and by virtue of his official holiness, the sin which adhered to the holy gifts of the nation (see the note on this passage), so here it is stated with regard to the official eating of the most holy flesh of the sin-offering, which had been enjoined upon the priests, that they were thereby to bear the sin of the congregation, to make atonement for it. This effect or signification could only be ascribed to the eating, by its being regarded as an incorporation of the victim laden with sin, whereby the priests actually took away the sin by virtue of the holiness and sanctifying power belonging to their office, and not merely declared it removed, as Oehler explains the words (Herzog's Cycl. x. p. 649). <a href="/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> is decisive in opposition to the declaratory view, which does not embrace the meaning of the words, and is not applicable to the passage at all. "Incorporabant quasi peccatum populique reatum in se recipiebant" (Deyling observv. ss. i. 45, 2).<p>(Note: C. a Lapide has given this correct interpretation of the passage: "ut scilicet cum hostiis populi pro peccato simul etiam populi peccata in vos quasi recipiatis, ut illa expietis." There is no foundation for the objection offered by Oehler, that the actual removal of guilt and the atonement itself were effected by the offering of the blood. For it by no means follows from <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, that the blood, as the soul of the sacrificial animal, covered or expiated the soul of the sinner, and that the removal and extinction of the sin had already taken place with the covering of the soul before the holy God, which involved the forgiveness of the sin and the reception of the sinner to mercy.) </body></html>
