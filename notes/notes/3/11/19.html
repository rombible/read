or wings and feathers to the ostrich?">Job 39:13</a>, where the Authorised Version has “wing” in the text and “stork” in the margin. Its name literally denotes in Hebrew “the pious,” “the kind,” and is so called because the ancients regarded it as a type of maternal and filial affection and tenderness. The mother has been known to prefer perishing with its offspring in the flames rather than desert them when its attempts to rescue them from a fire had failed. The white stork is one of the largest land birds. Its black and powerful wings strikingly contrast with the pure white of its plumage. Hence the remark “they had wings like the wings of the stork” (<a href="/zechariah/5-9.htm" title="Then lifted I up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.">Zechariah 5:9</a>). The storks build on the loftiest towers and most conspicuous ruins, and also on the tops of high trees, where they may be seen to this day by the Sea of Galilee. It is to this that the Psalmist alludes: “as for the stork, the fir-trees are her home” (<a href="/psalms/104-17.htm" title="Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.">Psalm 104:17</a>). To these nests they regularly return at the proper season, which marks them as the most punctual of migratory birds; and it is to this feature in their nature that the prophet refers: “the stork in heaven knoweth her appointed times” (<a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm" title="Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:7</a>). The stork feeds on fish, reptiles, and all kinds of offal and garbage, for which reason it is here placed in the list of unclean birds.<p><span class= "bld">The heron.</span>—Whilst the two preceding birds are named after their good qualities, viz., “the merciful” and “the pious,” this bird, which only occurs again in the parallel passage in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-18.htm" title="And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.">Deuteronomy 14:18</a>, is termed (<span class= "ital">anaphah</span>) “the angry,” “the cruel,” which aptly describes the heron. It is allied to the stork, and is of such a savage nature that it will defend itself with its beak against the dogs after it has had its legs shot and broken. It resides on the banks of rivers and in marshy places, and feeds on fish, frogs, lizards, snails, field-mice, and all sorts of insects, for which reason it is here included in the proscribed list of unclean birds. It exists in a variety of species. Hence the adjunct, “after her kind.”<p><span class= "bld">And the lapwing.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">the hoopoe. </span>This dirty bird, which only occurs again in the parallel list in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-18.htm" title="And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.">Deuteronomy 14:18</a>, and which according to the ancients builds its nest of human dung, feeds upon offal and garbage. Its loathsome smell during brooding-time, and for weeks after, is perfectly insufferable. Though its flesh, which in the autumn tastes like quail’s, is eaten in some places, yet the Mohammedans regard it as proscribed. According to another ancient tradition the bird here meant is “the mountain cock.”<p><span class= "bld">And the bat.</span>—The list which opens with the eagle, the king of the birds, fitly concludes with the hybrid bat, the vilest creature, which is between a bird and a mouse, and is appropriately associated in the Bible with the mole as the type of darkness (comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm" title="In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;">Isaiah 2:20</a>). From the fact that the air is its home; that like the swallow, which it resembles in mode of flight, it wheels through the air in every direction in search of the crepuscular and nocturnal insects on which it preys; and that it performs the most abrupt and skilful evolutions in its aerial course, the bat was classed among the birds. Bats abound in Syria in a great variety of species. They penetrate into the houses and make the rooms most offensive to live in. Those who have realised the sickening odour of these creatures in the East will readily understand why the loathsome bats are included in the list of unclean birds. Some of the ancient nations ate bats and regarded them as delicious food. Besides being the lowest, the bat is here placed last, because it forms the connecting link between the volatile bipeds and quadrupeds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/11-19.htm" title="And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.">Leviticus 11:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">The bat — </span>Moses begins his catalogue of birds with the noblest, and ends it with the vilest, which is the bat, an animal of a dubious kind, between a bird and a mouse.

As a test of the people's obedience, as Adam was forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge; and to teach them self-denial, and the government of their appetites. 2. To keep the Israelites distinct from other nations. Many also of these forbidden animals were objects of superstition and idolatry to the heathen. 3. The people were taught to make distinctions between the holy and unholy in their companions and intimate connexions. 4. The law forbad, not only the eating of the unclean beasts, but the touching of them. Those who would be kept from any sin, must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, or coming near it. The exceptions are very minute, and all were designed to call forth constant care and exactness in their obedience; and to teach us to obey. Whilst we enjoy our Christian liberty, and are free from such burdensome observances, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty. For the Lord hath redeemed and called his people, that they may be holy, even as he is holy. We must come out, and be separate from the world; we must leave the company of the ungodly, and all needless connexions with those who are dead in sin; we must be zealous of good works devoted followers of God, and companions of his people.<br>]<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The heron ... the lapwing - Rather, the great plover the hoopoe, so called from its peculiar cry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. the stork&#8212;a bird of benevolent temper and held in the highest estimation in all Eastern countries; it was declared unclean, probably, from its feeding on serpents and other venomous reptiles, as well as rearing its young on the same food.<p>the heron&#8212;The word so translated only occurs in the prohibited list of food and has been variously rendered&#8212;the crane, the plover, the woodcock, the parrot.

A bird of passage, <a href="/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a> it has its name from kindness, which it exercises both to its dam, and to its young. Various writers (b) speak of the kindness of these birds to their dams, which when they are old they take care of and feed them, to which the apostle is thought to allude, <a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm">1 Timothy 5:4</a> and its tenderness to its young is no less manifest: when the city of Delf in Holland was on fire, the storks were seen very busy to save their young from the flames, and which when they could not do, threw themselves into the midst of them, and perished with them, as Drusius from the Dutch historians relates. It is said to feed upon serpents; and hence by Virgil (c) to be "invisa colubris"; and Juvenal (d) says, it nourishes its young with them; and which may be a reason of its being forbid to be eaten, and is the reason given by the Mahometans (e) for the prohibition of it; though on this account it was in great honour in Thessaly, that country being freed from serpents by it, and therefore they made it a capital crime to kill them, as Pliny (f) relates; formerly people would not eat the stork, but at present it is much esteemed for the deliciousness of its flesh (g). <p>the heron after her kind; this bird has its name in Hebrew from its being soon angry, as Aben Ezra observes; and Jarchi calls it the angry vulture or kite, as it is in the Talmud (h); and adds, and it appears to me to be what they call the "heron", one sort of which named "asterias", as there is one sort so called by Pliny (i); it becomes tame in Egypt, and so well understands the voice of a man, as Aelianus (k) reports, that if anyone by way of reproach calls it a servant or slothful, it is immediately exceeding angry. There are three kinds of herons, as both Aristotle (l) and Pliny (m); and by a learned man of ours (n), their names are thus given, the criel or dwarf heron, the blue heron, and the bittour; some reckon nineteen: <p>and the lapwing; the upupa or hoopoe; it has its name in Hebrew, according to Jarchi, from its having a double crest; and so Pliny (o) ascribes to it a double or folded crest, and speaks of it as a filthy bird; and, according to Aristotle (p) and Aelian (q), its nest is chiefly made of human dung, that by the ill smell of it men may be kept from taking its young; and therefore may well be reckoned among impure fowl. Calmet (r) says, there is no such thing as a lapwing to be seen in any part of England; but there are such as we call so, whether the same bird with this I cannot say: <p>and the bat; a little bird which flies in the night, Aben Ezra says; Kimchi (s) describes it a mouse with wings, which flies in the night, and we sometimes call it the "flitter mouse"; it is a creature between a fowl and a beast; and, as Aristotle says (t), it partakes of both, and is of neither; and it is the only fowl, as Pliny (u) observes, that has teeth and teats, that brings forth animals, and nourishes them with milk. It is a creature so very disagreeable, that one would think almost there was no need of a law to forbid the eating of it; and yet it is said by some to be eatable, and to be eaten, as Strabo (w) affirms, yea, to be delicious food. It is asserted (x), that there is a sort of them in the east, larger than ordinary, and is salted and eaten--that there are bats in China as large as pullets, and are as delicate eating. Of these several fowls before mentioned, some are of the ravenous kind, and are an emblem of persecutors and covetous persons, and such as live by rapine and violence; others are of a lustful nature, and are an emblem of those who serve various lusts and pleasures, and give up themselves to uncleanness; others are night birds, and are a proper emblem of them whose works are works of darkness, and love darkness rather than the light; and others never rise higher than the earth, and so may denote earthly minded persons; and others live on impure things, and so fitly represent such who live an impure life; with all such the people of God are to have no fellowship. <p>(b) Aristot.

The derivation of the Heb. word is uncertain, but its meaning is not questioned.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-11.htm">Deuteronomy 14:11-18</a>). Of birds, twenty varieties are prohibited, including the bat, but without any common mark being given; though they consist almost exclusively of birds which live upon flesh or carrion, and are most of them natives of Western Asia.<p>(Note: The list is "hardly intended to be exhaustive, but simply mentions those which were eaten by others, and in relation to which, therefore, it was necessary that the Israelites should receive a special prohibition against eating them" (Knobel). Hence in Deuteronomy Moses added the &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and enumerated twenty-one varieties; and on doubt, under other circumstances, he could have made the list still longer. In <a href="/deuteronomy/14-11.htm">Deuteronomy 14:11</a> &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; is used, as synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1507; in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-20.htm">Deuteronomy 14:20</a>.)<p>The list commences with the eagle, as the king of the birds. Nesher embraces all the species of eagles proper. The idea that the eagle will not touch carrion is erroneous. According to the testimony of Arabian writers (Damiri in Bochart, ii. p. 577), and several naturalists who have travelled (e.g., Forskal. l.c. p. 12, and Seetzen, 1, p. 379), they will eat carrion if it is still fresh and not decomposed; so that the eating of carrion could very properly be attributed to them in such passages as <a href="/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>, and <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. But the bald-headedness mentioned in <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a> applies, not to the true eagle, but to the carrion-kite, which is reckoned, however, among the different species of eagles, as well as the bearded or golden vulture. The next in the list is peres, from paras  equals  parash to break, ossifragus, i.e., wither the bearded or golden vulture, gypaetos barbatus, or more probably, as Schultz supposes, the sea-eagle, which may have been the species intended in the &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c8;  equals  &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of the lxx and gryphus of the Vulgate, and to which the ancients seem sometimes to have applied the name ossifraga (Lucret. v. 1079). By the next, &#1506;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, we are very probably to understand the bearded or golden vulture. For this word is no doubt connected with the Arabic word for beard, and therefore points to the golden vulture, which has a tuft of hair or feathers on the lower beak, and which might very well be associated with the eagles so far as the size is concerned, having wings that measure 10 feet from tip to tip. As it really belongs to the family of cultures, it forms a very fitting link of transition to the other species of vulture and falcon (<a href="/leviticus/11-14.htm">Leviticus 11:14</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; (Deut. &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, according to a change which is by no means rare when the aleph stands between two vowels: cf. &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;&#1490; in <a href="/1_samuel/21-8.htm">1 Samuel 21:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1490; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/22-22.htm">1 Samuel 22:22</a>), from &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; to fly, is either the kite, or the glede, which is very common in Palestine (v. Schubert, Reise iii. p. 120), and lives on carrion. It is a gregarious bird (cf. <a href="/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a>), which other birds of prey are not, and is used by many different tribes as food (Oedmann, iii. p. 120). The conjecture that the black glede-kite is meant, - a bird which is particularly common in the East, - and that the name is derived from &#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; to be dark, is overthrown by the use of the word &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; in Deuteronomy, which shows that &#1491;&#1488;&#1492; is intended to denote the whole genus. &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, which is referred to in <a href="/job/28-7.htm">Job 28:7</a> as sharp-sighted, is either the falcon, several species of which are natives of Syria and Arabia, and which is noted for its keen sight and the rapidity of its flight, or according to the Vulgate, Schultz, etc., vultur, the true vulture (the lxx have &#x399;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;, the kite, here, and &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c8;, the griffin, in Deut. and Job), of which there are three species in Palestine (Lynch, p. 229). In <a href="/deuteronomy/14-13.htm">Deuteronomy 14:13</a> &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is also mentioned, from &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; to see. Judging from the name, it was a keen-sighted bird, either a falcon or another species of vulture (Vulg. ixion). </body></html>
