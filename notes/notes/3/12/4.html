During these thirty-three days, which constituted the second stage, the mother was only debarred from touching holy things, such as first tithes, the flesh of thank- and peace-offerings, &c, and from entering the sanctuary. Having bathed at the end of the seven days which constituted the first and defiling period, she could now partake of the second tithes, and resume conjugal intercourse, since any blood that might now appear was regarded as <span class= "ital">pure blood, </span>in contradistinction to the (<span class= "ital">dam nidah</span>) blood of monthly courses. Her proximity, therefore, no longer defiled. The Sadducees and the Samaritans during the second Temple, and their followers, the Karaite Jews, interpreted this law more rigidly. Though admitting that there is a difference of degree in the two periods, they maintained that the woman was too unclean for conjugal intercourse even during the second period. They therefore pointed the text differently so as to yield the rendering “blood of <span class= "ital">her </span>purifying.” The Authorised Version, which, in this instance, follows the opinion of the Sadducees, departs from the received text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/12-4.htm" title="And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.">Leviticus 12:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the blood of her purifying — </span>In her polluted and separated estate; for the word <span class="ital">blood, </span>or <span class="ital">bloods, </span>signifies both guilt and uncleanness, as here and elsewhere.

The time of purification after the birth of a female was twice as long as that after a male. The belief that the birth of a girl was more dangerous for the mother than the birth of a boy prevailed among ancient nations, who considered that hostile supernatural beings were more to be feared in these cases. The practice, at here, survived the belief on which it was founded.
