The circumcision of a male child on the eighth day was religiously observed, and even was not omitted on account of the sabbath, when the eighth day happened to be on that; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm">John 7:22</a>, <a href="/john/7-23.htm">John 7:23</a>. It is an observation of Aben Ezra on this place, that the wise men say "in the day", and not in the night, lo, he that is born half an hour before the setting of the sun is circumcised after six days and a half, for the day of the law is not from time to time. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Lastly, contact with edible animals, if they had not been slaughtered, but had died a natural death, and had become carrion in consequence, is also said to defile (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39</a>, <a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24-28</a>).
