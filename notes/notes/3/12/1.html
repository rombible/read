The laws of defilement contracted from without by eating or coming in contact with unclean objects are naturally followed by precepts about defilement arising from within the human body itself. The spiritual guides in the time of Christ, however, account for the sequence of these laws by declaring that the arrangement follows the order of the Creation, Just as at the Creation God made the animals first, and then formed man, so in the laws of purity the animals take the precedence of man, and are treated of first.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 12:1</a></span>.

The laws in the preceding chapter were delivered both to Moses and Aaron, but what follows in this only to Moses; but inasmuch as the priest had a concern in it, it being his business to offer the sacrifices required by the following law, it was no doubt given to Moses, to be delivered to Aaron, as well as to the people. R. Semlai remarks, that as the creation of man was after that of the beasts, fowls, fishes, &amp;c. so the laws concerning the uncleanness of men are after those relating to beasts, &amp;c, and they begin with the uncleanness of a new mother, because, as Aben Ezra observes, the birth is the beginning of man: <p>saying: as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. These precepts are addressed to Moses only.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As there is a natural disgust felt for some kinds of food, which serves as a foundation for the precepts of the last chapter, so there is an instinct which regards some of the concomitants of childbirth, and some diseases, as foul and defiling. In accordance with these instincts, purifying rites are commanded for the restoration of those affected to ceremonial cleanness. These instincts and consequent regulations respecting women in childbirth are found in very many different nations. "The Hindoo law pronounced the mother of a newborn child to be impure for forty days, required the father to bathe as soon as the birth had taken place, and debarred the whole family for a period from religious rites, while they were 'to confine themselves to an inward remembrance of the Deity;' in a Brahmin family this rule extended to all relations within the fourth degree, for ten days, at the end of which they had to bathe. According to the Parsee law, the mother and child were bathed, and the mother had to live in seclusion for forty days, after which she had to undergo other purifying rites. The Arabs are said by Burekhardt to regard the mother as unclean for forty days. The ancient Greeks suffered neither childbirth nor death to take place within consecrated places; both mother and child were bathed, and the mother was not allowed to approach an altar for forty days. The term of forty days, it is evident, was generally regarded as a critical one for both the mother and the child. The day on which the Romans gave the name to the child - the eighth day for a girl, and the ninth for a boy - was called <span class="accented">lustrieus dies</span>, 'the day of purification,' because certain lustral rites in behalf of the child were performed on the occasion, and some sort of offering was made. The <span class="accented">amphidromia</span> of the Greeks was a similar lustration for the child, when the name was given, probably between the seventh and tenth days" (Clark). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Lastly, contact with edible animals, if they had not been slaughtered, but had died a natural death, and had become carrion in consequence, is also said to defile (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39</a>, <a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24-28</a>).
