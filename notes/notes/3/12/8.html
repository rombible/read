It was therefore the poor woman’s sacrifice which the mother of our Lord offered, when, in accordance with this commutation, she offered a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons, on presenting herself for purification at the Temple with the child Jesus, on the expiration of the prescribed term of uncleanness (<a href="/luke/2-24.htm" title="And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.">Luke 2:24</a>), and the priest, after sprinkling her with the blood of the humble sacrifice, declared her cleansed.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/12-8.htm" title="And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.">Leviticus 12:8</a></span>.
