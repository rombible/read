Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>More literally: All the days of its desolation shall it rest that time which it rested not in your Sabbaths while ye dwelt upon it.

Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, &c.&#8212;A long arrear of sabbatic years had accumulated through the avarice and apostasy of the Israelites, who had deprived their land of its appointed season of rest. The number of those sabbatic years seems to have been seventy, as determined by the duration of the captivity. This early prediction is very remarkable, considering that the usual policy of the Assyrian conquerors was to send colonies to cultivate and inhabit their newly acquired provinces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They shall fall one upon another, </span> as soldiers use to do when their ranks are broken, and they forced to flee away hastily from their pursuers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When non pursueth; </span> your guilt and fear causing you to imagine that they do pursue you when indeed they do not. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they shall fall one upon another,.... In their hurry and confusion, everyone making all the haste he can to escape the imaginary danger; or "a man upon his brother" (z); his friend, as Aben Ezra interprets it, having no regard to relation and friendship, every one endeavouring to save himself. There is another sense which some Jewish writers (a) give of this phrase, and is observed by Jarchi, which is, that everyone shall fall for the iniquities of his brother; for all the Israelites say, they are sureties for one another; but the former sense is best: <p>as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: as if a sword was drawn and brandished at them, just ready to be thrust in them, filling them with the utmost dread and terror, and yet at the same time none in pursuit of them: <p>and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies; no heart to resist them, no strength nor spirit to oppose them, and defend themselves but be obliged to surrender their cities, themselves, their families and goods, into the hand of the enemy. <p>(z)  "vir in fratrem suum", Vatablus, Drusius, Piscator.
