But national prosperity was the effect of national obedience, and national judgments were brought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiar covenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people, especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel are enjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as the reproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, we might avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us!

The antithesis in <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> is this: The land shall enjoy her sabbaths - and they shall enjoy the punishment of their iniquity.

The construction is the following: &#1493;&#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42</a>) corresponds to &#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a>) as the apodosis; so that, according to the more strictly logical connection, which is customary in our language, we may unite <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a> in one period with <a href="/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42</a>. "If they shall confess their iniquity...or rather their uncircumcised heart shall humble itself...I will remember My covenant." With &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; a parenthetical clause is introduced into the main sentence explanatory of the iniquity, and reaches as far as "into the land of their enemies." With &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506; &#1488;&#1493;&#1470;&#1488;&#1494;, "or if, etc.," the main sentence is resumed. &#1488;&#1493;, "or rather" (as in <a href="/1_samuel/29-3.htm">1 Samuel 29:3</a>), bringing out the humiliation of the heart as the most important result to which the confession of sin ought to deepen itself. The heart is called "uncircumcised" as being unsanctified, and not susceptible to the manifestations of divine grace. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1509;&#787;&#1492;&#1503;&#1498;&#1495;&#769;&#1507;&#1503;&#1509;&#1507;&#1497; &#1508;&#1489;&#768;&#1506; &#1489;&#787;&#1500;&#1489;&#1505;&#1508;&#1497;&#769;&#1489;&#1506; &#1489;&#1509;&#787;&#1508;&#1513;&#834;&#1501; (lxx), they will take pleasure, rejoice in their misdeeds, i.e., in the consequences and results of them-that their misdeed have so deeply humbled them, and brought them to the knowledge of the corruption into which they have fallen: a bold and, so to speak, paradoxical expression for their complete change of heart, which we may render thus: "they will enjoy their misdeeds," as &#1512;&#1510;&#1492; may be rendered in the same way in <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> also.<p>(Note: Luther has translated &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; in this sense, "punishment of iniquity," and observes in the marginal notes, - "(Pleasure), i.e., just as they had pleasure in their sins and felt disgust at My laws, so they would now take pleasure in their punishment and say, 'We have just what we deserve. This is what we have to thank our cursed sin for. It is just, O God, quite just.' And these are thoughts and words of earnest repentance, hating itself from the bottom of the heart, and crying out, Shame upon me, what have I done? This pleases God, so that He becomes gracious once more.")<p>But where punishment bears such fruit, God looks upon the sinner with favour again. When Israel had gone so far, He would remember His covenant with the fathers ("My covenant with Jacob," &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;: the suffix is attached to the governing noun, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>, because the noun governed, being a proper name, could not take the suffix), and remember the land (including its inhabitants), which, as is repeated again in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a>, would be left by them (become desolate) and enjoy its Sabbaths whilst it was waste (depopulated) from (i.e., away from, without) them; and they would enjoy their iniquity, because they had despised the judgments of the Lord, and their soul had rejected His statues. </body></html>
