Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fourth warning.

Seven, as the number of perfection in the works of God, denotes the strengthening of the chastisement, even to the height of its full measure (cf. <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). &#1506;&#1494; &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, lit., the eminence or pride of strength, includes everything upon which a nation rests its might; then the pride and haughtiness which rely upon earthly might and its auxiliaries (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>); here it signifies the pride of a nation, puffed up by the fruitfulness and rich produce of its land. God would make their heaven (the sky of their land) like iron and their earth like brass, i.e., as hard and dry as metal, so that not a drop of rain and dew would fall from heaven to moisten the earth, and not a plant could grow out of the earth (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>); and when the land was cultivated, the people would exhaust their strength for nought. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, consumi. </body></html>
