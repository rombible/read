Two things would bring ruin. 1. A contempt of God's commandments. They that reject the precept, will come at last to renounce the covenant. 2. A contempt of his corrections. If they will not learn obedience by the things they suffer, God himself would be against them; and this is the root and cause of all their misery. And also, The whole creation would be at war with them. All God's sore judgments would be sent against them. The threatenings here are very particular, they were prophecies, and He that foresaw all their rebellions, knew they would prove so. TEMPORAL judgments are threatened. Those who will not be parted from their sins by the commands of God, shall be parted from them by judgments. Those wedded to their lusts, will have enough of them. SPIRITUAL judgments are threatened, which should seize the mind. They should find no acceptance with God. A guilty conscience would be their continual terror. It is righteous with God to leave those to despair of pardon, who presume to sin; and it is owing to free grace, if we are not left to pine away in the iniquity we were born in, and have lived in.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The third warning is the multiplication of destructive animals, etc. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

For this, severe judgments are announced, which were to be carried to their uttermost in a fourfold series, if the hardening were obstinately continued. If Israel acted in opposition to the Lord in the manner stated, He would act towards them as follows (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>): He would appoint over them &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; terror, - a general notion, which is afterwards particularized as consisting of diseases, sowing without enjoying the fruit, defeat in war, and flight before their enemies. Two kinds of disease are mentioned by which life is destroyed: consumption and burning, i.e., burning fever, &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, febris, which cause the eyes (the light of this life) to disappear, and the soul (the life itself) to pine away; whereas in <a href="/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, preservation from diseases is promised for obedience to the law. Of these diseases, consumption is at present very rare in Palestine and Syria, though it occurs in more elevated regions; but burning fever is one of the standing diseases. To these there would be added the invasion of the land by enemies, so that they would labour in vain and sow their seed to no purpose, for their enemies would consume the produce, as actually was the case (e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3-4</a>). </body></html>
