But national prosperity was the effect of national obedience, and national judgments were brought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiar covenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people, especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel are enjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as the reproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, we might avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us!

The Targum of Jonathan adds,"in the time of their distress;''which might serve to bring their sins to remembrance, and them to a confession of them, not only of their own sins, but of their fathers' also; acknowledging thereby that they had been guilty of sinning against God for a long course of years past; and that God had been long suffering towards them, and bore much with them before he brought his judgments on them, which were just, and what they righteously deserved; and such a confession Daniel made, <a href="/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4</a>; and the words may as well be rendered absolute as conditional, or better, and as a prediction of what would be done by them when in captivity and distress, "and they shall confess their iniquity" (c); with shame and sorrow, with repentance for it, and abhorrence of it; or otherwise, if the confession was only verbal and hypocritical, it would not be acceptable: <p>with their trespass which they trespassed against me; along with their own iniquities, and those of their fathers, they should confess, their trespass against the Lord would be acknowledged by them; which seems to design some particular and grievous sin committed by them, by which perhaps is meant their idolatry, a capital sin, directly against God, and what those people were prone unto: <p>and that also they have walked contrary unto me; to his mind and will, to his laws, commands, statutes, and ordinances, disregarding him and them, as if enemies to him; or "by chance"; See Gill on <a href="/leviticus/26-21.htm">Leviticus 26:21</a>. <p>(c) "et confitebuntur", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/leviticus/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>40–45. <span class="ital">Repentance shall bring restoration<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 40-45.</span> - God's pardon will, even yet, as always, follow upon confession of sin and genuine repentance. They must recognize not only that they have sinned, but that their sufferings have been a punishment for those sins at God's hand. This will work in them humble acquiescence in God's doings, and then he will remember his covenant with Jacob, and also his covenant with Isaac, and also his covenant with Abraham, and for the sake of the covenant of their ancestors, he will not east them away, neither will he abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break his covenant with them. Whether Jewish repentance has been or ever will be so full as to obtain this blessing, cannot be decided now. Perhaps it may be the case that all the blessings promised by Moses and by future prophets to repentant and restored Israel are to find their accomplishment in the spiritual Israel, the children of Abraham who is "the father of all them that believe" (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>), seeing that "God is able of stones to raise up children unto Abraham" (<a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Object of the Divine Judgments in Relation to the Land and Nation of Israel. - <a href="/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26-35.htm">Leviticus 26:35</a>.

The keeping of the Sabbath was not a performance binding upon the land, nor had the land been in fault because the Sabbath was not kept. As the earth groans under the pressure of the sin of men, so does it rejoice in deliverance from this pressure, and participation in the blessed rest of the whole creation. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;: the land "will rest (keep) what it has not rested on your Sabbaths and whilst you dwelt in it;" i.e., it will make up the rest which you did not give it on your Sabbaths (daily and yearly). It is evident from this, that the keeping of the Sabbaths and sabbatical years was suspended when the apostasy of the nation increased, - a result which could be clearly foreseen in consequence of the inward dislike of a sinner to the commandments of the holy God, and which is described in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a> as having actually occurred. </body></html>
