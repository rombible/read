From the fact that the expression “covenant” is here exceptionally repeated before the name of each patriarch, the authorities during the second Temple rightly concluded that it refers to three distinct covenants made respectively with the patriarchs. Hence the Chaldee Versions render it, “And I will remember in mercy the covenant which I covenanted with Jacob at Bethel [<a href="/context/genesis/35-9.htm" title="And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.">Genesis 35:9-15</a>], and also the covenant which I covenanted with Isaac at Mount Moriah [Genesis 22], and the covenant which I covenanted with Abraham between the divided pieces [of the sacrifices (<a href="/context/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18-21</a>)].” The ancients also call attention to the fact that whilst in all other passages where the three patriarchs are mentioned together, the order is according to their seniority, viz., Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm" title="And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.">Exodus 2:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm" title="And I will bring you in to the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-13.htm" title="Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.">Exodus 32:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-13.htm" title="That he may establish you to day for a people to himself, and that he may be to you a God, as he has said to you, and as he has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.">Deuteronomy 29:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed: I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over thither.">Deuteronomy 34:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-23.htm" title="And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.">2Kings 13:23</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/105-8.htm" title="He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.">Psalm 105:8-10</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/16-16.htm" title="Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac;">1Chronicles 16:16-17</a>), this is the solitary instance where the regular order is inverted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/26-42.htm" title="Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.">Leviticus 26:42</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will remember my covenant — </span>So as to make good all that I have promised in it.

But national prosperity was the effect of national obedience, and national judgments were brought on by national wickedness. Israel was under a peculiar covenant. National wickedness will end in the ruin of any people, especially where the word of God and the light of the gospel are enjoyed. Sooner or later, sin will be the ruin, as well as the reproach, of every people. Oh that, being humbled for our sins, we might avert the rising storm before it bursts upon us!
