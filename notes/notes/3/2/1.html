The word <span class="ital">meat-offering </span>(which is supposed by some to have been an ancient false print, that has run through many editions of our Bible, for <span class="ital">meal-offering) </span>conveys a quite different idea to the English reader. It certainly would be better rendered <span class="ital">meal-offering, </span>or <span class="ital">wheat-offering. </span>It was of two kinds: the one which, being joined with other offerings, (<a href="/numbers/15-4.htm" title="Then shall he that offers his offering to the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.">Numbers 15:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-7.htm" title="And for a drink offering you shall offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet smell to the LORD.">Numbers 15:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-10.htm" title="And you shall bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Numbers 15:10</a>,) was particularly prescribed with the measure and proportion of it. The other, which is here spoken of, was left to the offerer’s good-will, both for the thing offered and the quantity. As to the matter of these <span class="ital">minchas, </span>or offerings of things inanimate, it was of such things as were of great use to the support of human life, namely, flour, bread, wine, salt, &c. Now this sort of sacrifices was appointed, 1st, Because these are things of the greatest necessity and benefit to man, and therefore it is meet that God should be served with them, and owned and praised as the giver of them. 2d, In condescension to the poor, that they might not want an offering for God, and to show that God would accept even the meanest services, when offered with a sincere mind. Some of these offerings were for the whole congregation, as the <span class="ital">waved sheaf, </span>(<a href="/leviticus/23-11.htm" title="And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.">Leviticus 23:11</a>,) and the two <span class="ital">waved loaves, </span><a href="/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>. Some, again, were for private persons; among which were that for the poor sinner who could not afford the more expensive sacrifices, <a href="/leviticus/5-11.htm" title="But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:11</a>, that, for the suspected woman, <a href="/numbers/5-15.htm" title="Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.">Numbers 5:15</a>; besides the voluntary ones. <span class="ital">He shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon — </span>To make a sweet odour in the court of the tabernacle, which otherwise would have been very offensive, by reason of the blood that was sprinkled and the flesh that was burned there daily.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Besides, the pouring oil, and putting frankincense thereon, signified its being grateful and acceptable to God. And therefore in the offering of jealousy, when guilt was supposed, and sin brought to remembrance, no oil nor frankincense was to be put on the oblation. Now both these things were emblematical of spiritual blessings; the oil of the graces of the Holy Spirit, which are compared to oil and to anointing therewith, (<a href="/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a>,) and are necessary to make any offering acceptable to God; and the frankincense of Christ’s atonement and intercession, compared to a sweet odour, <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>. And the intention of all these offerings being fully answered by the mediation of the Messiah and the blessings of his gospel, it was proper they should cease upon his death, as is thought to have been expressly foretold, <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/leviticus/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Meat-offerings may typify Christ, as presented to God for us, and as being the Bread of life to our souls; but they rather seem to denote our obligation to God for the blessings of providence, and those good works which are acceptable to God. The term meat was, and still is, properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of this offering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings are mentioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such services cannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, and hypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directly opposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which God approves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and the practice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, was wholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering life and agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. His people are called to follow, and to be like him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A meat offering - Better translated in <a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a> an oblation of a meat offering &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;  qorba&#770;n, see <a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a> &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;ncha&#772;h. signifies literally a "gift"; and it appears to have been applied especially to what was given by an inferior to a superior <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-18.htm">Genesis 32:18-20</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a> : but in the technical language of the Law, it regularly denoted the vegetable offerings as distinguished from the animal offerings.

and one that offered in this manner, it was all one as if he offered his soul to the Lord (s): there were some meat offerings which were appointed and fixed at certain times, and were obliged to be offered, as at the daily sacrifice, the consecration of priests, the waving of the sheaf, &amp;c. <a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a> but this was a freewill offering; wherefore it is said, "when any man will offer"; the Hebrew word  "a meat offering", may be derived from  "to bring" or "offer", and so is a name common to offerings of any sort; or from  to "recreate" and delight, it being of a sweet savour to the Lord, as other offerings were;

and though it might be taken out of any part of the land of Israel and used, yet it chiefly came from hence (t); and according to the Jewish writers (u); the least quantity of fine flour used in a meat offering was the tenth part of an ephah, which was about three pints and a half, and a fifth part of half a pint: Christ was prefigured by the meat offering; his sacrifice came in the room of it, and put an end to it, <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> whose flesh is meat indeed, the true meat or bread, in distinction from this typical meat offering, <a href="/john/6-55.htm">John 6:55</a> the fine flour denotes the choiceness, excellency, and purity of Christ;

and the common quantity was a log, or half a pint, to a tenth deal of fine flour, as Gersom asserts from the wise men, and to which Maimonides (x) agrees; and Gersom on the place observes, that it is proper that some of the oil should be put in the lower part of the vessel, and after that the fine flour should put in it, and then he should pour some of it upon it and mix it: the oil denotes the grace of the Spirit poured out upon Christ without measure, the oil of gladness, with which he was anointed above his fellows, and from whence he has the name of Messiah or Christ, or Anointed; and with which he was anointed to be prophet, priest, and King, and which renders him very desirable and delightful to his people, his name being as ointment poured forth, <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>. <p>and put frankincense thereon; on a part of it, as Jarchi's note is; and according to him, the man that brought the meat offering left an handful of frankincense upon it on one side; and the reason of this was, because it was not to be mixed with it as the oil was, and it was not to be taken in the handful with it (z); and the quantity of the frankincense, as Gersom says, was one handful: this denoted the sweet odour and acceptableness of Christ, the meat offering, both to God and to his people: it is an observation of the Jewish writers, that the pouring out of the oil on the fine flour, and mixing it with it, and putting on the frankincense, might be done by a stranger, by any man, by the man that brought the meat offering, but what follows after the bringing of it to the priest were done by him (a). <p>(s) Jarchi, Aben Ezra, &amp;

The word used in the original for "meat offering" (<span class="accented">minchah</span>), means, like its Greek equivalent, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a gift made by an inferior to a superior. Thus the sacrifices of Cain and Abel were their "minchah" to God (<a href="/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3, 4</a>), the present sent to Esau by Jacob was his "minchah" (<a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>), and the present to Joseph was his brethren's "minchah" (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>). It is therefore equivalent to a gift of homage, which recognizes the superiority of him to whom it is offered, and ceremonially promises loyal obedience to him. Owing to its use in this passage, it came gradually to be confined in its signification to vegetable gifts, - unbloody sacrifices, as they are called sometimes, in contrast to animal sacrifices - while the word "corban" crone to be used in the wider acceptation which once belonged to "minchah." The conditions to be fulfilled by the Israelite who offered a meat offering were the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He must offer either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> uncooked flour, with oil, salt, and frankincense, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> flour made into an unleavened cake (whether of the nature of biscuit or pancake), with oil, salt, and frankincense; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> roasted grains, with oil, salt, and frankincense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He must bring his offering to the court of the tabernacle, and give to the priests at least as much as one omer (that is, nearly a gallon), and not more than sixty-one omers. The priest receiving it from him must: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Take a handful of the flour, oil, and salt, or a proportionate part of the cake (each omer generally made ten cakes) in place of the flour, and burn it with all the frankincense as a <span class="accented">memorial</span> upon the altar of burnt offering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> With his brother priests he must eat the remainder within the precincts of the tabernacle. Here the essentials of the sacrifice are the presentation made by the offerer, and the burning of <span class="accented">the memorial</span> on the altar, followed by the consumption of the remainder by the priests. The moral lesson taught to the Israelite completed that of the burnt offering. As the burnt offering taught self-surrender, so the meat offering taught recognition of God's supremacy and submission to it, the first by the surrender of a living creature substituted for the offerer, the second by the gift of a part of the good things bestowed by God on man for the preservation of life which, being given back to God, serve as a recognition of his supremacy. Spiritually the lesson taught the Jew was that of the necessity of a loyal service to God; and mystically he may have learnt a lesson <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as to the force of prayer rising up to heaven as the incense which had to be offered with each form of the meat offering; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to the need of purity and incorruption, symbolized by the prohibition of leaven and honey, and the command to use salt. The supplemental character of the meat offering accounts for the order in which it here stands, not arbitrarily interposed between two animal sacrifices, but naturally following on the burnt offering, as an adjunct to it and the complement of its teaching. So close was the union between the two sacrifices, that the burnt offering was never offered without the accompaniment of the meat offering (<a href="/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4</a>). It has been also maintained that the meat offering, like the drink offering, was never made independently of the animal sacrifice; but this cannot be proved. On the contrary, the manner in which laws regulating it are here laid down, lead to the inference that it might be offered, when any willed it, by itself. The close connection between the sacrifice of an animal and the offering of cakes of flour, and of wine, is noticeable in heathen sacrifices likewise. The very word, <span class="accented">immolare</span>, translated "to sacrifice," is derived from the <span class="accented">mola</span> or salt-cake offered with the animal; and the other word ordinarily used in Latin for "sacrifice," that is, <span class="accented">mactare</span>, is derived from the victim being enriched (<span class="accented">magis auctus</span>) with the libation of wine. Thus we see that the offering of the fruits of the earth was regarded, elsewhere as well as in Judaea, as the natural concomitant of an animal sacrifice, and not only that, but as so essential a part of the latter as to have given a name to the whole ceremony, and not only to the whole ceremony, but to the specific act of the slaughter of the victim. The thought of the heathen in offering the fruits of the earth was probably not much different from that of the Israelites. It was his gift to the superhuman power, to which he thus acknowledged that he owed submission. We may further notice that salt was enjoined in the heathen as in the Jewish sacrifices as indispensable. Pliny says that the importance of salt is seen especially in sacrifices, none of which are completed without the salt-cake ('Hist. Nat.,' 31, 7) The now obsolete use of the word "meat" in the sense of "food," in contrast to "flesh," creates some confusion of thought. "Fruit offering" would be a better title, were it not that the signification of "fruit" is going through a similar change to that which "meat" has undergone. "Flour offering" might be used, but an alteration in the rendering is not imperative. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With regard to the mode of sacrificing, the instructions already given for the oxen applied to the flock (i.e., to the sheep and goats) as well, so that the leading points are repeated here, together with a more precise description of the place for slaughtering, viz., "by the side of the altar towards the north," i.e., on the north side of the altar. This was the rule with all the slain-offerings; although it is only in connection with the burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, and trespass-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-24.htm">Leviticus 4:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-29.htm">Leviticus 4:29</a>, <a href="/leviticus/4-33.htm">Leviticus 4:33</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-13.htm">Leviticus 14:13</a>) that it is expressly mentioned, whilst the indefinite expression "at the door (in front) of the tabernacle" is applied to the peace-offerings in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-13.htm">Leviticus 3:13</a>, as it is to the trespass-offerings in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-4.htm">Leviticus 4:4</a>, from which the Rabbins have inferred, though hardly upon good ground, that the peace-offerings could be slaughtered in any part of the court. The northern side of the altar was appointed as the place of slaughtering, however, not from the idea that the Deity dwelt in the north (Ewald), for such an idea is altogether foreign to Mosaism, but, as Knobel supposes, probably because the table of shew-bread, with the continual meat-offering, stood on the north side in the holy place. Moreover, the eastern side of the altar in the court was the place for the refuse, or heap of ashes (<a href="/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a>); the ascent to the altar was probably on the south side, as Josephus affirms that it was in the second temple (J. de bell. jud. v. 5, 6); and the western side, or the space between the altar and the entrance to the holy place, would unquestionably have been the most unsuitable of all for the slaughtering.
