When the Arabs make a covenant together, they put salt on the blade of a sword, from whence every one puts a little into his mouth.

God hereby intimates to them that their sacrifices, in themselves, were unsavoury. All religious services must be seasoned with grace. Christianity is the salt of the earth. Directions are given about offering their first-fruits at harvest. If a man, with a thankful sense of God's goodness in giving him a plentiful crop, was disposed to present an offering to God, let him bring the first ripe and full ears. Whatever was brought to God must be the best in its kind, though it were but green ears of corn. Oil and frankincense must be put upon it. Wisdom and humility soften and sweeten the spirits and services of young people, and their green ears of corn shall be acceptable. God takes delight in the first ripe fruits of the Spirit, and the expressions of early piety and devotion. Holy love to God is the fire by which all our offerings must be made. The frankincense denotes the mediation and intercession of Christ, by which our services are accepted. Blessed be God that we have the substance, of which these observances were but shadows. There is that excellency in Christ, and in his work as Mediator, which no types and shadows can fully represent. And our dependence thereon must be so entire, that we must never lose sight of it in any thing we do, if we would be accepted of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt - Not only every &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;ncha&#772;h, but every animal offering was to be accompanied by salt. It was the one symbol which was never absent from the altar of burnt-offering, showing the imperishablness of the love of Yahweh for His people. In its unalterable nature, it is the contrary of leaven (yeast).

No injunction in the whole law was more sacredly observed than this application of salt; for besides other uses of it that will be noticed elsewhere, it had a typical meaning referred to by our Lord concerning the effect of the Gospel on those who embrace it (Mr 9:49, 50); as when plentifully applied it preserves meat from spoiling, so will the Gospel keep men from being corrupted by sin. And as salt was indispensable to render sacrifices acceptable to God, so the Gospel, brought home to the hearts of men by the Holy Ghost, is indispensably requisite to their offering up of themselves as living sacrifices [Brown].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

They brought it as an accompaniment of sacrifice, in accordance with the primitive view of sacrifice as the food of the gods (cp. ch. <a href="/leviticus/21-22.htm" title="He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.">Leviticus 21:22</a>). It may have been an element in the Jewish ritual from the earliest times. The phrase ‘salt of the covenant of thy God’ indicates that a symbolical meaning was also attached to it. A covenant among ancient peoples was ratified by eating food together (<a href="/genesis/31-54.htm" title="Then Jacob offered sacrifice on the mount, and called his brothers to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.">Genesis 31:54</a>) with which salt was generally taken. ‘There is salt between us’ is in the mouth of the Arab a declaration of friendship and obligation; God’s covenants with Levi and David are ‘covenants of salt’ (<a href="/numbers/18-19.htm" title="All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm" title="Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>); so here ‘the salt of the covenant’ implies that the Israelite, by reason of his covenant relation with God, was bound to bring with his sacrifice the offering of a willing heart (<a href="/psalms/54-6.htm" title="I will freely sacrifice to you: I will praise your name, O LORD; for it is good.">Psalm 54:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-108.htm" title="Accept, I beseech you, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me your judgments.">Psalm 119:108</a>). Salt with sacrifice is enjoined in <a href="/ezekiel/43-24.htm" title="And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.">Ezekiel 43:24</a>, and referred to <a href="/mark/9-49.htm" title="For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.">Mark 9:49</a>. For the remission of the tax on salt, cp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-29.htm" title="And now do I free you, and for your sake I release all the Jews, from tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from crown taxes,">1Ma 10:29</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/11-35.htm" title="And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithes and customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them all for their relief.">1Ma 11:35</a>, and Jos. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xii. 3. 3.

Salt is commanded as symbolizing in things spiritual, because preserving in things physical, incorruption (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>; <a href="/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>; <a href="/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>). It is an emblem of an established and enduring covenant, such as God's covenant with his people, which is never to wax old and be destroyed, and it is therefore termed the salt of the covenant of thy God. Hence "a covenant of salt" came to mean a covenant that should not be broken (<a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>). The use of salt is not confined to the meat offering. With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. Accordingly we find in <a href="/ezekiel/43-24.htm">Ezekiel 43:24</a>, "The priest shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thirdly, "If thy oblation be a tigel-minchah, it shall be made of fine flour with oil."
