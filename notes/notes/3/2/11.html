The term meat was, and still is, properly given to any kind of provision, and the greater part of this offering was to be eaten for food, not burned. These meat-offerings are mentioned after the burnt-offerings: without an interest in the sacrifice of Christ, and devotedness of heart to God, such services cannot be accepted. Leaven is the emblem of pride, malice, and hypocrisy, and honey of sensual pleasure. The former are directly opposed to the graces of humility, love, and sincerity, which God approves; the latter takes men from the exercises of devotion, and the practice of good works. Christ, in his character and sacrifice, was wholly free from the things denoted by leaven; and his suffering life and agonizing death were the very opposites to worldly pleasure. His people are called to follow, and to be like him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for the oblation of the firstfruits - Rather, As an oblation of firstfruits.

Baal Hatturim on the place says, the corruption of nature is sweet to a man as honey, and intimates that that is the reason of its prohibition: it denotes unto us that such as would feed by faith on Christ ought to relinquish sinful lusts and pleasures; and that those that will live godly in Christ Jesus must not expect their sweets, but bitters, even afflictions, reproaches, and persecutions, for Christ's sake, in this life. <p>(p) Misn.

The idea of corruption in connexion with leaven was familiar to the Romans. Plutarch (<span class="ital">Quaest. Rom.</span> 109) says: ‘Leaven is born of corruption, and corrupts that with which it is mixed … all fermentation is a kind of putrefaction.’ The Flamen Dialis, a priest of Jupiter in one of the oldest Roman cults, among many other restrictions of ancient date, was not allowed to touch leavened bread (Sir J. G. Frazer, <span class="ital">Golden Bough</span>3, Pt II. 13 and his references on p. 14, note 3, to Aulus Gellius x. 15, Pliny, <span class="ital">Nat. Hist.</span> xxviii. 146, and other writers: see also Pauly’s <span class="ital">Real Encyc</span>. (ed. G. Wissowa) vi. 2485 ff.). This idea is in the N.T., where ‘leaven’ is used figuratively of the corrupt doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="/luke/12-1.htm" title="In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they stepped one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.">Luke 12:1</a>), and by St Paul as representing ‘malice and wickedness’ in contrast with ‘the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth’ (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:...">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>). But there is no such contrast implied in the prohibition of leaven at the feast of the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm" title="Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-19.htm" title="Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-7.htm" title="Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you in all your quarters.">Exodus 13:7</a>). The unleavened bread is regarded as ‘bread of affliction’ (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm" title="You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>), less pleasant than ordinary leavened bread, reminding the Israelites of bondage as well as deliverance.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - Ye shall burn no leaven nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord made by fire. Leaven and honey are not forbidden to be offered to the Lord; on the contrary, in the next verse they are commanded to be offered. The prohibition only extends to their being burnt on the altar, owing, no doubt, to the effect of fire upon them in making them swell and froth, thus creating a repulsive appearance which, as we shall see, throughout the Mosaic legislation, represents moral evil. The firstfruits of honey are to be offered (cf. <a href="/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>), and leaven is to be used in the two wave loaves offered at the Feast of Pentecost as firstfruits (<a href="/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>). the words translated, As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord, should be rendered, <span class="accented">As an oblation of firstfruits ye shall offer them</span> (that <span class="accented">is</span>, leaven and honey), <span class="accented">but they shall not be burnt on the altar.</span> The mark in A.V. denoting a new paragraph at the beginning of verse 12, should be removed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Secondly, if the minchah was an offering upon the pan, it was also to be made of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened. Machabath is a pan, made, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-3.htm">Ezekiel 4:3</a>, of iron-no doubt a large iron plate, such as the Arabs still use for baking unleavened bread in large round cakes made flat and thin (Robinson, Palestine i. 50, ii. 180). These girdles or flat pans are still in use among the Turcomans of Syria and the Armenians (see Burckhardt, Syr. p. 1003; Tavernier, Reise 1, p. 280), whilst the Berbians and Cabyles of Africa use shallow iron frying-pans for the purpose, and call them tajen, - the same name, no doubt, as &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, with which the lxx have rendered machabath. These cakes were to be broken in pieces for the minchah, and oil to be poured upon them (the inf. abs. as in <a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>, vid., Ges. 131, 4); just as the Bedouins break the cakes which they bake in the hot ashes into small pieces, and prepare them for eating by pouring butter or oil upon them.</body></html>
