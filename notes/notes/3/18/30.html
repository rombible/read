These abominations were not practised simply as customs, but were legally enacted as statutes of the land, and formed part of their religious institutions (see <a href="/leviticus/18-3.htm" title="After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein you dwelled, shall you not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, where I bring you, shall you not do: neither shall you walk in their ordinances.">Leviticus 18:3</a>). A similar state of degeneracy is described by Isaiah, who tells us that the Divine statutes, which is the same word used in the passage before us, were changed. By deviating here from the usual rendering of this phrase the Authorised Version mars the import of the passage.<p><span class= "bld">I am the Lord your God.</span>â€”This is the declaration with which this group of laws was introduced. Its repetition at the end imparts peculiar solemnity to these enactments.

Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. Nor does He ever leave any to their hearts' lusts, till they have left him and his services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/leviticus/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The land designed and consecrated for His people by Yahweh <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a> is here impersonated, and represented as vomiting forth its present inhabitants, in consequence of their indulgence in the abominations that have been mentioned. The iniquity of the Canaanites was now full. See <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-6</a>. The Israelites in this place, and throughout the chapter, are exhorted to a pure and holy life, on the ground that Yahweh, the Holy One, is their God and that they are His people. Compare <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. It is upon this high sanction that they are peremptorily forbidden to defile themselves with the pollutions of the pagan. The only punishment here pronounced upon individual transgressors is, that they shall "bear their iniquity" and be "cut off from among their people." We must understand this latter phrase as expressing an "ipso facto" excommunication or outlawry, the divine Law pronouncing on the offender an immediate forfeiture of the privileges which belonged to him as one of the people in covenant with Yahweh. See <a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> note. The course which the Law here takes seems to be first to appeal to the conscience of the individual man on the ground of his relation to Yahweh, and then <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20.htm">Leviticus 20</a> to enact such penalties as the order of the state required, and as represented the collective conscience of the nation put into operation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs&#8212;In giving the Israelites these particular institutions, God was only re-delivering the law imprinted on the natural heart of man; for there is every reason to believe that the incestuous alliances and unnatural crimes prohibited in this chapter were forbidden to all men by a law expressed or understood from the beginning of the world, or at least from the era of the flood, since God threatens to condemn and punish, in a manner so sternly severe, these atrocities in the practice of the Canaanites and their neighbors, who were not subject to the laws of the Hebrew nation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance,.... Whatever the Lord appointed them and commanded, whether contained in this chapter, or elsewhere: <p>that ye commit not anyone of these abominable customs; for attending to the ordinances of God, and a close in them, they would be preserved from the commission of such abominable things, and giving in to such detestable customs as before warned against: <p>which were committed before you; by the inhabitants of Canaan; and by the punishment on them for them they might be deterred from doing the same: <p>and that ye defile not yourselves therein; for though the land is so often said to be defiled, yet, properly speaking, and chiefly, it was the inhabitants that were defiled by their abominable customs; and so would the Israelites also, should they observe the same, and thereby become abominable in the sight of God, and incur his displeasure, and be liable to his vengeance: <p>I am the Lord your God; who had a sovereign authority over them, and a right to give out what commands he pleased, both negative and affirmative; and to whom they were under obligations to obey, as the God of nature and providence, from whom they had their beings, and were supported in them, and as their covenant God, who had bestowed special and spiritual favours on them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the concluding exhortation God pointed expressly to the fact, that the nations which He was driving out before the Israelites (the participle &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; is used of that which is certainly and speedily coming to pass) had defiled the land by such abominations as those, that He had visited their iniquity and the land had spat out its inhabitants, and warned the Israelites to beware of these abominations, that the land might not spit them out as it had the Canaanites before them. The pret. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1488; (<a href="/leviticus/18-25.htm">Leviticus 18:25</a>) and &#1511;&#1488;&#1492; (<a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>) are prophetic (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-22.htm">Leviticus 20:22-23</a>), and the expression is poetical. The land is personified as a living creature, which violently rejects food that it dislikes. "Hoc enim tropo vult significare Scriptura enormitatem criminum, quod scilicet ipsae creaturae irrationales suo creatori semper obedientes et pro illo pugnantes detestentur peccatores tales eosque terra quasi evomat, cum illi expelluntur ab ea" (C. a Lap.). </body></html>
