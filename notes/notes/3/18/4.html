Which are just and right, and according to the rules of justice and equity; these are things, as Jarchi observes, which are said in the law with judgment, or are laws framed with the highest reason, even by the judgment of God himself, whose judgment is always according to truth: Aben Ezra thinks, these are the judicial laws in <a href="/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1</a>; but though they may include them, they have more particular respect to the following laws: <p>and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: which he had ordained and appointed of his own will and pleasure, which Jarchi calls the decree of the king, or which he decreed and determined as a king, having absolute power over his subjects to enact and enjoin what he pleased; wherefore some think these refer to ceremonial laws, which depended upon the will of the lawgiver, and were not founded in any natural sense or reason, wherefore it follows: <p>I am the Lord your God: who had a right to make what laws he pleased, being their Sovereign, and which they in gratitude as well as in justice ought to obey, he being their God, their covenant God, who had done great and good things for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/leviticus/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/leviticus/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For as for the soul of all flesh...its blood makes out its soul:" i.e., "this is the case with the soul of all flesh, that it is its blood which makes out its soul." &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; is to be taken as a predicate in its meaning, introduced with beth essentiale. It is only as so understood, that the clause supplies a reason at all in harmony with the context. Because the distinguishing characteristic of the blood as, that it was the soul of the being when living in the flesh; therefore it was not to be eaten in the case of any animal: and even in the case of animals that were not proper for sacrifice, it was to be allowed to run out upon the ground, and then covered with earth, or, so to speak, buried.<p>(Note: On the truth which lay at the foundation of this idea of the unity of the soul and blood, which others of the ancients shared with the Hebrews, particularly the early Greek philosophers, see Delitzsch's bibl. Psychol. pp. 242ff. "It seems at first sight to be founded upon no other reason, than that a sudden diminution of the quantity of the blood is sure to cause death. But this phenomenon rests upon the still deeper ground, that all the activity of the body, especially that of the nervous and muscular systems, is dependent upon the circulation of the blood; for if the flow of blood is stopped from any part of the body, all its activity ceases immediately; a sensitive part loses all sensation in a very few minutes, and muscular action is entirely suspended... The blood is really the basis of the physical life; and so far the soul, as the vital principle of the body, is pre-eminently in the blood" (p. 245).)<p> - Lastly (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>, <a href="/leviticus/17-16.htm">Leviticus 17:16</a>), the prohibition against eating "that which died" (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39-40</a>), or "that which was torn" (<a href="/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>), is renewed and supplemented by the law, that whoever, either of the natives or of foreigners, should eat the flesh of that which had fallen (died a natural death), or had been torn in pieces by wild beasts (sc., thoughtlessly or in ignorance; cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-2.htm">Leviticus 5:2</a>), and neglected the legal purification afterwards, was to bear his iniquity (<a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). Of course the flesh intended is that of animals which were clean, and therefore allowable as food, when properly slaughtered, and which became unclean simply from the fact, that when they had died a natural death, or had been torn to pieces by wild beasts, the blood remained in the flesh, or did not flow out in a proper manner. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>, the &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492; (that which had fallen) was to be thrown to the dogs; but in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a> permission is given either to sell it or give it to a stranger or alien, to prevent the plea that it was a pity that such a thing should be entirely wasted, and so the more effectually to secure the observance of the command, that it was not to be eaten by an Israelite. </body></html>
