Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin.

The iniquity of the Canaanites was now full. See <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-6</a>. The Israelites in this place, and throughout the chapter, are exhorted to a pure and holy life, on the ground that Yahweh, the Holy One, is their God and that they are His people. Compare <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. It is upon this high sanction that they are peremptorily forbidden to defile themselves with the pollutions of the pagan. The only punishment here pronounced upon individual transgressors is, that they shall "bear their iniquity" and be "cut off from among their people." We must understand this latter phrase as expressing an "ipso facto" excommunication or outlawry, the divine Law pronouncing on the offender an immediate forfeiture of the privileges which belonged to him as one of the people in covenant with Yahweh. See <a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> note. The course which the Law here takes seems to be first to appeal to the conscience of the individual man on the ground of his relation to Yahweh, and then <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20.htm">Leviticus 20</a> to enact such penalties as the order of the state required, and as represented the collective conscience of the nation put into operation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it; and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants&#8212;The Canaanites, as enormous and incorrigible sinners, were to be exterminated; and this extermination was manifestly a judicial punishment inflicted by a ruler whose laws had been grossly and perseveringly outraged. But before a law can be disobeyed, it must have been previously in existence; and hence a law, prohibiting all the horrid crimes enumerated above&#8212;a law obligatory upon the Canaanites as well as other nations&#8212;was already known and in force before the Levitical law of incest was promulgated. Some general Iaw, then, prohibiting these crimes must have been published to mankind at a very early period of the world's history; and that law must either have been the moral law, originally written on the human heart, or a law on the institution of marriage revealed to Adam and known to the Canaanites and others by tradition or otherwise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For all these abominations have the men of the land done,....

Moloch was an old Canaanitish idol, called by the Phoenicians and Carthaginians Melkarth, Baal-melech, Malcom, and other such names, and related to Baal, a sun-god worshipped, like Kronos and Saturn, by the sacrifice of children. It was represented by a brazen statue, which was hollow and capable of being heated, and formed with a bull's head, and arms stretched out to receive the children to be sacrificed. From the time of Ahaz children were slain at Jerusalem in the valley of Ben-hinnom, and then sacrificed by being laid in the heated arms and burned (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20-21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-31.htm">Ezekiel 20:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37-38</a>). Now although this offering of children in the valley of Ben-hinnom is called a "slaughtering" by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>), and a "burning through (in the) fire" by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>), and although, in the times of the later kings, children were actually given up to Moloch and burned as slain-offerings, even among the Israelites; it by no means follows from this, that "passing through to Moloch," or "passing through the fire," or "passing through the fire to Moloch" (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), signified slaughtering and burning with fire, though this has been almost unanimously assumed since the time of Clericus. But according to the unanimous explanation of the Rabbins, fathers, and earlier theologians, "causing to pass through the fire" denoted primarily going through the fire without burning, a februation, or purification through fire, by which the children were consecrated to Moloch; a kind of fire-baptism, which preceded the sacrificing, and was performed, particularly in olden time, without actual sacrificing, or slaying and burning. For februation was practised among the most different nations without being connected with human sacrifices; and, like most of the idolatrous rites of the heathen, no doubt the worship of Moloch assumed different forms at different times and among different nations. If the Israelites had really sacrificed their children to Moloch, i.e., had slain and burned them, before the time of Ahaz, the burning would certainly have been mentioned before; for Solomon had built a high place upon the mountain to the east of Jerusalem for Moloch, the abomination of the children of Ammon, to please his foreign wives (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a> : see the Art. Moloch in Herzog's Cycl.). This idolatrous worship was to be punished with death by stoning, as a desecration of the name of Jehovah, and a defiling of His sanctuary (<a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>), i.e., as a practical contempt of the manifestations of the grace of the living God (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2-3</a>).</body></html>
