Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin. The grace of God only will secure us; that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace.

The iniquity of the Canaanites was now full. See <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1-6</a>. The Israelites in this place, and throughout the chapter, are exhorted to a pure and holy life, on the ground that Yahweh, the Holy One, is their God and that they are His people. Compare <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. It is upon this high sanction that they are peremptorily forbidden to defile themselves with the pollutions of the pagan. The only punishment here pronounced upon individual transgressors is, that they shall "bear their iniquity" and be "cut off from among their people." We must understand this latter phrase as expressing an "ipso facto" excommunication or outlawry, the divine Law pronouncing on the offender an immediate forfeiture of the privileges which belonged to him as one of the people in covenant with Yahweh. See <a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a> note. The course which the Law here takes seems to be first to appeal to the conscience of the individual man on the ground of his relation to Yahweh, and then <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20.htm">Leviticus 20</a> to enact such penalties as the order of the state required, and as represented the collective conscience of the nation put into operation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/leviticus/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it; and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants&#8212;The Canaanites, as enormous and incorrigible sinners, were to be exterminated; and this extermination was manifestly a judicial punishment inflicted by a ruler whose laws had been grossly and perseveringly outraged. But before a law can be disobeyed, it must have been previously in existence; and hence a law, prohibiting all the horrid crimes enumerated above&#8212;a law obligatory upon the Canaanites as well as other nations&#8212;was already known and in force before the Levitical law of incest was promulgated. Some general Iaw, then, prohibiting these crimes must have been published to mankind at a very early period of the world's history; and that law must either have been the moral law, originally written on the human heart, or a law on the institution of marriage revealed to Adam and known to the Canaanites and others by tradition or otherwise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That the land spew not you out also, when ye defile it,....

Lying with animals was connected in Egypt with the worship of the goat; at Mendes especially, where the women lay down before he-goats (Herodotus, 2, 46; Strabo, 17, p. 802). Aelian (nat. an. vii. 19) relates an account of the crime being also committed with a dog in Rome; and according to Sonnini, R. 11, p. 330, in modern Egypt men are said to lie even with female crocodiles. </body></html>
