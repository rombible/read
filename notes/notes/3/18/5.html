Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them&#8212;A special blessing was promised to the Israelites on condition of their obedience to the divine law; and this promise was remarkably verified at particular eras of their history, when pure and undefiled religion prevailed among them, in the public prosperity and domestic happiness enjoyed by them as a people. Obedience to the divine law always, indeed, ensures temporal advantages; and this, doubtless, was the primary meaning of the words, "which if a man do, he shall live in them." But that they had a higher reference to spiritual life is evident from the application made of them by our Lord (Lu 10:28) and the apostle (Ro 10:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He shall live in them; </span> not only happily here, but also eternally hereafter, as it is expounded <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/matthew/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.">Matthew 19:17</a> <a href="/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.">Romans 10:5</a></span>.

It is only as so understood, that the clause supplies a reason at all in harmony with the context. Because the distinguishing characteristic of the blood as, that it was the soul of the being when living in the flesh; therefore it was not to be eaten in the case of any animal: and even in the case of animals that were not proper for sacrifice, it was to be allowed to run out upon the ground, and then covered with earth, or, so to speak, buried.<p>(Note: On the truth which lay at the foundation of this idea of the unity of the soul and blood, which others of the ancients shared with the Hebrews, particularly the early Greek philosophers, see Delitzsch's bibl. Psychol. pp. 242ff. "It seems at first sight to be founded upon no other reason, than that a sudden diminution of the quantity of the blood is sure to cause death. But this phenomenon rests upon the still deeper ground, that all the activity of the body, especially that of the nervous and muscular systems, is dependent upon the circulation of the blood; for if the flow of blood is stopped from any part of the body, all its activity ceases immediately; a sensitive part loses all sensation in a very few minutes, and muscular action is entirely suspended... The blood is really the basis of the physical life; and so far the soul, as the vital principle of the body, is pre-eminently in the blood" (p. 245).)<p> - Lastly (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>, <a href="/leviticus/17-16.htm">Leviticus 17:16</a>), the prohibition against eating "that which died" (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39-40</a>), or "that which was torn" (<a href="/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>), is renewed and supplemented by the law, that whoever, either of the natives or of foreigners, should eat the flesh of that which had fallen (died a natural death), or had been torn in pieces by wild beasts (sc., thoughtlessly or in ignorance; cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-2.htm">Leviticus 5:2</a>), and neglected the legal purification afterwards, was to bear his iniquity (<a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). Of course the flesh intended is that of animals which were clean, and therefore allowable as food, when properly slaughtered, and which became unclean simply from the fact, that when they had died a natural death, or had been torn to pieces by wild beasts, the blood remained in the flesh, or did not flow out in a proper manner. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>, the &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492; (that which had fallen) was to be thrown to the dogs; but in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a> permission is given either to sell it or give it to a stranger or alien, to prevent the plea that it was a pity that such a thing should be entirely wasted, and so the more effectually to secure the observance of the command, that it was not to be eaten by an Israelite. </body></html>
