Hence we find Abraham, the father of the faithful, married his half-sister (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm" title="And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.">Genesis 20:12</a>). The same practice obtained amongst other nations of antiquity. Thus the Athenians married their half-sisters by their father’s side, and the Spartans married half-sisters by the same mother, whilst the Assyrians and Egyptians married full sisters. Though nothing can be more explicit than the law here laid down, and though the transgression of it is denounced as an accursed and impious crime, to be visited with capital punishment (see <a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm" title="And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-22.htm" title="Cursed be he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>), yet from the narrative of Amnon and his sister Tamar, and especially from the touching and melancholy remark of the outraged sister (<a href="/2_samuel/13-13.htm" title="And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.">2Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-16.htm" title="And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.">2Samuel 13:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-20.htm" title="And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.">2Samuel 13:20</a>), it is evident that the practice of the primitive parents of the human race and the example of the father of the Hebrew nation, continued to be followed in spite of this law. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm" title="And one has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.">Ezekiel 22:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Born at home or born abroad.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">the birth, </span>or <span class= "ital">offspring of the house or the birth, </span>or <span class= "ital">offspring from abroad. </span>According to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, the import of this precept is to forbid commerce between a brother and a sister, whether the sister is born in wedlock, which is meant by born at home, or whether she is illegitimate, which is meant by birth or offspring from abroad. Hence the ancient Chaldee Version of this clause, “whom thy father begot of another woman or of thy mother, or whom thy mother brought forth by thy father or by another man.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/leviticus/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm" title="The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or daughter of your mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness you shall not uncover.">Leviticus 18:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whether she be born at home, or born abroad — </span>Whether she be legitimately born in wedlock, or illegitimately out of wedlock.

Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin.

None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him&#8212;Very great laxity prevailed amongst the Egyptians in their sentiments and practice about the conjugal relation, as they not only openly sanctioned marriages between brothers and sisters, but even between parents and children. Such incestuous alliances Moses wisely prohibited, and his laws form the basis upon which the marriage regulations of this and other Christian nations are chiefly founded. This verse contains a general summary of all the particular prohibitions; and the forbidden intercourse is pointed out by the phrase, "to approach to." In the specified prohibitions that follow, all of which are included in this general summary, the prohibited familiarity is indicated by the phrases, to "uncover the nakedness" [Le 18:12-17], to "take" [Le 18:17, 18], and to "lie with" [Le 18:22, 23]. The phrase in this sixth verse, therefore, has the same identical meaning with each of the other three, and the marriages in reference to which it is used are those of consanguinity or too close affinity, amounting to incestuous connections.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy sister, </span> by both parents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The daughter of thy father, </span> or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">daughter of thy mother; </span> thy sister by either of thy parents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whether she be born at home, </span> to wit, of thy father by another wife, whom he hath taken into his house.

Tamar's appeal to Amnon, "I pray thee speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee," exhibits to us the poor woman grasping at any argument which might save her from her half-brother's brutality, and does not indicate that such marriages were, in the time of David, permissible (<a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>).
