For an offence of this kind both parties were punished with death.

Also laws against incest, against brutal lusts, and barbarous idolatries; and the enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites. God here gives moral precepts. Close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most effectual preservative from gross sin.

None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him&#8212;Very great laxity prevailed amongst the Egyptians in their sentiments and practice about the conjugal relation, as they not only openly sanctioned marriages between brothers and sisters, but even between parents and children. Such incestuous alliances Moses wisely prohibited, and his laws form the basis upon which the marriage regulations of this and other Christian nations are chiefly founded. This verse contains a general summary of all the particular prohibitions; and the forbidden intercourse is pointed out by the phrase, "to approach to." In the specified prohibitions that follow, all of which are included in this general summary, the prohibited familiarity is indicated by the phrases, to "uncover the nakedness" [Le 18:12-17], to "take" [Le 18:17, 18], and to "lie with" [Le 18:22, 23]. The phrase in this sixth verse, therefore, has the same identical meaning with each of the other three, and the marriages in reference to which it is used are those of consanguinity or too close affinity, amounting to incestuous connections.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/leviticus/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/leviticus/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law,....

The clause, "whether born at home or born abroad," does not refer to legitimate or illegitimate birth, but is to be taken as a more precise definition of the words, daughter of thy father or of thy mother, and understood, as Lud. de Dieu supposes, as referring to the half-sister "of the first marriage, whether the father's daughter left by a deceased wife, or the mother's daughter left by a deceased husband," so that the person marrying her would be a son by a second marriage. Sexual intercourse with a half-sister is described as &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>, and threatened with extermination. This word generally signifies sparing love, favour, grace; but here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>, it means dishonour, shame, from the Piel &#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, to dishonour. </body></html>
