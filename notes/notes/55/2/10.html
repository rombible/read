and I do it for the elect’s sakes, that is, for those whom, in His infinite mercy, God has been pleased to choose as His people, for those who, in His unfathomable love, are yet to be brought into the one fold. And this brave and steadfast endurance on the part of St. Paul contributed to the furtherance of God’s projects for gathering these elect in this wise—(1) His endurance, his patient, gallant witness in suffering, would serve as an example to many, not only to the generation then living, but to countless men and women yet unborn; and (2) his faithful, true preaching, now that his voice was hushed, in such writings as this Epistle to Timothy, would help, through the ages to come, to draw countless others, in accordance with the divine counsels, into fellowship with Christ. The question has been often asked, whether those “elect” or whom the Apostle endured these things were, when he wrote these words, <span class= "ital">believers.</span> This point has already been touched upon; it may, however, be here answered, with some certainty, that the “elect” here spoken of include both believers and unbelievers. The first—the believer—would in all ages be built up by the contemplation of the steadfastness under suffering of St. Paul; the second—the unbeliever—would be won to the faith by the divinely-inspired arguments and exhortations which the brave old man ceaselessly spoke or wrote down in prison just as when free. How could one like St. Paul, who was conscious that he himself had won the “salvation,” <span class= "ital">not patiently endure</span> all things, if such an endurance could help the elect to obtain that salvation which delivered those who obtained it from the misery of sin and death, and which besides—O blessed thought!—had the sure prospect of eternal glory?<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises. This truth makes sure the unbeliever's condemnation, and the believer's salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes; - see the notes at <a href="/2_corinthians/1-6.htm">2 Corinthians 1:6</a>.

The meaning of the apostle here is, that he was willing to suffer if he might save others; and any one ought to be willing to suffer in order to secure the salvation of the elect - for it was an object for which the Redeemer was willing to lay down his life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

There is a certain number of persons whom God has chosen in Christ from everlasting unto salvation, who shall certainly be saved; for these Jesus Christ suffered and died; and on their account is the Gospel sent, preached, and published to the world; for their sakes are ministers fitted and qualified for their work, and have their mission and commission to perform it, and suffer what they do in the execution of it; and since it was for the sake of such, whom God had loved and chosen, that the apostle endured all his reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions, he was the more cheerful under them; and the consideration of it was a support unto him: <p>that they may also obtain; as well as himself, and other chosen vessels of salvation, who were called by grace already; for the apostle is speaking of such of the elect, who were, as yet, in a state of nature: <p>the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory; salvation is only by Christ Jesus, and in him; and this is only for the elect of God; and it is published in the Gospel, that they might obtain it; and in all ages they do obtain it, or enjoy it: the thing itself is obtained by Christ for them, through his obedience, sufferings, and death; and it is published in the everlasting Gospel, that they might come to the knowledge of it; and in the effectual calling it is brought near by the Spirit of God, and applied unto them; and they have now both a meetness for it, and a right unto it, and shall fully enjoy it in heaven; for it has "eternal glory", or "heavenly glory", as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, "annexed to it"; or rather the full enjoyment of it will consist in an eternal and heavenly glory, which will be put upon the saints, both in soul and body, and remain to all eternity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο</span>] Bengel: “quia me vincto evangelium currit.” Heydenreich wrongly refers it at the same time to the reward to which <a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2 Timothy 2:8</a> alludes. The knowledge that the gospel is unfettered in its influence enables Paul to endure all things for the sake of the <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτοί</span>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο</span> cannot be referred to what follows (Wiesinger), because of the <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς</span>; it would be another thing if <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. were joined immediately with <span class="greekheb">ὑπομένω</span>; but even in that case the “abrupt transition” would still be an objection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πάντα ὑπομένω</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὑπομένειν</span> does not denote suffering pure and simple, but the willing, stedfast endurance of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By adding to <span class="greekheb">πάντα ὑπομένω</span> the words <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς</span>, explained by the succeeding clause, Paul declares that he patiently endured everything for the sake of the <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτοί</span>, because he knows that the gospel is not bound—is not made ineffectual—by his bonds. Were it otherwise, were the gospel hindered in its influence by his suffering, then he would not endure for the sake of the <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτοί</span>. Hofmann has no grounds, therefore, for thinking that the connection of <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> with the sentence following it would give an impossible sense. It is wrong to supply <span class="greekheb">καί</span> before <span class="greekheb">διὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκλ</span>. (Heydenreich), as if these words furnished an additional reason to that contained in <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐκλεκτοί</span>] This name is given to believers, inasmuch as the deepest ground of their faith is the free choice of God (<a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). Heydenreich leaves it indefinite whether “Christians already converted” are meant here, or “those elected to be future confessors of Christianity;” so, too, Matthies; de Wette, on the other hand, understands only the latter, whereas Grotius and Flatt think only of the former. The words themselves do not prove that Paul had any such distinction in mind; <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτοί</span> does not necessarily imply a contrast with present believers (de Wette), but may be quite well used in relation to the apostle himself, who was conscious of the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> attained in Christ (Wiesinger, van Oosterzee). Comp. especially <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, where the apostle places his suffering in relation to the <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>, as the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, of which the <span class="greekheb">ἐκλεκτοί</span> are members.[28] In how far the apostle bears his afflictions <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοὺς ἐκλ</span>., is told by the words: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσι τῆς ἐν Χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span>. The question how the apostle might expect this result from his <span class="greekheb">πάντα ὑπομένειν</span>, cannot be answered, by saying, with Heinrichs: “as he hoped to be freed from his sufferings;” the result was to be effected not by a release, but by the patient endurance of the suffering, inasmuch as this bore testimony to the genuineness and strength of his faith, not, as van Oosterzee thinks, because the apostle stedfastly continued to preach. The apostle’s suffering for the gospel was itself a preaching of the gospel. We must, of course, reject the notion that Paul regarded his sufferings as making atonement for sin, like those of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The addition <span class="greekheb">μετὰ δόξης αἰωνίου</span> points to the future completion of the salvation. It directs special attention to an element contained in the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>, and does not contrast the positive with the negative conception (Heydenreich).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] Hofmann rightly remarks: “The apostle names those towards whom he has to fulfil his calling, for the elect’s sake, because this designation denotes the heaviness of his responsibility, if he did not help those destined for salvation to that for which God ordained them.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>: The knowledge that others had been, and were being, saved through his ministry was regarded by St. Paul as no small part of his reward. Thus, the Churches of Macedonia were his “crown,” as well as his “joy” (<a href="/philippians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.">Php 4:1</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>). He had already in sight his “crown of righteousness”. This consideration suggests that we should refer <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> to what follows rather than to what immediately precedes (<span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέδεται</span>). So Alf., who cites in illustration <a href="/romans/4-16.htm" title="Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,">Romans 4:16</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm" title="However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.">1 Timothy 1:16</a>, <a href="/philemon/1-15.htm" title="For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;">Philemon 1:15</a>.

Ellicott rightly points out that Christian endurance is active, not passive: pain is felt as pain, but is recognised as having a moral and spiritual purpose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς</span>: St. Paul was much sustained by the thought that his labours and sufferings were, in the providence of God, beneficial to others (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-6.htm" title="And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.">2 Corinthians 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-15.htm" title="And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.">2 Corinthians 12:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>). “The elect” are those who, in the providence of God’s grace, are selected for spiritual privileges with a view directly to the salvation of others, as well as of themselves.

And St Paul just as frequently uses ‘therefore’ for the past; cf. <a href="/ephesians/5-17.htm" title="Why be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.">Ephesians 5:17</a> ‘wherefore be ye not foolish,’ <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a> ‘wherefore take up the whole armour of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Greek word rendered ‘endure’ is our Lord’s word in His charge to the Seventy, <a href="/matthew/10-22.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.">Matthew 10:22</a>, and in His discourse of the last things, <a href="/matthew/24-13.htm" title="But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.">Matthew 24:13</a>; <a href="/mark/13-13.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.">Mark 13:13</a> ‘He that endureth to the end the same shall be saved.’ St Paul has used the verb before twice only, cf. <a href="/romans/12-12.htm" title="Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;">Romans 12:12</a> ‘rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,’ <a href="/1_corinthians/13-7.htm" title="Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.">1 Corinthians 13:7</a> ‘Charity … hopeth all things, endureth all things’; both which noble passages fully bear out the significance assigned to the word by Ellicott on 1 Thess. 1:13 ‘It does not mark merely the <span class="ital">endurance</span>, the “sustinentiam” Vulg., or even the “patientiam” (Clarom.), but the “perseverantiam” the <span class="ital">brave</span> patience with which the Christian contends against the various hindrances, persecutions and temptations that befall him in his conflict with the inward and outward world.’ It occurs again <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2 Timothy 3:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the elects’ sakes</span>] For the sake of the Church; see note on <a href="/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>, where the words used at first for ‘Christians’ are discussed. The general purport is as in <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, where Lightfoot paraphrases’ I cannot choose but rejoice in my sufferings. Yes, I Paul the persecutor, I Paul the feeble and sinful, am permitted to supplement—I do not shrink from the word—to supplement the afflictions of Christ. My flesh is privileged to suffer for His body—His spiritual body, the Church’; and explains that this supplementing of Christ’s sufferings is ‘not in their sacrificial efficacy but their ministerial utility.’ ‘The Church is built up by repeated acts of self-denial in successive individuals and successive generations.’ So we see the old fire of the first captivity is burning up still more ardently as the end draws near. ‘The salvation which is in Christ Jesus’ is for him at hand; the faith is kept. What still he can, that he will, do and bear, that their salvation also may be assured; and <span class="ital">that</span> Timothy <span class="ital">his son</span> will surely also both practise and preach.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sakes</span>] R.V. gives ‘sake,’ perhaps better as the interest of the whole Church ‘the one body’ was one and the same. Otherwise, the plural may still be used, as e.g. in ‘for all your sakes.’ ‘Sake’ is the same as the German ‘sache,’ ‘res,’ ‘thing,’ ‘account,’ ‘cause at law.’ Cf. the phrase ‘for old sake’s sake.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that they may also obtain</span>] The ‘also’ is intended in the English of a.d. 1611 to qualify ‘they’ as well as the verb; in the more precise English of a.d. 1881 R.V. writes ‘they also.’ So the looser use of ‘also’ has been altered <a href="/matthew/26-71.htm" title="And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.">Matthew 26:71</a>, ‘this fellow was also with Jesus,’ into ‘this man also was with Jesus.’ The more exact use two verses later ‘thou also art one of them,’ shews that the A.V. translators exercised a literary freedom in the matter. The O.T. revisers have left <a href="/zechariah/8-21.htm" title="And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.">Zechariah 8:21</a> ‘I will go also.’ The N.T. revisers who have altered <a href="/mark/2-28.htm" title="Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.">Mark 2:28</a>, <a href="/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="Say I these things as a man? or said not the law the same also?">1 Corinthians 9:8</a> have not ventured to alter <a href="/john/12-26.htm" title="If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.">John 12:26</a>; <a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with eternal glory</span>] The thought is the same as in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <span class="ital">the affliction</span>, light and <span class="ital">for the moment</span>, worketh <span class="ital">glory</span>, an <span class="ital">eternal</span> weight of glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_timothy/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο</span>, <span class="ital">for this cause</span>) because the Gospel runs forward, while I am bound.—<span class="greekheb">σωτηρίας</span>—<span class="greekheb">μετὰ δόξης</span>, <span class="ital">salvation—with glory</span>) There is an exquisite propriety in the words: <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>, <span class="ital">salvation</span>, viz. the deliverance from evil, is the privilege of those receiving faith: <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, <span class="ital">glory</span>, viz. the abundance of good things, is the privilege of those reaching the goal, <a href="/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people.

It seems, therefore, rather to refer collectively to all the considerations which he had just been urging upon Timothy, perhaps especially the last, of the resurrection of Christ, which he now again enforces by his own example of willing suffering in order that the elect may obtain  the eternal salvation which is in Jesus Christ - adding, in vers. 11 and 12, the encouragement to suffering derived from the "faithful saying." <span class="cmt_word">I endure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>); the exact force of which is seen in the substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, patience, so frequently attributed to the suffering saints of God. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Therefore (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>Because I know that God is carrying on his work.<p>That they may also (&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>More correctly, they also may, etc. Also, as well as myself.<p>Obtain the salvation (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>The phrase N.T.o.
