If <span class= "ital">he</span> would separate from all that was evil in his Church at Ephesus, then would he indeed be one of those golden vessels unto honour. The image of the great house, and its many and varied vessels, though still not quite lost sight of, is passing out of sight. This verse changes into a note of direct exhortation. The good and faithful must separate themselves from the evil and faithless. The thought of those deniers of the resurrection of the body was uppermost in St. Paul’s mind. There must, as it has been well said, be no communion on the part of God’s servants with impugners of fundamentals. It was imperatively necessary for Timothy—and, by implication, for all members of Christ’s Church—if they aimed at becoming vessels for honour in the great Temple, to break off from all Church fellowship, from all intimate friendship, with those above referred to under the image of wooden or earthen vessels.<p><span class= "bld">He shall be a vessel unto honour.</span>—Chrysostom’s note upon these words is somewhat remarkable. He points out the possibility of the vessel for dishonour becoming a vessel for honour, and the reverse; and refers to St. Paul, once an earthen vessel, who became a vessel of gold, and to the traitor Judas, who, on the other hand, from being a vessel of gold became an earthen vessel.<p><span class= "bld">Meet for the master’s use.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">useful for the master</span> (of the house). “Useful,” as the next sentence shows us, through those good works by means of which others’ needs are ministered to, and the salvation of others is furthered, and the glory of God is increased.<p><span class= "bld">Prepared unto every good work.</span>—“Prepared”—that is, ready to take advantage of any opportunity which may offer itself to do a generous, noble action. So, too, Chrysostom, who would have the “vessel unto honour” ready for every emergency which would enhance the glory of the Lord—ready even for death, or (any painful) witness.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Those disposed to strive, commonly strive about matters of small moment. But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour - If a man "cleanse" or "purify" himself; compare the notes on <a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>.

St. Paul drops the metaphor. The general meaning is clear enough, that a man may become “heaven’s consummate cup,” <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος ἐκλογῆς</span> (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>), if he “mistake not his end, to slake the thirst of God”. When we endue the vessels with consciousness, it is seen that they may “rise on stepping-stones of their dead selves to higher things”. The <span class="greekheb">τις</span> has been, it is implied, among the “vessels unto dishonour”. “Paul was an earthen vessel, and became a golden one. Judas was a golden vessel, and became an earthen one” (Chrys.). Bengel supposes that the <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις</span> is an exhortation to Timothy himself. This is suggested in R.V. of <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, “But flee,” etc. The reference in <span class="greekheb">τούτων</span> is not quite clear. It is best perhaps to explain it of the false teachers themselves, “vessels unto dishonour,” rather than of their teaching or immoral characteristics, though of course this is implied. The thoroughness of the separation from the corrupting environment of evil company is expressed by the <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>- and <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span>. Where <span class="greekheb">ἐκκαθαίρω</span> occurs again, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, the metaphor (leaven) also refers to the removal of a corrupting personal element.

For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1 Corinthians 5:7</a> where the preposition gives the force ‘purge out from your houses the old leaven.’ Wordsworth forcibly notes here; ‘a man may <span class="ital">at one time</span> of his life be numbered among vessels to dishonour, and yet <span class="ital">may become</span> a vessel to honour, by cleansing himself out from their number and condition. Mark this assertion of Free Will.’ And again, ‘a Christian man may not <span class="ital">go out</span> of the <span class="ital">great house</span> which is the Visible Church of God: he cannot separate himself wholly from sinners, but he must cleanse himself from them <span class="ital">as sinners</span>; that is, he must not communicate with them <span class="ital">in their sins</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sanctified</span>] Or perhaps better ‘purified.’ ‘Sanctified’ belongs to metaphor, the implied Christian life and service; but <span class="ital">in form</span> the sentence remains a <span class="ital">simile</span> to the end. Hence R.V. rightly renders <span class="bld">the master’s use</span>, i.e. the master of the house, not with some printed copies of A.V. ‘the Master’s,’ which would imply an immediate reference to God. ‘Meet for use’ is the same word as in <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2 Timothy 4:11</a> ‘serviceable,’ and in <a href="/philemon/1-11.htm" title="Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:">Philemon 1:11</a>, where Onesimus formerly ‘unprofitable’ is ‘now profitable.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">prepared</span>] This word and ‘sanctified’ are both perfect passive participles, and are more expressive than our English can shew of the resulting final state reached.

The idea, therefore, seems to be that of <span class="accented">separation</span>, and, if so, "from these" may certainly mean from the false teachers described under the image of the vessels unto dishonour, as usually explained. At the same time, the image is better sustained if we understand "from these" to mean the babblings, and ungodliness, and eating words of the heretics denounced. It is hardly natural to imply that one vessel in the house will become a golden vessel by purging itself from the wooden and earthen vessels. Neither is separation from the false teachers the point which St. Paul is here pressing, but avoidance of false doctrines. <span class="cmt_word">Meet for...use</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and ch. 4:11 and <a href="/philemon/1-11.htm">Philemon 1:11</a>.
