The virtues here mentioned, our Lord generally exercised in teaching. Yet, on some occasions, he departed from his usual mildness, and with great severity reproved notorious sinners; such as the scribes and Pharisees. In the same manner, the prophets and apostles used strong speech in checking obstinate offenders; while those who showed any candour and honesty in their opposition to the truth, they instructed with the greatest meekness.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">That they may recover themselves</span> — Or rather, <span class="ital">may awake, </span>and deliver themselves; <span class="ital">out of the snare of the devil </span>— In which they have lain sleeping, and, as it were, intoxicated. “In order to understand this beautiful image,” says Doddridge,” it is proper to observe, that the word <span class="greekheb">ανανηψωσιν </span>properly signifies to <span class="ital">awake </span>from a deep sleep, or from a fit of intoxication, and refers to an artifice of fowlers to scatter seeds impregnated with some drugs intended to lay birds asleep, that they may draw the net over them with the greater security.” <span class="ital">Who are taken captive by him </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εζωγρημενοι</span>, <span class="ital">caught alive. </span>The word denotes the action of a fisher, or hunter, who takes his prey alive in order to kill it; which is properly applied to Satan’s insnaring men in order to destroy them. And the snares in which he takes them are those prejudices, errors, lusts, and vices, in which he entangles, and by which he detains them his captives, in the most shameful bondage, danger, and misery, while they have been dreaming, perhaps, of liberty and happiness. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:22-26 The more we follow that which is good, the faster and the further we shall flee from that which is evil. The keeping up the communion of saints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; which surely shows that religion consists more in believing and practising what God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach, who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, not persecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error. The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace brings us to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebel against it. There is no peradventure, in respect of God's pardoning those who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance to those who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And if any long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape, except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it of him by earnest, persevering prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid; - see the notes at <a href="/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>; compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>. The word "unlearned," here, means "trifling; that which does not tend to edification; stupid." The Greeks and the Hebrews were greatly given to controversies of various kinds, and many of the questions discussed pertained to points which could not be settled, or which, if settled, were of no importance. Such has been the character of no small part of the disputes which have agitated the world. Paul correctly says that the only effect of such disputes is to engender harsh contention. Points of real importance can be discussed with no injury to the temper; but people cannot safely dispute about trifles. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

The repetition of this precept of the apostle four times in these two short Epistles, lets us know how important a thing he judged it, that ministers of the gospel should not spend their time in their discourses to their congregations, in things that tend nothing to the building up of their hearers in faith or holiness, being either old wives’ fables, like the stories in the popish legends, or the apocryphal stories of Bel and the Dragon, Tobit and his dog, and the swallows dunging in his eye, &c.; or sifting out genealogies, or vain and impertinent discourses, or idle, fruitless questions, which tend not to edifying, but to satisfy curiosity, and increase strife and ungodliness; which kind of preaching the apostle also had defamed, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm" title="He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,">1 Timothy 6:4</a></span>, as the issue of pride, and ignorance, and dotage, and here he calls such questions <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">unlearned</span> in the same sense, because impertinent to the end of preaching.
