But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But shun profane and vain babblings, - see the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>.<p>For they will increase unto more ungodliness - Their tendency is to alienate the soul from God, and to lead to impiety. Such kinds of disputation are not merely a waste of time, they are productive of positive mischief. A man fond of contention in religious things is seldom one who has much love for the practical duties of piety, or any very deep sense of the distinction between right and wrong.

It makes very good sense to say, "Avoid these profane babblings, for they won't stop there - they will grow into open impiety and blasphemy." But ver. 17, as Alford observes, is in favour of the "teachers" being the subject of "will proceed;" but it is not conclusive. If a full stop be put after "ungodliness," as in the A.V., ver. 17 comes in quite naturally with the further statement that "their word will eat as doth a gangrene." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shun (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;)<p>Po.
