St. Paul has been urging Timothy to be strong in endurance, to bear trouble and suffering with brave patience. He now proceeds to charge him respecting the special work he has to do; and, first he deals with his duties as a teacher of truth brought face to face with teachers of error. He prefaces his directions by bidding him, in the forefront of his teaching, “put them” (that is, those over whom he was placed: the members of his Ephesian flock) “in remembrance of these things”—namely, of those great and solemn truths set forth in <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11-13</a>, and which may be briefly summed up in the words: “Fellowship with Christ in suffering will be succeeded by fellowship with Christ in glory.” Surely such lofty, soul-inspiring thoughts as these will form the best safeguard against the pitiful controversies and disputes about words, which were occupying the thoughts and wasting the lives of so many in Ephesus called by the name of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Charging them before the Lord.</span>—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">solemnly charging them before the Lord</span> . . . In all Timothy’s solemn addresses to his flock he is, St. Paul reminds him, charging his people “before the Lord”—a very earnest, solemn thought for every public teacher, and one calculated <span class= "ital">now, </span>as <span class= "ital">then, </span>to deepen the life of one appointed to such an office. There was a grave danger that such empty, profitless disputes about words and expressions, which, we know, occupied the attention of many of the Ephesian so called Christian teachers, would end in distracting the minds of the members of the several congregations, who would naturally take their tone, in matters connected with religious life, from their teacher; and thus words would soon come to be substituted for acts in the lives of those men and women called by the name of Christ in Ephesus. (See <a href="/1_timothy/6-4.htm" title="He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,">1Timothy 6:4</a>, where these “strifes of words” are mentioned among the special characteristics of the false teachers.)<p><span class= "bld">But to the subverting of the hearers.</span>—Not only are such arguments and disputes useless and profitless, but they are positively mischievous. In the long history of Christianity, St. Paul’s repeated warning respecting the danger of these disputes about theological terms and expressions has been sadly verified. Such contentions serve only to unsettle the mind, only to shake true faith, only to distract the one who gives himself up to this fatal pursuit, from real, earnest, patient work for Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Those disposed to strive, commonly strive about matters of small moment. But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of these things put them in remembrance - These great principles in regard to the kingdom of Christ.

De Wette and Wiesinger have declared themselves for the <span class="ital">Rec.</span>, because “the verb <span class="greekheb">διαμαρτ</span>. is commonly used by Paul for introducing exhortations, and is not in keeping with the weak appeal <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα ὑπομίμνησκε</span>.” These reasons, however, are not sufficient, since <span class="greekheb">διαμαρτ</span>. may quite as well be connected with what precedes as with what follows, although it does not occur elsewhere in the N. T. in such a connection; and <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα ὑπομ</span>. is not used by the apostle in so weak a sense that he could not strengthen it by such a form of adjuration. Nor can it be maintained that the exhortation <span class="greekheb">μὴ λογομάχει</span> is unsuitable for Timothy, since there is again at <a href="/2_timothy/2-16.htm" title="But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.">2 Timothy 2:16</a> an exhortation quite similar in nature; comp. also <a href="/2_timothy/2-23.htm" title="But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do engender strifes.">2 Timothy 2:23</a>. There is more force in Reiche’s observation: supervacaneum … fuisset, Timotheo, uno quasi halitu bis fere idem imperare, <span class="greekheb">μὴ λογομάχει</span>, and <a href="/2_timothy/2-16.htm" title="But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.">2 Timothy 2:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὰς δὲ</span> … <span class="greekheb">κενοφωνίας περιΐστασο</span>; but, on the other hand, <span class="greekheb">μὴ λογομάχει</span> is a suitable addition to the exhortation: <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα ὑπομίμνησκε</span>.

Discourage the new false teaching by precept and example. There is no need, however, that you should despair of the Church. It is founded upon a rock, in spite of appearances. Take a broad view of the case: the Church is not the special apartment of the Master from which things unseemly are banished; it is a great House with places and utensils for every need of life.
