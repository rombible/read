There was an <span class= "ital">inner</span> work to be accomplished, as well as an outer and more public protest to be made. He must fight with and conquer those lusts, passions, and desires which are more peculiarly tempting to those who are still in the meridian of life. That Timothy was not now in early manhood has been already shown. He was at this time, probably, between thirty and forty years of age. These youthful lusts are by no means to be limited to those varied and fatal excesses summed up in the Seventh Commandment. A victory over these, of course, is imperatively necessary for one who would be “of use” in the house of his God: but such a one must train himself to subdue other and far more subtle lusts than are included in these. He must be watchful and stamp down all covetousness, whether of rank or gold; all longing for empty shows; all pride, conceit, readiness to take offence; all the kindred forms of love of self.<p><span class= "bld">But follow righteousness, faith, charity.</span> See Note on <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1Timothy 6:11</a>, where the same charge occurs.<p><span class= "bld">Peace.</span>—This last, “peace,” must be joined with the words immediately following: “with them that call on the Lord,” &c.

The keeping up the communion of saints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; which surely shows that religion consists more in believing and practising what God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach, who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, not persecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error. The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace brings us to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebel against it. There is no peradventure, in respect of God's pardoning those who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance to those who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And if any long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape, except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it of him by earnest, persevering prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Flee also youthful lusts - Such passions as youth are subject to. On the word "flee," and the pertinency of its use in such a connection, see the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>. Paul felt that Timothy, then a young man, was subject to the same passions as other young men; and hence, his repeated cautions to him to avoid all those things, arising from his youth, which might be the occasion of scandal; compare the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-2.htm">1 Timothy 5:2</a>. It is to be remembered that this Epistle is applicable to other ministers, as well as to Timothy; and, to a young man in the ministry, no counsel could be more appropriate than to "flee from youthful lusts;" not to indulge for a moment in those corrupt passions to which youth are subject, but to cultivate the pure and sober virtues which become the ministerial office.<p>But follow righteousness, ... - compare the notes at <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>. The general meaning here is, that he was to practice all that is good and virtuous. He was to practice righteousness, or justice and equity, in all his dealings with men; faith, or fidelity in his duties; charity, or love to all men (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>); peace, or harmony and concord with all others. What virtues could be more appropriate for a minister of the gospel?<p>With them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart - That is, with all Christians, who are often characterized as those who call on the Lord; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; compare <a href="/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11</a>. In all his social contact with them, Timothy was to manifest the virtues above recommended. But not with them alone.

Flee&#8212;There are many lusts from which our greatest safety is in flight (Ge 39:12). Avoid occasions of sin. From the abstemious character of Timothy (1Ti 5:23) it is likely that not animal indulgences, but the impetuosity, rash self-confidence, hastiness, strife, and vainglory of young men (1Jo 2:14-16), are what he is here warned against: though the Spirit probably intended the warning to include both in its application to the Church in general.<p>also&#8212;Greek, "But"; in contrast to "every good work," 2Ti 2:21.<p>youthful&#8212;Timothy was a youth (1Ti 4:12).<p>righteousness&#8212;the opposite of "iniquity," that is, unrighteousness (2Ti 2:19; compare 1Ti 6:11).<p>peace, with, &c.&#8212;rather, put no comma, "peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (1Ti 1:5; Eph 6:5; Col 3:22).

The comma after ‘peace’ of R.V. has been inserted rightly; its omission (as in A.V. of a.d. 1611, though many printed copies have inserted it,) unites ‘peace’ entirely with what follows, and denotes, as Ellicott puts it, ‘not merely “peace” in the ordinary sense but “concordiam illam spiritualem” (Calvin) which unites together all who call upon (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>) and love their Lord’; but it makes an unbalanced and ugly sentence; and loses the very significance of the clause as following on <a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2 Timothy 2:21</a>.
