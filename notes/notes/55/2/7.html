Theophylact suggested because the preceding exhortations were in the form of metaphors, “he spake all things in an enigmatical form:” but surely these metaphors were the reverse of obscure, and did not seem to need for their comprehension any special enlightenment; if then we refer the words of this verse exclusively to what precedes, it will be best to understand the charge of St. Paul, “Consider what I say,” &c., as directing Timothy’s attention to the <span class= "ital">personal</span> application of each of the pictures, or metaphors. It seems, however, that the words “Consider,” &c., while referring to what he <span class= "ital">had</span> said, belong also to the far weightier words he was about to write in the next sentence (<a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2Timothy 2:8</a>). He is in this chapter exhorting Timothy to be strong in the faith in the face of many troubles. He has instanced to him earthly examples to show how success, even <span class= "ital">here, </span>depends on enduring perseverance, and is now passing on to set before him other and far higher inducements for him “to be strong;” and between the first set of arguments and the second he bids him “Consider what I say” (part has been said, but yet other and deeper things are to follow). God will five him power to grasp their meaning in all their depth.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 As our trials increase, we need to grow stronger in that which is good; our faith stronger, our resolution stronger, our love to God and Christ stronger. This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. All Christians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to their Captain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian must be to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that our good may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zeal about outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strive lawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, we must labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up to consider what they hear or read.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Consider what I say; - see the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/4-15.htm">1 Timothy 4:15</a>. The sense is "Think of the condition of the soldier, and the principles on which he is enlisted; think of the aspirant for the crown in the Grecian games; think of the farmer, patiently toiling in the prospect of the distant harvest; and then go to your work with a similar spirit." These things are worth attention. When the minister of the gospel thinks of his hardships, of his struggles against an evil world, and of his arduous and constant discouraging toil, let him think of the soldier, of the man who struggles for this world's honors, and of the patient farmer - AND be content. How patiently do they bear all, and yet for what inferior rewards!<p>And the Lord give thee understanding in all things - Enable you to see the force of these considerations, and to apply them to your own case. Such are often the discouragements of the ministry; so prone is the mind to despondency, that we need the help of the Lord to enable us to apply the most obvious considerations, and to derive support from the most plain and simple truths and promises. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Thou canst understand my meaning so as personally to apply it to thyself; for the Lord will give thee understanding when thou seekest it from Him "in all things."

The advice given by the apostle to Timothy, to be strong in the grace of Christ; to commit the doctrines of the Gospel to faithful and able men; and to endure hardness for the sake of it: as also the characters which he bore as a soldier, a runner in a race, or a wrestler, and an husbandman; and therefore must not expect ease and rest, but war, difficulties, toil, and labour; and likewise under what titles Christ was to be regarded; as his General, and Captain of salvation, that commanded him; as the righteous Judge, that held the prize and crown for which he was running; and the chief Shepherd, who would reward all his labours; and moreover, the glorious reward of grace itself, he might expect, as eternal life, when he had fought the good fight the crown of righteousness, when he had finished his course, or run his race; and a crown of glory that fades not away, when the chief Shepherd should appear: and by putting him upon the consideration of these things, he suggests, that they were matters of moment and importance, and would be of great use to him in assisting and encouraging his faith, amidst all trials and exercises; and whereas they were expressed in figurative terms, taken from the soldier, the runner in a race, and the husbandman, they might not at first view be so easy to be understood; and therefore he would have him think of them, and meditate upon them, and weigh them in his mind; as well as he would not have him take things upon trust from him, but examine them whether they were right or not; though he doubted not but that they would be found to be agreeable to the standard of truth: wherefore he prays as follows, <p>and the Lord give thee understanding in all things; in all the above things, and in all others; in all the doctrines and mysteries of grace, and in all the rules of conduct in life. No man has of himself an understanding in spiritual things; this is the gift of God; and where it is given there is need of an increase of it, and always of such a prayer for it. The Alexandrian copy, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, read, "the Lord will give thee", &amp;c, and so the words are a promise, an encouragement to Timothy, to consider well of these things; for he might assure himself, that, in so doing, God would give him more understanding in them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</span><p>(5) All these things cannot be understood, and much less practised, unless we ask of God and he gives us understanding.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/2-7.htm" title="Consider what I say; and the Lord give you understanding in all things.">2 Timothy 2:7</a>. As he has been expressing his exhortations in figurative gnomes, Paul thus continues: <span class="greekheb">νόει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὃ λέγω</span>] which does not refer immediately to the thoughts expressed, as Heydenreich, Matthies, and others think, but to the form of expression.

St. Paul in pressing home his lesson, passes from figures of speech to the great concrete example of suffering followed by glory. And as he has, immediately before, been laying stress on the certainty of reward, he gives a prominent place to <span class="greekheb">ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν</span>. Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, “Himself man” (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm" title="For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), is the ideal soldier, athlete, and field-labourer; yet One who can be an example to us. It is not the resurrection as a doctrinal fact (A.V.) that St. Paul has in mind, but the resurrection as a personal experience of Jesus Christ, the reward He received, His being “crowned with glory and honour, because of the suffering of death” (<a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>).

In the other passage, <a href="/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>, in which St. Paul distinctly alludes to our Lord’s human ancestry, the phrase <span class="greekheb">τοῦ γενομένου ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυεὶδ</span> has a directly historical and polemical intention, as expressing and emphasising the human nature of Christ in antithesis to His Divinity. Here <span class="greekheb">ἐκ σπερμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Δ</span>. merely expresses the fact of His humanity. We cannot affirm with certainty that the phrase has the Messianic import that <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of David</span> has in the Gospels.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου</span>: <span class="ital">The Gospel preached by me</span>.

The verity both of Christ’s humanity and of His resurrection was emphasised in the Gospel preached by St. Paul.

Paul says this, if you compare <a href="/2_timothy/2-6.htm" title="The farmer that labors must be first partaker of the fruits.">2 Timothy 2:6</a> with <a href="/2_timothy/2-5.htm" title="And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.">2 Timothy 2:5</a>.

Therefore from this seventh verse we may gather that a thought rather different is involved in this expression, which amounts to this:—Paul trained the mind of Timothy, <a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm" title="Why I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.">2 Timothy 1:6</a>; therefore fruits are chiefly due to him from Timothy. In this view, Paul does not openly require, as is necessary in addressing dull men, but by amphibology and enigma, that Timothy should ingenuously acknowledge and perform the duty; and this he does by three comparisons taken from the employment of the soldier, the wrestler, the husbandman.—<span class="greekheb">δῴη γὰρ σοι</span>, <span class="ital">for may</span> the Lord <span class="ital">give to thee</span>) The meaning is, <span class="ital">He will give;</span> there is thus a connection between <span class="ital">consider</span> and <span class="ital">for;</span> but affection adds the modus or <span class="greekheb">ἧθος</span> [see Append. on “Modalis Sermo.” Here the imperative <span class="ital">mood</span> expresses the <span class="ital">feeling</span>].—<span class="greekheb">ὁ Κύριος</span>, <span class="ital">the Lord</span>) Christ.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσι</span>, <span class="ital">in all things</span>) <span class="ital">He had</span> already <span class="ital">given</span> him understanding <span class="ital">in many things:</span> this being taken for granted, Paul says, <span class="ital">May He give it in all things</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">For the Lord shall give</span> for <span class="accented">and the Lord give</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Consider what I say.
