Onesiphorus, to whose house the Apostle prays the Lord to give mercy, had, early in this last imprisonment of St. Paul, arrived in Rome on matters connected probably with business. There he heard of the arrest of that great master whom he had known well in Asia, and sought him out in his prison. There is but little doubt that when St. Paul wrote this Epistle Onesiphorus’ death must have recently taken place, both from the terms of this verse—where mercy is prayed, not for him, but for his house—and also from the expression “in that day,” used in <a href="/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2Timothy 1:18</a>. There is something strangely touching in this loving memory of “one” who, in his trouble, did <span class= "ital">not</span> forsake him, but whose devotion was rather increased by his danger, and this <span class= "ital">one</span> faithful friend would never be able again to show his love to the prisoner, for God had called him home.<p><span class= "bld">For he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain.</span>—“He oft refreshed me” does not imply that he ministered only to the Apostle’s bodily needs when he was in prison, though the word, no doubt, includes this. But “he refreshed” him by frequent visits, by, no doubt, much anxious forethought in the matter of St. Paul’s deliverance from prison and bonds, by a noble disregard of the personal danger which he incurred by his open intimacy with a prisoner charged, as St. Paul must have been, with treason against the empire. “<span class= "ital">He</span> was not ashamed of my chain.” (See <a href="/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>, where “the chain” of another captivity is mentioned.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 The apostle mentions the constancy of Onesiphorus; he oft refreshed him with his letters, and counsels, and comforts, and was not ashamed of him. A good man will seek to do good. The day of death and judgment is an awful day. And if we would have mercy then, we must seek for it now of the Lord. The best we can ask, for ourselves or our friends, is, that the Lord will grant that we and they may find mercy of the Lord, when called to pass out of time into eternity, and to appear before the judgment seat of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus - The family of Onesiphorus - for so the word house is often used.

He was evidently of Asia, and is the only one who is mentioned from that region who had showed the apostle kindness in his trials. He is mentioned only in this Epistle, and nothing more is known of him. The record is entirely honorable to him, and for his family the apostle felt a warm interest on account of the kindness which he had showed to him in prison. The ecclesiastical traditions also state that he was one of the seventy disciples, and was ultimately Bishop of Corone. But there is no evidence of this. There is much force in the remark of the Editor of the Pictorial Bible, that "the pretended lists of the 70 disciples seem to have been made out on the principle of including all the names incidentally mentioned in the sacred books, and not otherwise appropriated."<p>For he oft refreshed me - That is, showed me kindness, and ministered to my needs.<p>And was not ashamed of my chain - Was not ashamed to be known as a friend of one who was a prisoner on account of religion.

His household would hardly retain his name after the master was dead, as Bengel supposes him to have been.

Who seems to have been one of Asia, and of Ephesus, and is an exception from the general apostasy, or from those that turned away from the apostle; and therefore he prays that the Lord would show mercy to his family; that he would give regenerating grace and mercy to such of them as were without it, or pardoning grace and mercy, or the great mercy of eternal life and salvation by Christ; and this doubtless was a prayer in faith, upon the promises of God, and upon instances and examples, in which God has remarkably shown mercy to the families of good men, who have faithfully served him, and abode in his interest in times of trouble; thus the house of Obed Edom was blessed for the sake of the ark, that was taken care of by them; the reasons of this prayer and good wishes follow: <p>for he oft refreshed me; both with his Christian visits, and spiritual conversation, which to the apostle, in the heat of his affliction and persecution, were like a fan in hot weather, cooling and reviving, as the word signifies; and also by supplying him with the necessaries of life, as food and raiment, or money to purchase them with. He answered to his name, which signifies, "one that brings profit": he is said to be one of the seventy disciples; See Gill on <a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a> and afterwards to be bishop of Corone: <p>and was not ashamed of my chain; the Syriac version adds, "with which I am bound"; in which he lay, or by which he was held, and led by a soldier; see <a href="/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16</a>. Onesiphorus was not ashamed of the apostle, though he was bound with a chain; nor was he ashamed of the cause for which he suffered: and the apostle proposes him to Timothy, as an example worthy of imitation, in those times of defection.

With these unfaithful Asiatics, Paul contrasts the faithfulness of Onesiphorus, probably that he might place an example before Timothy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δῴη ἔλεος ὁ κύριος τῷ Ὀνησιφόρου οἴκῳ</span>] <span class="greekheb">διδόναι ἔλεος</span> does not occur elsewhere in the N.

Onesiphorus is named only here and at <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm" title="Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.">2 Timothy 4:19</a>. Many expositors (also Hofmann) think that his household only is in both passages mentioned, because he was no longer in life. This opinion is confirmed by the way in which mercy is wished for him in <a href="/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2 Timothy 1:18</a> (de Wette).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul expressed such a wish because of the love that had been shown him; <span class="greekheb">ὅτι πολλάκις με ἀνέψυξε</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἀναψύχειν</span>, properly, “cool,” then “refresh, enliven” (<span class="ital">Od.</span> iv. 568: <span class="greekheb">ἦτορ</span>), occurring only here in the N.

De Wette, without ground, thinks that a bodily refreshment of meat and drink only is meant; it should rather be referred more generally to all proofs of love on the part of Onesiphorus. These were all the more precious to the apostle that they were given to him in his imprisonment, and proved that Onesiphorus was not ashamed of his bonds (<a href="/2_timothy/1-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;">2 Timothy 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2 Timothy 1:12</a>); this is expressed in the words that follow.

It is inferred from this expression, coupled with that in <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, that Onesiphorus himself was no longer living; and hence ver. 18 (where see note) is thought by some to be an argument for prayers for the dead. The inference, further strengthened by the peculiar language of ver. 18, though not absolutely certain, is undoubtedly probable. The connection between this and the preceding verse is the contrast between the conduct of Phygelus and Hermogenes and that of Onesiphorus. They repudiated all acquaintance with the apostle in his day of trial; he, when he was in Rome, diligently sought him and with difficulty found him. and oft refreshed him with Christian sympathy and communion, acting with no less courage than love. He was no longer on earth to receive a prophet's reward (<a href="/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>), but St. Paul prays that he may receive it in the day of Christ, and that meanwhile God may requite to his family the mercy he had showed to St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Refreshed me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">revived me</span>.
