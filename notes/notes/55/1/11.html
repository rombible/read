In all his deep humiliation, a solitary prisoner awaiting death, deserted by his friends, St. Paul, with solemn emphasis, rehearses the titles of dignity which, by his Master’s appointment, he possessed in the Christian Church. The poor prisoner, waiting his summons to a painful death, wished his last charge to go forth with all the authority of an Apostle, adding, however, in the next verse, that his present sufferings were entailed on him, owing to this very position in the Christian community to which his Master had called him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_timothy/1-11.htm" title="Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles....">2 Timothy 1:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Whereunto </span>— For proclaiming which good news; <span class="ital">I am appointed a preacher </span>— <span class="greekheb">Κηρυξ</span>, <span class="ital">a herald; </span>and <span class="ital">an apostle </span>— Invested with an extraordinary commission, and furnished with spiritual gifts to make me a successful <span class="ital">teacher of the Gentiles </span>— That is, of them chiefly. <span class="ital">For which </span>— Namely, my preaching to the Gentiles; <span class="ital">I suffer these things</span> — “By assigning his preaching salvation to the Gentiles through Christ, without obedience to the law of Moses, as the cause of his second bonds in Rome, he hath insinuated that the unbelieving Jews were active in getting him imprisoned, and tried for his life as a criminal.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Nevertheless — </span>Though my condition may seem infamous; <span class="ital">I am not ashamed </span>— Either of my doctrine or of my sufferings. <span class="ital">For I know whom I have believed </span>— That is, whose word and promise I have credited, and to whom I have trusted all my important concerns: I know his power, and love, and faithfulness; and am persuaded, fully satisfied, <span class="ital">he is able to keep that which I have committed to him </span>— <span class="greekheb">Την παραθηκην μου</span>, <span class="ital">my deposite, until that day </span>— Of final retribution; meaning, undoubtedly, his immortal soul, or his whole person, soul and body.

And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher - That is, I am appointed to make these truths known; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.
