Although the sense is a little obscured by the long parenthesis which intervenes, it seems clear that St. Paul’s expression of thankfulness was for his remembrance of the unfeigned faith of Timothy and Lois and Eunice (see <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2Timothy 1:5</a>). The whole passage might be written thus, “I thank God, whom I serve with the devotion of my forefathers with a pure conscience (as it happens that I have thee uppermost in my thought and prayers night and day, longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, in order that I may be filled with joy), when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith which is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice,” &c.<p><span class= "bld">Whom I serve from my forefathers.</span>—That is, with the devotion and love I have inherited as a sacred family tradition. St. Paul was here referring, not to the great forefathers of the Jewish race—Abraham, Isaac, and the patriarchs—but to the members of his own family, who, he states, were religious, faithful persons. Van Oosterzee strangely concludes: “Dass Paulus diese historische kontinuität der wahren Gottesverehrung in seinem geschlecht um so höher schätzt, da er selbst stirbt, ohne kinder zu hinterlassen!”<p><span class= "bld">With pure conscience.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">in pure conscience.</span> The spiritual sphere in which St. Paul, as a Jew first, then as a Christian, served God.

These unstudied words tell us something of the inner life of such a one as St. Paul, how ceaselessly, unweariedly he prayed, night as well as day. The object, too, of those constant prayers of St. Paul was not St. Paul but Timothy.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The promise of eternal life to believers in Christ Jesus, is the leading subject of ministers who are employed according to the will of God. The blessings here named, are the best we can ask for our beloved friends, that they may have peace with God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Whatever good we do, God must have the glory. True believers have in every age the same religion as to substance. Their faith is unfeigned; it will stand the trial, and it dwells in them as a living principle. Thus pious women may take encouragement from the success of Lois and Eunice with Timothy, who proved so excellent and useful a minister. Some of the most worthy and valuable ministers the church of Christ has been favoured with, have had to bless God for early religious impressions made upon their minds by the teaching of their mothers or other female relatives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers - Paul reckoned among his forefathers the patriarchs and the holy men of former times, as being of the same nation with himself, though it may be that he also included his more immediate ancestors, who, for anything known to the contrary, may have been distinguished examples of piety. His own parents, it is certain, took care that he should be trained up in the ways of religion; compare the <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-5</a> notes; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/26-4.htm">Acts 26:4-5</a>. The phrase "from my forefathers," probably means, after the example of my ancestors. He worshipped the same God; he held substantially the same truths; he had the same hope of the resurrection and of immortality; he trusted to the same Saviour having come, on whom they relied as about to come. His was not, therefore, a different religion from theirs; it was the same religion carried out and perfected.

I thank&#8212;Greek, "I feel gratitude to God."<p>whom I serve from my forefathers&#8212;whom I serve (Ro 1:9) as did my forefathers. He does not mean to put on the same footing the Jewish and Christian service of God; but simply to assert his own conscientious service of God as he had received it from his progenitors (not Abraham, Isaac, &c., whom he calls "the fathers," not "progenitors" as the Greek is here; Ro 9:5). The memory of those who had gone before to whom he is about to be gathered, is now, on the eve of death, pleasant to him; hence also, he calls to mind the faith of the mother and grandmother of Timothy; as he walks in the faith of his forefathers (Ac 23:1; 24:14; 26:6, 7; 28:20), so Timothy should persevere firmly in the faith of his parent and grandparent. Not only Paul, but the Jews who reject Christ, forsake the faith of their forefathers, who looked for Christ; when they accept Him, the hearts of the children shall only be returning to the faith of their forefathers (Mal 4:6; Lu 1:17; Ro 11:23, 24, 28). Probably Paul had, in his recent defense, dwelt on this topic, namely, that he was, in being a Christian, only following his hereditary faith.<p>that &#8230; I have remembrance of thee&#8212;"how unceasing I make my mention concerning thee" (compare Phm 4). The cause of Paul's feeling thankful is, not that he remembers Timothy unceasingly in his prayers, but for what Timothy is in faith (2Ti 1:5) and graces; compare Ro 1:8, 9, from which supply the elliptical sentence thus, "I thank God (for thee, for God is my witness) whom I serve &#8230; that (or how) without ceasing I have remembrance (or make mention) of thee," &c.<p>night and day&#8212;(See on [2492]1Ti 5:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Paul here by his <span class="bld">forefathers</span> either intends his immediate parents, or Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for he served the same God whom they served. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But how did Paul from his forefathers serve God <span class="ital">with pure conscience, </span> who was a native Jew, and zealous in that religion, in opposition to the faith of the gospel, which alone purifieth the heart? <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/15-9.htm" title="And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.">Acts 15:9</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Solution.</span> A pure conscience seemeth here to signify the same with <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/3-6.htm" title="Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.">Philippians 3:6</a></span>, <span class="ital">touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</span> Paul was strict to the rules of that religion which he professed, though that religion was not that which universally purifieth the heart.

After the inscription and salutation follows the preface to the epistle; which contains a thanksgiving to God upon Timothy's account, and has a tendency to engage his attention to what he was about to write to him in the body of the epistle. God is the object of praise and thanksgiving, both as the God of nature and providence, and as the God of all grace; for every good thing comes from him, and therefore he ought to have the glory of it; nor should any glory, as though they had not received it: and he is here described, as follows, <p>whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience; the apostle served God in the precepts of the law, as in the hands of Christ, and as written upon his heart by the Spirit of God, in which he delighted after the inward man, and which he served with his regenerated mind; and also in the preaching of the Gospel of Christ, in which he was very diligent and laborious, faithful and successful: and this God, whom he served, was the God of his "forefathers", of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of Benjamin, of whose tribe he was, and also of his more immediate ancestors. The Ethiopic version renders it, "from my original"; for though he preached the Gospel of Christ, and asserted the abrogation of the ceremonial law, yet he worshipped the one, true, and living God, the God of Israel, and was not an apostate from the true religion, as his enemies would insinuate: and this service of his was performed with a "pure conscience": every man has a conscience, but the conscience of every natural man is defiled with sin; and that is only a pure one, which is sprinkled and purged with the blood of Christ; and whereby a person is only fitted to serve the living God, without the incumbrance of dead works, and slavish fear, and with faith and cheerfulness; and such a conscience the apostle had, and with such an one he served God. For this refers not to his serving of God, and to his conscience, while a Pharisee and a persecutor; for however moral was his conduct and conversation then, and with what sincerity and uprightness soever he behaved, his conscience was not a pure one. He goes on to observe what he thanked God for, <p>that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; that God had laid him upon his heart, and that he had such reason to remember him at the throne of grace continually. We learn from hence, that the apostle prayed constantly night and day; and if so great a man as he stood in need of continual prayer, much more we; and that in his prayers he was not unmindful of his friends, though at a distance from him; and in both these he is to be imitated: it becomes us to pray without ceasing: to pray always, and not faint and give out, to pray every day and night; and to pray for others as well as for ourselves, for all the saints, yea, for our enemies, as well as for our friends. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> I thank God, whom I serve from <i>my</i> <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</span><p>(1) The purpose that he aims at in this epistle is to confirm Timothy to continue constantly and bravely even to the end.

The expression is only in <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1 Timothy 1:12</a> (elsewhere in the N.

To <span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span> there is next attached the relative clause: <span class="greekheb">ᾧ λατρεύω ἀπὸ προγόνων ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει</span>, which is added because the apostle wishes to remind Timothy of his <span class="greekheb">πρόγονοι</span>, viz. his grandmother and mother,—not to bring into prominence a relationship <span class="ital">different</span> from the apostle’s own (Hofmann), but one <span class="ital">corresponding</span> with his own.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ προγόνων</span> is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ βρέφους</span>, <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; it means that the apostle serves God “in the manner handed down by his progenitors, as they had done” (Buttmann, p. 277), or that the service of the <span class="greekheb">πρόγονοι</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> not the ancestors of the Jewish people (Heydenreich and others), but the progenitors of the apostle himself (so most expositors), is continued in him, and denotes therefore “the continuity of the true honouring of God by Judaism” (de Wette). Otto says that the expression is not to be referred to the education (Flatt) or disposition (Winer, p. 349 [E. T. p. 465]; van Oosterzee, Wiesinger), but to the ancestral mode of worship; but, in reply, it is to be observed, that on account of <span class="greekheb">ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει</span> the reference to disposition is by no means to be considered as excluded.[1] The apostle, by his conversion to Christianity, did not interrupt his connection with the <span class="greekheb">λατρεύειν</span> of his ancestors, because it was a necessary condition of the new faith to honour the God of revelation whom the Jews served. This utterance regarding the apostle himself, and particularly the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδ</span>., are not in contradiction with <a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.">1 Timothy 1:13</a> and similar passages, since the apostle, even while he was zealous for the law, served the God of his fathers <span class="greekheb">ἐν καθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνειδ</span>., as little then as afterwards falsifying the revealed word with arbitrary fictions, which was done by the heretics; comp. <a href="/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a> ff. Hofmann is wrong in breaking up the inner relation of these words, referring <span class="greekheb">λατρεύω</span> only to <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ προγόνων</span>, and not also <span class="greekheb">ἐν καθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνειδήσει</span>, which he refers only to the apostle.

The apostle, in his giving of thanks to God, often indeed recalls his <span class="greekheb">μνεία</span> of those to whom he writes (<a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Php 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,">Philemon 1:4</a>), but he never points them out as the ground of his thanksgiving. Otto, while granting that there are objections to it, wishes to take <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> as the same as <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, and to regard it as a particle of the <span class="ital">reason</span>, equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὕτως</span>, which, however, cannot be justified from usage.[3] Just as little should we take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span> adverbially with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΔΙΑΛ</span></span></span>. Mack: “I thank God, etc.… I keep right continually,” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A subordinate clause begins with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span>, which, however, does not mean: “since, quippe, siquidem” (Heydenreich, Flatt, Matthies: “in so far”), “so often” (Calvin: “quoties tui recordor in precibus meis, id autem facio continenter, simul etiam de te gratias ago”), but expresses the parallel relation of the subordinate clause to the principal one, and should be translated by “as” (Wiesinger, van Oosterzee); in <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span> has a very similar meaning. The sense accordingly is: “<span class="ital">I thank God, as I am continually mindful of thee in my prayers</span>,” so that already in the subordinate clause it is indicated that the thanksgiving to God refers to Timothy. In <a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> stands in quite another connection, which makes de Wette’s objection all the less justifiable, that here it has been taken from that passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΔΙΆΛΕΙΠΤΟΝ ἜΧΩ ΤῊΝ ΠΕΡΊ ΣΟΥ ΜΝΕΊΑΝ</span></span></span>] De Wette arbitrarily maintains that Paul would have said: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΔΙΑΛΕΊΠΤΩς ΜΝΕΊΑΝ ΣΟΥ ΠΟΙΟῦΜΑΙ</span></span></span>.

The first construction is preferable, because the chief emphasis is laid on the preceding thought, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΠΟΘῶΝ</span></span></span> being made subsidiary; besides, the apostle had no particular reason for directing attention to the uninterrupted duration <span class="ital">of his longing</span> for Timothy as the source of his unceasing prayer.

The consciousness is pure, when it is conscious of no impure strivings. Impurity appears whenever any one, under the pretence of serving God, follows after his own selfish purposes.” There is no ground for Hofmann’s assertion, that the <span class="greekheb">καθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνείδησις</span> is only “a conscience free from consciousness of guilt, such as only that man can have who is conscious of the forgiveness of his sins.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3] The particle <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> does sometimes occur in classic Greek in such a way that it is resolvable into <span class="greekheb">ὅτε οὕτως</span>; but, as is shown in the very nature of the word, only <span class="ital">in cases when</span> the sentence beginning with <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> expresses something <span class="ital">surprising</span>, something <span class="ital">exciting astonishment</span>, in particular, therefore, after the verb <span class="greekheb">θαυμάζω</span>. It follows, as Pape says, <span class="ital">s.v.</span>, that “in such cases we may translate it with the simple <span class="ital">how</span>.” That such is the case, is proved by all the quotations brought together by Otto (p. 301) from the Greek classics. It is therefore <span class="ital">entirely erroneous</span> for Otto to say quite generally that “it is in the manner of genuine Greek to contract the causal <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> with the following <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> into the adverbial pronoun <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>.” Only if the <span class="greekheb">ἀδιάλειπτον ἔχω τὴν περὶ σοῦ μνείαν</span> occurred to the apostle as something <span class="ital">strange, astonishing</span>, could <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> be explained here by <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὕτως</span>.—Besides, it is inaccurate for Otto to ascribe to <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> a causal signification, and then call the clause beginning with it an objective clause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;...">2 Timothy 1:3-7</a>.

For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.">Acts 26:7</a>. The service of the old covenant was true and real service so long as it was with a pure conscience and until the conscience was enlightened. Hence the force of the verb with its qualifying clauses in the very similar passage, <a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>, ‘God is my witness whom I serve in my spirit in the Gospel of His Son.’ The old service of sacrifice and ceremonial (‘the giving of the law and the service,’ <a href="/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a>) has given place to the ‘living sacrifice, the reasonable or spiritual service,’ <a href="/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>.

The structure of the chapter is evidently, ‘I am thy dear father in life and work; I am very thankful to have a dear son in my desolateness—to remember thee at all hours, and most and best in my prayers,—to count the days and nights till I shall see thee—to think of thy tears when I left thee—and so to hope for refreshing news of thy true and trusty faith, learnt like my own, at a mother’s knee. By all this that is between us—and yet more, by that gift of gifts to thee, the Grace of Orders, when these hands of mine were laid upon thy head, and my work was thine, O Timothy my son, play the man, the minister; the man of God, God’s minister; with me and after me.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in my prayers</span>] More precisely, <span class="bld">in my supplications</span>. See note on <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, from which we see that this word indicates a felt ‘want’ and a petition for its supply. St Paul sorely <span class="ital">wanted</span> strength and support for the last struggle, and Timothy could help him; so he prayed, not <span class="ital">in Timothys behalf</span> so much as for Timothy to come <span class="ital">in his behalf</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">night and day</span>] Variously taken, with ‘my prayers,’ as A.V., or with ‘longing to see thee’ (as R.V.). The phrase in the accusative, <a href="/luke/2-37.htm" title="And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.">Luke 2:37</a>, closes the sentence; in the genitive, as here, and <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, introduces it; in these latter passages the participles equally with ‘longing’ require emphasis and do not lose it by ‘night and day’ preceding; so that Dean Alford’s objection to following these here as precedent seems needless. ‘Greatly desiring’ seems a fair rendering of the verb alone, the preposition indicating in this case not ‘greatly,’ but ‘towards,’ ‘yearning towards.’ Render the clause <span class="bld">night and day longing to see thee</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3–7</span>.

For what does the apostle give thanks to God? The answer to this question will give the clue to the explanation. The only thing mentioned in the context which seer, s a proper subject of thanksgiving is that which is named in ver. 5, viz. the "unfeigned faith" that was in Timothy. That this was a proper subject of thanksgiving we learn from <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>, where St. Paul writes that, having heard of their faith in the Lord Jesus, he ceased not to give thanks for then-J, making mention of them in his prayers (see, too, <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). Assuming, then, that this was the subject of his thanksgiving, we notice especially the reading of the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "having received," and the note of Bengel that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means to be reminded of any one by another, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is used when any one comes to your recollection without external prompting; both which fall in with our previous conclusion. And we get for the main sentence the satisfactory meaning: "I give thanks to God that I have received (or, because I have received) a most pleasant reminder (from some letter or visitor to which he does not further allude) of your unfeigned faith," etc, The main sentence clearly is: "I thank God... having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee." The intermediate words are, in Paul's manner, parenthetical and explanatory. Being about to say that it was at some special remembrance of Timothy's faith that he gave thanks, the thought arose in his mind that there was a continual remembrance of him day and night in his prayers; that he was ever thinking of him, longing to see him, and to have the tears shed at their parting turned into joy at their meeting again. And so he interposes this thought, and prefaces it with <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> - not  surely, "how," as in the R.V., but in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, "as," "just as." And so the whole passage comes out: "Just <span class="accented">as</span> I have an unceasing remembrance of you in my prayers, day and night, longing to see you, that the tears which I remember you shed at our parting may be turned into joy, <span class="accented">so</span> do I give special thanks to God on the remembrance of your faith." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I thank God (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;)<p>Lit.
