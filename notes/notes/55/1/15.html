Instead of being dispirited by it, and by my arrest and close imprisonment, rather shouldest thou be stimulated to fresh and renewed exertions for the cause for which I suffer this desertion, these bonds.<p><span class= "bld">All they which are in Asia.</span>—It has been maintained by many, even by great Greek expositors such as Chrysostom, that “they which are in Asia” refers to certain Asiatic Christians who happened to be in Rome at the time of the Apostle’s arrest and imprisonment. Others have even suggested that these Asiatics had gone to Rome for the purpose of bearing witness in St. Paul’s favour, and finding that St. Paul’s position was one of extreme danger, terrified for themselves—like others once before had been in the Christian story—lest they too should be involved in a like condemnation, forsook him and fled. But the simple and more obvious meaning is here to be preferred, and we assume as certain that the forsaking, the giving up St. Paul, took place in Asia itself. Large numbers of Christians, if not whole churches, repudiated their connection with the great father of Gentile Christianity, and possibly disobeyed some of his teaching. What, in fact, absolutely took place in Asia while St. Paul lay bound, waiting for death in Rome, had been often threatened in Corinth and in other centres. Party feeling ran high in those days, we know; and one of the most sorrowful trials the great-hearted St. Paul had to endure in the agony of his last witnessing for his Lord, was the knowledge that his name and teaching no longer was held in honour in some of those Asian churches so dear to him. The geographical term Asia is rather vague. It may—and indeed, strictly speaking, does—include Mysia, Phrygia, Lydia, Caria; but such a wide-spread defection from Pauline teaching seems improbable, and there is no tradition that anything of the kind ever took place. St. Paul probably wrote the term more in the old Homeric sense, and meant the district in the neighbourhood of the river Cayster;<p>“In Asian meadow by Cayster’s streams.”<p><span class= "ital">—Iliad</span> ii. 461.<p><span class= "bld">Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</span>—These names would at once suggest to Timothy the men and the congregations of “Asia” to whom St. Paul was alluding—names well known, doubtless, then, and especially to persons in the position of Timothy; but no tradition has been preserved which throws any light on the lives and actions of these traitorous friends of St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This you know, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes....">2 Timothy 1:15-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">This thou knowest </span>— Of this thou hast received information; <span class="ital">that all they which are in Asia </span>— He appears to mean those of Asia who were known to him by a profession of Christianity, and who had attended him at Rome for a while; <span class="ital">are turned away from me </span>— And have proved treacherous friends, after all their forward pretences.

The name Asia was often given particularly to that part of Asia Minor; see the notes at <a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>; <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. This passage proves that Timothy was somewhere in that region when this Epistle was written to him, for otherwise he could not be supposed to Know what is here said. When Paul says that "all" were turned away from him, he must use the word in a general sense, for he immediately specifies one who had been faithful and kind to him.<p>Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes - We know nothing of these individuals but what is here mentioned. It would seem that they were prominent persons, and those from whom the apostle had a right to expect other treatment. "The ecclesiastical traditions allege that they were of the seventy disciples, and in the end became followers of Simon Magus. We imagine that this is little more than conjecture." It is a sad thing when the only record made of a man - the only evidence which we have that he ever lived at all - is, that he turned away from a friend, or forsook the paths of true religion. And yet there are many men of whom the only thing to be remembered of them is, that they lived to do wrong. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. all they which are in Asia&#8212;Proconsular Asia; "all who are there now, when they were in Rome (not 'be' or 'are,' but) turned from me" then; were "ashamed of my chain," in contrast to Onesiphorus; did not stand with me but forsook me (2Ti 4:16). It is possible that the occasion of their turning from him was at his apprehension in Nicopolis, whither they had escorted him on his way to Rome, but from which they turned back to Asia. A hint to Timothy, now in Asia, not to be like them, but to imitate rather Onesiphorus, and to come to him (2Ti 4:21).<p>Phygellus and Hermogenes&#8212;specified perhaps, as being persons from whom such pusillanimous conduct could least be expected; or, as being well known to Timothy, and spoken of before in conversations between him and Paul, when the latter was in Asia Minor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This thou knowest:</span> probably as to some he had a personal knowledge of their apostacy, as to others he knew it by information, which Paul confirmeth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That all they which are in Asia be turned away from me:</span> it seemeth unreasonable to interpret <span class="ital">all</span> here of every individual, but many, as all oft signifieth in holy writ.

The apostle reminds Timothy of those who had deserted him. This is done to incite Timothy to come to Rome with the greater speed, and also not to be ashamed of Paul, the prisoner of Christ, as the others had been (<a href="/2_timothy/1-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;">2 Timothy 1:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἶδας τοῦτο</span>] expresses not the probability merely (as Matthies says), but the certainty that he knows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἀπεστράφησάν με</span>] The aorist passive has here the force of the middle voice; for the same construction, comp. <a href="/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm" title="See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:">Hebrews 12:25</a>; see Wahl on the passage, and Buttmann, p. 166. The word does not denote the departure of any one, but is equivalent to aversari, properly, “turn one’s countenance away from any one,” and so “throw off inwardly the acquaintance of any one” (so in the N. T., in the LXX., the Apocrypha of the O. T., and the classical writers; comp. Otto, p. 283). Without reason, de Wette denies that it has this meaning here. There is therefore in the verb no ground for the common opinion that the <span class="greekheb">πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ</span> had been with Paul in Rome, and had again returned to Asia (Matthies, de Wette, Wiesinger). Nor is there more ground in the term used for the subject; <span class="greekheb">πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ</span> are “all who are in (proconsular) Asia;” but, as a matter of course, that cannot mean all the Christians there. Perhaps Paul was thinking only of his colleagues who were then residing in Asia (Otto); but in that case he would surely have designated them more precisely. It is possible that the construction has its explanation in the addition <span class="greekheb">ὧν ἐστιν Φύγελλος καὶ Ἑρμογένης</span>, viz.: “all the Asiatics, to whom belong Phygellus and Hermogenes.” In any case, these two are named because they were the most conspicuous in their unfaithfulness to the apostle. Paul gives no hint of it, and we can hardly think it probable that they were heretics, and that the other Asiatics had also fallen away from the truth (Otto).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This you know, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.">2 Timothy 1:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἶδας τοῦτο</span>: There is a personal appeal for loyalty in this reminder.

If it had been even approximately true, Timothy would have had no church to administer. On the other hand, something less serious than apostasy from the faith may be alluded to, such as personal neglect of the apostle (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.">2 Timothy 4:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">πάντες με ἐγκατέλειπον</span>, and the contrast of Onesiphorus’ conduct with theirs in the next verse), a thing which to us who see St. Paul through the halo of centuries of veneration seems painfully hard to understand. But it is abundantly plain that apostles did not during their lifetime receive that universal and unquestioning reverence from their fellow-Christians which we would have antecedently supposed could not have been withheld from them. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/3_john/1-9.htm" title="I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.">3 John 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ</span>: Asia means the Roman province, which included Mysia, Lydia, Caria, great part of Phrygia, the Troad, and the islands off the coast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This statement is most naturally explained of a defection in Asia of natives of Asia. Plummet conjectures that St. Paul had applied by letter from Rome for help to some leading Asiatic Christians, and had been refused. Of course it is possible that St. Paul refers to something that had taken place in Rome (so Bengel, who compares char. <a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.">2 Timothy 4:16</a>). But <span class="ital">all who are in Asia</span> would be a strange way of referring to some Asiastics who had been in Rome and had returned to Asia; and though <span class="greekheb">οἶδας τοῦτο</span> is naturally understood as mentioning something of which Timothy had knowledge only by report, we cannot be sure that St. Paul intended here to distinguish <span class="greekheb">οἶδας</span> from <span class="greekheb">γινώσκεις</span>. Perhaps the defection had taken place during an absence of Timothy from Asia. Nothing else is known certainly of Phygelus and Hermogenes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_timothy/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">all they which are in Asia be turned away</span>] Omit ‘be’; the tense describes a definite act, not a continuing state. We are left to conjecture when and where this desertion took place. ‘They which are in Asia’ implies the residents in Asia, but the desertion may have been either in Asia, between the first and second imprisonments, or in Rome: perhaps the former more probably, on the ground that Timothy’s knowledge of it is appealed to, as also is his knowledge of Onesiphorus’ service <span class="ital">at Ephesus</span>, while the help rendered by Onesiphorus at Rome is spoken of independently. The ‘Asia’ meant is the Roman province according to most Commentators (Howson, <span class="ital">Dict. Bib</span>.) which embraced Lydia, Mysia, Caria, and Phrygia, as distinguished from ‘Asia Minor’ commonly so called and from the continent of Asia. Lewin however (<span class="ital">Life and Epistles of St Paul</span>, 1. p. 190) identifies the Asia of N.T. with Lydia alone, i.e. from the Caicus to the Mæander, with the plain of the Cayster within it, which Homer calls ‘the Asian Meadow,’ cf. <span class="ital">Il</span>. 11. 461, Virg. <span class="ital">Georg</span>. 1. 383, ‘Asia … prata Caystri’; and he makes three strong points: (1) that the ‘Mysia of <a href="/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a> seems clearly separated there <span class="ital">from</span> ‘Asia’; (2) that ‘<span class="ital">the</span> seven churches which are in Asia’ on this hypothesis just cover the whole district; (3) that ‘the dwellers in Asia’ of <a href="/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,">Acts 2:9</a> heard their own language, not <span class="ital">three</span> languages, Lydian, Mysian and Carian.

The use of the aorist here is important, as St. Paul does not mean to say that the Churches of Asia had all forsaken him, which was not true, and which it would be absurd to inform Timothy of if it were true, living as he was at Ephesus, the central city of Asia, but adverts to some occasion, probably connected with his trim before Nero, when they shrank from him in a cowardly way. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> means "the whole party in Asia" connected with the  particular transaction to which St. Paul is alluding, and which was known to Timothy though it is not known to us. Perhaps he had applied to certain Asiatics, whether Christians or Jews or GraecoRomans, for a testimony to his orderly conduct in Asia, and they had refused it; or they may have been at Rome at the time, and avoided St. Paul; and among them Phygelus and Hermogenes, whose conduct may have been particularly ungrateful and unexpected. Nothing is known of either of them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In Asia<p>Proconsular Asia, known as Asia Propria or simply Asia. It was the Romans province formed out of the kingdom of Pergamus, which was bequeathed to the Romans by Attalus III((b.c. 130), including the Greek cities on the western coast of Asia, and the adjacent islands with Rhodes. It included Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia. The division Asia Major and Asia Minor was not adopted until the fourth century a.d. Asia Minor (Anatolia) was bounded by the Euxine, Aegean, and Mediterranean on the north, west, and south; and on the east by the mountains on the west of the upper course of the Euphrates.<p>Have turned away (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Not from the faith, but from Paul. </body></html>
