It is likely that the clouds of danger which were gathering thickly round St. Paul towards the close of his career had oppressed the brave-hearted Apostle with a foreboding of coming evil, and had invested the last parting with Timothy with circumstances of unusual solemnity. St. Paul had affected others besides Timothy with the same great love, so that tears were shed by strong men when he bade them farewell. (See the account of the leave-taking of the Ephesian elders at Miletus, <a href="/context/acts/20-37.htm" title="And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,">Acts 20:37-38</a>—“And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him, sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more.”)<p>There is no necessity for Hofmann’s singular, but rather far-fetched, theory here that the tears were simply an expression for Timothy’s intense sorrow at hearing of the Apostle’s arrest and close imprisonment, which sorrow St. Paul was made acquainted with in a letter. The tears, according to Hofmann, were those “welche Timotheus brieflich geweint hat.”<p><span class= "bld">That I may be filled with joy.</span>—When he meets Timothy again.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The promise of eternal life to believers in Christ Jesus, is the leading subject of ministers who are employed according to the will of God. The blessings here named, are the best we can ask for our beloved friends, that they may have peace with God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Whatever good we do, God must have the glory. True believers have in every age the same religion as to substance. Their faith is unfeigned; it will stand the trial, and it dwells in them as a living principle. Thus pious women may take encouragement from the success of Lois and Eunice with Timothy, who proved so excellent and useful a minister. Some of the most worthy and valuable ministers the church of Christ has been favoured with, have had to bless God for early religious impressions made upon their minds by the teaching of their mothers or other female relatives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Greatly desiring to see thee; - see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a>. It was probably on, account of this earnest desire that this Epistle was written. He wished to see him, not only on account of the warm friendship which he had for him, but because he would be useful to him in his present circumstances; see the introduction, Section 3.<p>Being mindful of thy tears - Alluding probably to the tears which he shed at parting from him. The occasion to which he refers is not mentioned; but nothing is more probable than that Timothy would weep when separated from such a father and friend. It is not wrong thus to weep, for religion is not intended to make us stoics or savages.<p>That I may be filled with joy - By seeing you again. It is easy to imagine what joy it would give Paul, then a prisoner, and forsaken by nearly all his friends, and about to die, to see a friend whom he loved as he did this young man. Learn hence, that there may be very pure and warm friendship between an old and young man, and that the warmth of true friendship is not diminished by the near prospect of death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. desiring&#8212;Greek, "with yearning as for one much missed."<p>mindful of thy tears&#8212;not only at our parting (Ac 20:37), but also often when under pious feelings.<p>that I may be filled with joy&#8212;to be joined with "desiring to see thee" (Ro 1:11, 12; 15:32).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There was a great brotherly love amongst primitive Christians, so as the apostle often expresseth his desire to see such Christians as were at a distance from him, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a> <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a></span>; but he expresseth aparticular reason of his desire to see Timothy, remembering the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">tears</span> he shed at his parting from him and the rest, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/20-37.htm" title="And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,">Acts 20:37</a>,38</span>; besides the desire he had by his presence to satisfy him, and give him occasion of <span class="bld">joy, </span> with which he also should be <span class="bld">filled; </span> unless he speaketh of the joy he promised himself when he saw Timothy, upon his seeing the improvement he had made both of his graces and gifts in the ministerial office. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_timothy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Greatly desiring to see thee,.... In his former epistle he had desired him to stay at Ephesus, there being some work for him to do, which made it necessary he should continue; but now having answered the apostle's purpose, and he standing in need of him at Rome, being without any assistant there, some having left him, and others were left by him in other places, and others were sent by him elsewhere; and it having been some time since he saw Timothy, he longed for a sight of him: <p>being mindful of thy tears; shed either at the afflictions and sufferings of the apostle, of which Timothy, being his companion, was an eyewitness, and he being of a truly Christian sympathizing spirit, wept with those that wept; or at their parting from each other, as in <a href="/acts/20-37.htm">Acts 20:37</a><p>that I may be filled with joy; at the sight of him, and not at the remembrance of his tears; for the last clause is to be read in a parenthesis, and these words stand not connected with that, but with the preceding part of the text. The apostle intimates, that a sight of his dearly beloved son Timothy would fill him with joy amidst all his troubles and afflictions he endured for the Gospel: this is an instance of hearty, sincere, and strong affection. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2 Timothy 1:4</a>.

The participle <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθῶν</span> is subordinate to the previous <span class="greekheb">ἔχω</span>; to it, in turn, the next participle <span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος</span> is subordinated. The longing for Timothy causes him to be continually remembered in the apostle’s prayers, and the remembrance is nourished by thinking of his tears.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σου τῶν δακρύων</span>] By these are meant—as the verb <span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος</span> shows—not tears which “Timothy shed” when at a distance from the apostle (Wiesinger), and of which he knew only through a letter (which Timothy therefore “shed by letter,” Hofmann); but the tears of which he himself had been witness, the tears which Timothy shed probably on his departure from him (van Oosterzee, Plitt). These were, to the apostle, a proof of Timothy’s love to him, and produced in him the desire of seeing Timothy again, that he might thereby be filled with joy. In this connection of the clauses with one another, the apostle has not yet given the object of thanks appropriate to the <span class="greekheb">χάριν ἔχω</span>; he does not do so till <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2 Timothy 1:5</a>.[4]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to Hofmann, the reason of the thanks is already given in the participial clause <span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος</span>. But the idea that Paul thanks God for Timothy’s tears, is out of all analogy with the other epistles of the apostle. Even the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα χαρᾶς πληρωθῶ</span> is against this view, for the apostle could not possibly say that he remembers Timothy’s tears in order that he may be filled with joy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4] Against this view it cannot be maintained that it makes a subordinate participle <span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος</span> depend on the subordinate participle <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθῶν</span>, for that is not in itself impossible; nor can it be said “that the insertion of a clause <span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος</span> between <span class="greekheb">ἰδεῖν σε</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is intolerable,” since the chief stress is not on <span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος</span>, but on <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθῶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Further, it cannot provoke objection that Timothy’s tears nourished in the apostle the longing to see him again, since these were a proof of his love—and of his faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2 Timothy 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος</span>—<span class="greekheb">δακρύων</span>: Parenthetical. St. Paul’s longing was made keener by his recollection of the tears Timothy had shed at their last parting. So Chrys. fixes the occasion. We are reminded of the scene at Miletus, <a href="/acts/20-37.htm" title="And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,">Acts 20:37</a>. Bengel, comparing <a href="/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>, thinks that reference is rather made to an habitual manifestation of strong emotion.

It seems very awkward to insert this clause as a subordinate parenthesis ‘with a faint causal force,’ ‘longing to see thee, as I remember thy tears in order that I may be filled with joy’; but this must be the effect of R.V. rendering. And again there is difficulty in either rendering of the participle in <span class="ital"><a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2 Timothy 1:5</a></span> with this construction; (1) A.V. ‘when I call to remembrance’ present, whereas we ought to read the aorist (2) R.V. ‘having been reminded,’ implying that there had been some occasion or messenger to give such news, of which we have at least no other hint. It is better to follow Drs Westcott and Hort in putting a comma after ‘tears’ and joining <a href="/context/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;...">2 Timothy 1:4-5</a> thus, ‘that I may be filled with joy in being reminded.’ The thought underlying this phrase ‘to be filled with joy,’ ‘to have one’s joy fulfilled,’ is, as Dr Westcott puts it in <a href="/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1 John 1:4</a>, that the fulfilment of Christian joy depends upon the realisation of fellowship. This fellowship may be <span class="ital">with</span> bodily presence, as <a href="/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.">2 John 1:12</a>; <a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>; or <span class="ital">without</span>, as <a href="/john/15-11.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.">John 15:11</a>; <a href="/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>; <a href="/john/17-13.htm" title="And now come I to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.">John 17:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1 John 1:4</a>, ‘these things we write that our joy may be fulfilled.’ The joy of the apostle is secured by his ‘little children’ realising full fellowship. Similarly the thought here is an echo of St Paul’s feelings expressed 5 or 6 years before to his Philippian ‘beloved ones,’ and the expressions are an echo too. Through that letter ran the theme ‘gaudeo: gaudete’; in that, with a wonderful tenderness and delicacy St Paul shews them that ‘unity,’ ‘brotherly love,’ is ‘the one thing lacking’ to perfect their joy: the one thing that to hear of or see in them will fulfil <span class="ital">his</span> too. Compare <a href="/context/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,...">Php 1:3-8</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,...">Php 2:1-2</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm" title="Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.">Php 4:4</a>. Through this letter runs the theme ‘fidem servavi: serva’; and with the same considerate love St Paul makes the appeal to his timid son to be ‘strong in the faith’ turn first on the <span class="ital">fulfilment of his own joy</span> which will result.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The final conjunction ‘in order that’ depends then formally on ‘I give thanks in my supplications,’ really on the whole affectionate yearning and praying spirit of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;...">2 Timothy 1:3-4</a></span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_timothy/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2 Timothy 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπιποθῶν σε ἰδεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">earnestly desiring to see thee</span>) He begins his invitation to Timothy at first gradually.—<span class="greekheb">μεμνημένος σου τῶν δακρύων</span>, <span class="ital">remembering thy tears</span>) He seems not merely to speak of the former tears of Timothy shed at bidding Paul farewell (for tears are usually elicited at parting, comp. <a href="/acts/20-37.htm" title="And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,">Acts 20:37</a>), but of his habitual tears under the influence of pious feeling.
