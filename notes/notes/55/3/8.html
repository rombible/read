No child of Israel could hear the name of Moses, the loved hero of the chosen people, unmoved; and to be told that these false teachers of Ephesus stood in the same relation to him and the Church of Christ as, in old days—in the never-to-be-forgotten Egyptian episode—those famous magicians Jannes and Jambres stood to Moses, would throw for Timothy a new light on all the words and works of these wicked and ambitious men. We can well imagine the comparison being repeated in many an assembly of the faithful, long after the great Apostle’s death: how St. Paul had likened these early Heresiarchs to those evil men who before Pharaoh had dared to resist God and His servant Moses. These magicians, also termed wise men and sorcerers (<a href="/context/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11-22</a>) at the court of Pharaoh, appear as the enemies of Moses. The names “Jannes” and “Jambres,” though not given in the sacred text, are preserved in the oral tradition of Israel. The names are found in the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a>. These traditions relate how these men were sons of Balaam, and in the first instance were the instructors of Moses, though subsequently his enemies and opponents. One legend mentions them as perishing in the catastrophe when the waves of the Red Sea overwhelmed the armies of Egypt; another tradition speaks of their having met their death in the slaughter after the worship of the golden calf, the making of which they advised. It was their prophetic words, so say these legendary histories, which, foretelling the birth of Moses, induced Pharaoh to give this order for the destruction of the Jewish children. The later Jews distorted the names into John and Ambrose.<p><span class= "bld">So do these also resist</span> <span class= "bld">the truth.</span>—The point of comparison between the depraved teachers of Ephesus and these Egyptian sorcerers consisted in a persistent and deadly enmity to the truth, which existed in both cases. The life of the prophet Balaam, the traditionary father of this Jannes and Jambres, supplies a vivid illustration of this malignant and persistent hatred of what is known and felt to be true. That these Ephesian heretics in like manner availed themselves, or pretended to avail themselves of occult power is just probable, though in the comparison this point is of but little moment. We know, however, that the claim at least to possess mysterious and unearthly powers was often made by covetous and worldly men in these times: as, for instance, by Simon Magus (<a href="/context/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9-24</a>), by Elymas the sorcerer, the false prophet and Jew in Cyprus (<a href="/context/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6-12</a>). See also the episode of <a href="/context/acts/19-18.htm" title="And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.">Acts 19:18-20</a>, when “many which used curious arts came to Paul and his companions, and confessed and shewed their deeds.”<p><span class= "bld">Men of</span> <span class= "bld">corrupt minds.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">corrupted in their minds.</span> Timothy might possibly have been induced to regard these evil men, though erring in some particulars, as still of the flock of Christ, to which they belonged nominally; but he was now instructed that they were simply enemies to the truth: that it was vain to hope that they would ever come to a knowledge of the truth, for their “mind,” the human spirit, the medium of communication with the Holy Spirit of God, was corrupted. There was no common ground of faith, save in the bare name of Christian, between Timothy and these men, for they, in the matter of faith, had been tried and found wanting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith....">2 Timothy 3:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now as Jannes and Jambres </span>— Some ancient writers speak of these persons as the chief of Pharaoh’s magicians, whose names, though not recorded by Moses, yet being handed down by tradition, are preserved in Jonathan’s Chaldee Paraphrase on <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>; <span class="ital">withstood Moses </span>— We learn from <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-22.htm" title="And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he listen to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 7:22</a>, that Pharaoh’s magicians imitated three of Moses’s miracles by their enchantments; that is, by repeating a form of words known only to themselves, in which they invoked certain demons, and, as they fancied, constrained them to do the things desired.

That is, “the vile arts by which the corrupters of Christianity established their errors being discovered, their folly and wickedness shall be very plain to the people, even as the folly and wickedness of Pharaoh’s magicians were made plain to the Israelites, by the stop which God put to their enchantments. And thus, the truth being set in a more clear light, the wisdom and righteousness of God, in permitting these corruptions to take place for a while, will be demonstrated.” They who are acquainted with the history of the ancient heretics, and of the Romish Church, and of the Reformation, need not be informed how exactly this whole prophecy hath been fulfilled.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account of persecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within. Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses - The names of these two men are not elsewhere mentioned in the Bible. They are supposed to have been two of the magicians who resisted Moses (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, et al.), and who opposed their miracles to those of Moses and Aaron. It is not certain where the apostle obtained their names; but they are frequently mentioned by the Hebrew writers, and also by other writers; so that there can be no reasonable doubt that their names were correctly handed down by tradition. Nothing is more probable than that the names of the more distinguished magicians who attempted to imitate the miracles of Moses, would be preserved by tradition; and though they are not mentioned by Moses himself, and the Jews have told many ridiculous stories respecting them, yet this should not lead us to doubt the truth of the tradition respecting their names. A full collection of the Jewish statements in regard to them may be found in Wetstein, in loc.<p>They are also mentioned by Pliny, Nat. Hist. 30:7; and by Numenius, the philosopher, as quoted by Eusebius, 9:8, and Origen, against Celsus, p. 199. See Wetstein. By the rabbinical writers, they are sometimes mentioned as Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses in Egypt, and sometimes as the sons of Balaam. The more common account is, that they were the princes of the Egyptian magicians. One of the Jewish rabbins represents them as having been convinced by the miracles of Moses, and as having become converts to the Hebrew religion. There is no reason to doubt that these were in fact the leading men who opposed Moses in Egypt, by attempting to work counter-miracles. The point of the remark of the apostle here, is, that they resisted Moses by attempting to imitate his miracles, thus neutralizing the evidence that he was sent from God. In like manner, the persons here referred to, opposed the progress of the gospel by setting up a similar claim to that of the apostles; by pretending to have as much authority as they had; and by thus neutralizing the claims of the true religion, and leading off weak-minded persons from the truth. This is often the most dangerous kind of opposition that is made to religion.<p>Men of corrupt minds; - compare the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5</a>.<p>Reprobate concerning the faith - So far as the Christian faith is concerned.

The margin here is, "of no judgment." The meaning is, that in respect to the Christian faith, or the doctrines of religion, their views could not be approved, and they were not to be regarded as true teachers of religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Eusebius [Preparation of the Gospel], quotes from Numenius, "Jannes and Jambres were sacred scribes (a lower order of priests in Egypt) skilled in magic."

These were not Jews, who rose up and opposed Moses, as Dathan and Abiram did, as some have thought; but Egyptian magicians, the chief of those that Pharaoh sent for, when Moses and Aaron came before him, and wrought miracles; and who did in like manner by their enchantments, <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a> upon which place the Targum of Jonathan has these words: <p>"and Pharaoh called the wise men and the magicians; and Janis and Jambres, the magicians of the Egyptians, did so by the enchantments of their divinations.'' <p>And the same paraphrase on <a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15</a> calls them by the same names; and this shows from whence the apostle had these names, which are not mentioned in any place in the Old Testament; namely, from the traditions and records of the Jews, with which he was well acquainted: there is no need to say he had this account by divine revelation, for some of the Heathens had knowledge of this story some such way. Numenius; the philosopher, speaks of Jannes and Jambres as Egyptian scribes, and famous for their skill in the magic art; and who opposed themselves to Moses when the Jews were driven out of Egypt (l). Pliny also makes mention of Janme and Jotape as magicians; though he wrongly calls them Jews, and places Moses with them (m), as Jannes likewise is by Apuleius (n). It is commonly said by the Jews (o), that these were the two sons of Balaam, and they are said to be the chief of the magicians of Egypt (p); the latter of these is called in the Vulgate Latin version Mambres; and in some Jewish writers his name is Mamre (q) by whom also the former is called Jochane or John; and indeed Joannes, Jannes, and John, are the same name; and R. Gedaliah (r) says, that their names in other languages are John and Ambrose, which is not unlikely. Mention is made of the sons of Jambri in the Apocrypha: <p>"But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it.'' (1 Maccabees 9:36) <p>whom Josephus (s) calls the sons of Amaraeus. These are said to be the persons that told Pharaoh, that a child should be born among the Israelites, by whom the whole land of Egypt should be destroyed, and which was the reason of Pharaoh's giving such a charge to the Hebrew midwives (t); also the making of the golden calf is ascribed to them (u); for, according to the Jews, they afterwards became proselytes; but these things are not to be depended on: however, certain it is, that they withstood Moses by their enchantments, and hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that, for a while, he would not let the children of Israel go. Now between these magicians, and the Papists before described, there is a very great agreement; as these men were Egyptians, so the Papists may be called, since Rome is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, <a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a> as the one were, so the other are idolaters, who worshipped devils, idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, <a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a> and both sorcerers, using the magic art; <a href="/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a> and they both pretended to miracles; though what they did were no other than lying wonders, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a> and both agreed to keep the people of God in bondage, as much, and as long as they could: and particularly, as the magicians of Egypt withstood Moses, <p>so do these also resist the truth; the truth of one God, by their worshipping of images; and of one Mediator, by making use of angels, and saints departed, to intercede with God for them; and of justification by the righteousness of Christ, by introducing the doctrine of works, of merit, and supererogation; and of pardon and cleansing by the blood of Christ, and atonement by his sacrifice, by their pardons, indulgences, penance, purgatory, and the sacrifice of the Mass; yea, they resist the Scriptures of truth, not allowing them to be a sufficient rule without their unwritten traditions, and even Christ, who is truth itself, in all his offices, prophetic, priestly, and kingly. <p>Men of corrupt minds, of bad principles, holding antichristian tenets, derogatory to the grace of God, and glory of Christ; giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; like Jannes and Jambres, who were given to magic arts, and were under the influence of Satan: <p>reprobate concerning the faith; men of no judgment in the doctrine of faith; who have not their senses exercised to discern good and evil, to try things that differ, and approve the more excellent, but call good evil, and evil good: or as those who are disobedient and wicked in their lives, are said to be to every good work reprobate, <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a> so these are said to be reprobate to the faith; that is, to have no liking of it, or value for it, but despise it, hate it, and reject it; and upon that account, as they are like reprobate silver, whom God has rejected, they ought to be rejected by men. <p>(l) Apud Euseb.

Evangel</span>. ix. chap. 8) inform us. “According to Jewish tradition, they are said to have been the sons of Balaam, and at first the teachers of Moses, but afterwards his chief opponents, and to have perished at last with the Egyptian army in the Red Sea;” see Heydenreich and Wetstein on this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The correlation of <span class="greekheb">ὃν τρόπον</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὕτω</span> does not necessarily place emphasis on the similarity of the <span class="ital">manner</span> of the act, but often only on the similarity of the act itself (comp. <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="/acts/7-28.htm" title="Will you kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?">Acts 7:28</a>). Possibly, therefore, the heretics are compared with these sorcerers only because they both withstood the truth (so Plitt).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Possibly, also, it is because the resemblance lay in the heretics preaching the same thing as Timothy, just as the sorcerers did the same thing as Moses, the heretics and the sorcerers having the same purpose of striving against the truth (so Hofmann). Still the mention of the sorcerers at all is strange; hence we may suppose that the heretics by some more characteristic trait suggested the resemblance to the apostle’s mind, and that this trait was their use of magic arts, to which there is allusion made also in <span class="greekheb">γόητες</span>, <a href="/2_timothy/3-13.htm" title="But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.">2 Timothy 3:13</a> (de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee[49]).

The apostle now returns from the <span class="greekheb">γυναικάρια</span> to their seducers, whom he compares to the magicians who withstood Moses and Aaron, both in their hostility to the truth and in their subsequent fate. St. Paul is the earliest extant authority for the names; but of course he derived them from some source, written (Origen), or unwritten (Theodoret), it is immaterial which. But the former theory is the more probable. The book is called by Origen (<span class="ital">in Matt</span>. p. 916, on <a href="/matthew/27-8.htm" title="Why that field was called, The field of blood, to this day.">Matthew 27:8</a>), <span class="ital">Jannes et Mambres liber</span>, and is perhaps identical with <span class="ital">Pœnitentia Jamnis et Mambrae</span> condemned in the <span class="ital">Decretum Gelasii</span>. Pliny, whose <span class="ital">Natural History</span> appeared in A.D. 77, mentions Jannes along with Moses and Lotapis (or Jotapis) as Jewish Magi posterior to Zoroastes (<span class="ital">Hist. Nat</span>. xxx. 1). He is followed by Apuleius, <span class="ital">Apol</span>. c. 90. Numenius (quoted by Eusebius (<span class="ital">Prep. Ev</span>. ix. 8) mentions Jannes and Jambres as magicians who resisted Moses. In the Targ. of Jonathan on Ex. vii. 11, the names are given as <span class="greekheb">ינים וימברים</span>, Janis and Jamberes; but in the Talmud as <span class="greekheb">יחנא וממרא</span>, Jochana and Mamre. It is generally agreed that Jannes is a form of Jochanan (Johannes), and that Jambres is from the Hiphil of <span class="greekheb">מרה</span> to rebel.

The <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> refers rather to the degree of their hostility than to the manner in which it was expressed, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, by magical arts.

Pliny, <span class="ital">Hist.

There must have been an oral tradition or a lost book of Israelitish early history. Mr Poole (Art. <span class="ital">Dict. Bib</span>. from which this account is mainly taken) inclines to the latter supposition as more likely to preserve the exact names. That they are exact he thinks probable; since (1) the termination in Jambres or Mambres is like that of many Egyptian compounds ending with ra “the Sun,” as Men-kau-ra, (2) Jannes appears to be a transcription of the Egyptian name Aan, that of a king of the 15th dynasty who was probably the second predecessor of Joseph’s Pharaoh, and the most prevalent names among the Egyptians were those of kings then reigning or not long dead. The Rabbins state that Jannes and Jambres were sons of Balaam, and prophesied to Pharaoh the birth of Moses, and were authors of much mischief, subsequently perishing either in the Red Sea or in the tumult over the golden calf.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">resist the truth</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">withstand</span>, keeping the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of corrupt minds</span>] Implies too much a <span class="ital">natural</span> viciousness; the perfect passive participle implies ‘having come to a corrupt state and remaining in it’ as above. <span class="ital">In itself</span> the word ‘corrupt’ from the Latin participle (cf. the Vulg. ‘corrupti mente)’ should have just this force, but in usage it is a mere adjective; render <span class="bld">corrupted in mind</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">reprobate</span>] Just as in <a href="/titus/1-16.htm" title="They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.">Titus 1:16</a>, where see note.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_timothy/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.">2 Timothy 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰαννῆς καὶ Ἰαμβρῆς</span>, <span class="ital">Jannes and Jambres</span>) Euseb., <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,">2 Timothy 1:9</a>, Præp.
