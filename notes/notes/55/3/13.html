History has borne witness to the accuracy of these prophetic words. The false teachers known to St. Paul and Timothy developed into the leaders of the various wild and speculative Gnostic sects, whose connection with Christianity consisted alone in the name; and each succeeding age has witnessed <span class= "ital">a development</span> in opposition to the truth as it is in Jesus. In this allusion to the gradual development of hostility to the truth it will hardly be out of place to instance the eighteenth Christian century, when opposition to the teaching of Jesus had reached such a pitch that, with the approval or even the applause of thousands, the most brilliant writer in Europe wrote of Christ and His religion in the well-known words, “Ecrasez l’infame!” while it was reserved for our own century—the nineteenth—to witness the rare, though we believe ephemeral popularity, among so-called Christian peoples of a work which, with honeyed phrases, and in romantic, graceful language, paints the Redeemer of man in the strange and apparently contradictory characters of a loving enthusiast and of a conscious impostor!<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:10-13 The more fully we know the doctrine of Christ, as taught by the apostles, the more closely we shall cleave to it. When we know the afflictions of believers only in part, they tempt us to decline the cause for which they suffer. A form of godliness, a profession of Christian faith without a godly life, often is allowed to pass, while open profession of the truth as it is in Jesus, and resolute attention to the duties of godliness, stir up the scorn and enmity of the world. As good men, by the grace of God, grow better, so bad men, through the craft of Satan, and the power of their own corruptions, grow worse. The way of sin is down-hill; such go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. Those who deceive others, deceive themselves, as they will find at last, to their cost. The history of the outward church, awfully shows that the apostle spake this as he was moved by the Holy Ghost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse - That is, it is the character of such men to do this; they may be expected to do it. This is the general law of depravity - that if men are not converted, they are always growing worse, and sinking deeper into iniquity. Their progress will be certain, though it may be gradual, since "nemo repente turpissimus." The connection here is this: that Timothy was not to expect that he would be exempt from persecution <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>, by any change for the better in the wicked men referred to. He was to anticipate in them the operation of the general law in regard to bad men and seducers - that they would grow worse and worse. From this fact, he was to regard it as certain that he, as well as others, would be liable to be persecuted. The word rendered "seducers" - &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  goe&#772;s - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, a "juggler, or diviner;" and then, a "deceiver, or impostor." Here it refers to those who by seductive arts, lead persons into error.<p>Deceiving - Making others believe that to be true and right, which is false and wrong. This was, of course, done by seductive arts.<p>And being deceived - Under delusion themselves. The advocates of error are often themselves as really under deception, as those whom they impose upon. They are often sincere in the belief of error, and then they are under a delusion; or, if they are insincere, they are equally deluded in supposing that they can make error pass for truth before God, or can deceive the Searcher of hearts. The worst victims of delusion are those who attempt to delude others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

By "evil men" are meant, not sinful men in common, as all are by nature and practice; nor only open profane sinners but rather wicked men under a form of godliness, as before; and who are full of wickedness and malice against truly godly persons, even as the devil himself, of whom the same word is used, when he is called the wicked one; and this is a reason why true professors of religion must expect persecution, seeing as there ever were, so there ever will be such sort of men, who will not grow better, but worse and worse. The word for "seducers", signifies sorcerers, enchanters, a sort of jugglers; and as the other, it well suits with the ecclesiastics of the church of Rome, who pretend to miracles, and do lying wonders, and by their sorceries deceive all nations, <a href="/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a> and these "shall wax worse and worse"; in principle and in practice, in ungodliness, and in error, in wickedness and malice against the saints, and in the arts of deceiving; so the church of Rome is never to be expected to be better, but worse; at the time of the fall of Babylon she will be an habitation of devils, the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird, <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a><p>deceiving: not God, but themselves and others even all nations, excepting the elect of God; which they do by their good words and fair speeches, and by their show of devotion and religion, and by their pretended miracles and lying wonders: <p>and deceived by the old serpent, the devil, under whose power and influence they are, in whose snare they are taken, and by whom they are led captive, and will at last share the same fate with himself, and be cast into the same lake of fire and brimstone. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But evil men and seducers shall wax <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</span><p>(d) Their wickedness will daily increase.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/3-13.htm" title="But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.">2 Timothy 3:13</a>. Matthies (with whom Wiesinger agrees) thus states the connection between this and the preceding verses: “Quite different is it with evil men, who, instead of suffering for the truth, proceed always farther in their wickedness;” but there is no real opposition in the two thoughts thus opposed.[52] The apostle here continues the description of the heretics which was interrupted at <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2 Timothy 3:10</a>; in contrast with <span class="greekheb">οἱ θέλοντες εὐσεβῶς ζῆν</span>, he calls them <span class="greekheb">πονηροὶ ἄνθρωποι καὶ γόητες</span>, and says of them, <span class="greekheb">προκόπτειν ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον</span>, which is all the more suitable that it was the very reason why persecution was threatening the honest disciples of Christ, and with them Timothy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πονηροὶ δὲ ἄνθρωποι</span>] As the article is wanting, the thought is quite general, but <span class="greekheb">καὶ γόητες</span> clearly shows that the heretics mentioned above are specially meant (in opposition to Hofmann). Paul gives this name to the heretics, with reference to <a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.">2 Timothy 3:8</a>, where he compared them to the Egyptian <span class="ital">sorcerers</span>.

Even the meaning of <span class="greekheb">πλανώμενοι</span> is against the parallel, for it is neither transitive: “leading astray” (Matthies), nor middle: qui se seducendos permittunt (Bengel), nor even intransitive: “going astray” (Hofmann); it is purely passive: “being led astray” (Luther), or otherwise it would have been put first. He who leads others astray is himself led astray.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[52] Wiesinger argues, on the other hand, that “suffering for the sake of holiness, and advance in wickedness with outward success,” do form a contrast; but the idea “with outward success” is entirely imported.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/3-13.htm" title="But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.">2 Timothy 3:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">πονηροὶ δὲ</span>: The antithesis seems to be between the apparent discomfiture of those who wish to live in Christ (their persecution being after all almost a means conditional to their attaining their desire), and the paradoxical success of evil men; they advance indeed; but only in degradation; <span class="ital">proficient in peius</span> (Vulg.).

R.V. in these places varies between ‘seduce’ and ‘lead astray.’ The word so rendered here is properly ‘enchanter,’ from the cries of incantations used.
