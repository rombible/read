and so are without the affections natural to mankind. At least they dare not avow their having these affections. It may likewise be meant of the laity, who shut up their female children in nunneries, on pretence of superior sanctity; but in reality from interested motives.” <span class="ital">Truce, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">covenant breakers </span>— For this sin the Roman Catholic clergy have been remarkable, having not long ago professedly held it as a principle of religion, that no faith is to be kept with heretics; and having set subjects free from their oaths of allegiance to their princes. But <span class="greekheb">ασπονδοι </span>may signify persons who, being offended, will enter into no treaty of reconciliation, and so may be translated <span class="ital">implacable, </span>as in <a href="/romans/1-31.htm" title="Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:">Romans 1:31</a>. <span class="ital">False accusers </span>— Or <span class="ital">slanderers, </span>as <span class="greekheb">διαβολοι </span>may be properly rendered; in which, as the word implies, they will imitate that diabolical malignity which renders the great enemy of mankind so justly odious. Thus the Romish clergy have imputed all manner of crimes to those who have resisted their corruptions. <span class="ital">Incontinent </span>— Or <span class="ital">intemperate </span>in their pleasures. <span class="ital">Fierce </span>— Against their opposers, and in their resentments cruel in their revenge. <span class="ital">Despisers of</span> <span class="ital">those that are good </span>— That is, of those who maintain the truth, and are real followers of Christ. Or, as <span class="greekheb">αφιλαγαθοι </span>may be translated, <span class="ital">without love to goodness, </span>or <span class="ital">good men. Traitors </span>— To those that place the greatest confidence in them; yea, such base traitors as to give up their brethren into the hands of persecutors, and even their nearest relations, who oppose their corrupt practices, to death. <span class="ital">Heady </span>— Rash in enterprising things which can only issue in the disturbance of society, or the ruin of those that undertake them. <span class="ital">High-minded </span>— Puffed up with such insolence and self-sufficiency as to despise any remonstrance which can be made to bring them to a wiser and more decent conduct. <span class="ital">Lovers of pleasure </span>— Namely, sensual pleasure, <span class="ital">rather than lovers of God </span>— And who will therefore sacrifice all considerations of religion to the gratification of their appetites. Indeed, the love of pleasure naturally extinguishes all sense of God and love to him. “It is observable, that the apostle’s description begins with mentioning extreme selfishness as the root, and concludes with the excessive love of sensual pleasure as the end, of all the corruptions that were to prevail in the latter times. Hence we may learn what a pernicious thing the excessive love of sensual pleasure is! It has been the source of those monstrous perversions of religion which took place among Christians in the dark ages. And, governed by it, many, in every age, destroy their health, their fortune, their reputation, the comfort of their families, and every thing valuable in life, for the sake of gratifying their appetites.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Having a form </span>— Or appearance; <span class="ital">of godliness </span>— In observing with exactness the rituals and external ordinances of religion, but not regarding, nay, even <span class="ital">denying </span>and blaspheming <span class="ital">the </span>inward <span class="ital">power </span>and reality of it. A prediction too evidently fulfilled even at this day and that not only among the Papists. <span class="ital">From such — </span>Even from all in whom thou discernest a temper like that here described; <span class="ital">turn away </span>— Avoid all intimacy with them, lest they should avail themselves of it as an advantage for doing further mischief. Let it therefore evidently appear that thou givest them no countenance. Or, as some would render the original expression, <span class="greekheb">τουτους αποτρεπου</span>, <span class="ital">these turn away; </span>that is, turn out of the church all teachers who have any resemblance to the persons I have mentioned. For they are introducing the corruptions which, in after times, their successors will carry to the height I have described.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account of persecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within. Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Without natural affection - see the notes at <a href="/romans/1-31.htm">Romans 1:31</a>.<p>Trucebreakers - The same word in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-31.htm">Romans 1:31</a>, is rendered "implacable;" see the notes at that verse. It properly means "without treaty;" that is, those who are averse to any treaty or compact. It may thus refer to those who are unwilling to enter into any agreement; that is, either those who are unwilling to be reconciled to others when there is a variance - implacable; or those who disregard treaties or agreements. In either case, this marks a very corrupt condition of society. Nothing would be more indicative of the lowest state of degradation, than that in which all compacts and agreements were utterly disregarded.<p>False accusers - Margin, "makebates." The word "makebate" means one who excites contentions and quarrels. Webster. The Greek here is &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  diaboloi - "devils" - the primitive meaning of which is, "calumniator, slanderer, accuser;" compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm">1 Timothy 3:11</a>, where the word is rendered "slanderers."<p>Incontinent - <a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>. Literally, "without strength;" that is, without strength to resist the solicitations of passion, or who readily yield to it.<p>Fierce - The Greek word used here - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ane&#772;meros - does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means "ungentle, harsh, severe," and is the opposite of gentleness and mildness. Religion produces gentleness; the want of it makes men rough, harsh, cruel; compare the notes at <a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>.<p>Despisers of those that are good - In <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm">Titus 1:8</a>, it is said of a bishop that he must be "a lover of good men." This, in every condition of life, is a virtue, and hence, the opposite of it is here set down as one of the characteristics of that evil age of which the apostle speaks. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. truce-breakers&#8212;rather as the Greek is translated in Ro 1:31, "implacable."<p>false accusers&#8212;slanderers (1Ti 3:11; Tit 2:3).<p>incontinent, fierce&#8212;at once both soft and hard: incontinently indulging themselves, and inhuman to others.<p>despisers, &c.&#8212;"no lovers of good" [Alford]; the opposite of "a lover of good" (Tit 1:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Without natural affection; </span> having no kindness for such as nature obligeth them to love and honour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Truce-breakers; </span> men that will be held by no bonds or leagues.

The positive <span class="greekheb">φιλάγαθος</span>, <a href="/titus/1-8.htm" title="But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;">Titus 1:8</a>, has the same reference.

The threefold contrary spirit is in the same Sermon on the Mount, <a href="/luke/6-27.htm" title="But I say to you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,">Luke 6:27</a>, ‘<span class="ital">love</span> your enemies, <span class="ital">do good</span> to them that hate you, <span class="ital">bless</span> them that curse you.’ The word for ‘unloving’ occurs only in <a href="/romans/1-31.htm" title="Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:">Romans 1:31</a>, the other similarities of which seem to suggest that St Paul may have it in his mind, and be sadly tracing the decline and fall of Christian men back to the old heathen state.

'<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> at first merely expresses that anything was done, or any person was left, without such a truce. But, in a secondary sense, applied to a war, it meant an internecine war admitting of no truce; and thence, as here, applied to a person, it means "implacable," one who will make no truce or treaty with his enemy. The sense "truce breakers" is not justified by any example. <span class="cmt_word">Slanderers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); as <a href="/1_timothy/3-11.htm">1 Timothy 3:11</a> and <a href="/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>.

Used absolutely it means generally "without self-control, as here rendered in the R.V. The A.V. "incontinent" (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>) expresses only one part of the meaning (see <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fierce</span> (from <span class="accented">ferns</span>, wild, savage); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>; only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX., but frequent in the Greek tragedians and others, of persons, countries, plants, etc.; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "Beware of the Chalubes, for they are savage (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and cannot be approached by strangers" (AEschylus, 'Prom. Vinct.,' 734, edit. Scholef.). It corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, unmerciful (<a href="/romans/1-31.htm">Romans 1:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">No lovers of good</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and not at all in the LXX. or in classical Greek. But <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is found in Wisd. 7:22, and in Aristotle, in the sense of "lovers of that which is good;" and in <a href="/titus/1-8.htm">Titus 1:8</a>. The R.V. seems therefore to be right in rendering here "no lovers of good," rather than as the A.V. "despisers of those which are good," after the Vulgate and the new version of Sanctes Pagninus. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Without natural affection (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here and <a href="/romans/1-31.htm">Romans 1:31</a>. olxx.
