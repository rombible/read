He was to be ever watchful in all these things.<p><span class= "bld">Endure afflictions.</span>—And in his watch must Timothy be ready to suffer. He would remember what had been said before respecting a true Christian suffering (<a href="/context/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3-12</a>), and what was the high reward purposed for such brave endurance. He would remember, too, the hard and faithful life of his master, St. Paul (<a href="/context/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2Timothy 3:10-12</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Do the work of an evangelist.</span>—The “evangelists” of the early Church seem to have been preachers of the Gospel: in the first place, assistants to the Apostles and missionaries under their direction. The especial functions of a preacher and public teacher seem always to have been allotted to Timothy, and, no doubt, a peculiar persuasive power of oratory was one of the chief gifts conferred on this eminent follower of St. Paul. In the midst of the many grave and absorbing duties of his charge of the Ephesian Church, he must be mindful not to neglect this great power which he possessed. It is here especially termed “<span class= "ital">the work</span> of an evangelist,” to remind him that to perform rightly this duty, needed zeal, close work, much study, thought, and prayer; and it was by worthily performing the duties of an evangelist that the many who were turning from the truth to fables, would be best won back, by hearing the great facts of the Gospel placed side by side with the tables of the false teachers.<p><span class= "bld">Make full proof of thy</span> <span class= "bld">ministry.</span>—In other words, “Fully carry out the many duties imposed upon thee by thy great office.” The office of Timothy, it should be remembered, in Ephesus, included far more than merely those of a preacher or evangelist. He was the presiding presbyter of the Church, to whom its government was intrusted: in fact, the many-sided life of St. Paul was now to be lived by Timothy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry....">2 Timothy 4:5-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">But watch thou </span>— Both over thyself and flock, and withstand the beginnings of all these corruptions; let thy mind be awake and watchful; <span class="ital">in all things </span>— Whatever thou art doing, let this be thy earnest, constant, persevering exercise. Observe, reader, the Scripture <span class="ital">watching </span>or <span class="ital">waiting </span>implies steadfast faith, patient hope, labouring love, unceasing prayer; yea, the mighty exertion of all the affections of the soul that a man is capable of: <span class="ital">endure afflictions </span>— Or <span class="ital">adversity, </span>as <span class="greekheb">κακοπαθησον </span>signifies.

I have finished my course </span>— Of duty and of suffering: or, <span class="ital">I have finished the race; </span>for he likens his labour in the gospel not only to fighting and wrestling, but also to a race, which was likewise one of the Olympic exercises. <span class="ital">I have kept the faith </span>— Committed to my trust, and with the strictest fidelity have endeavoured to preserve it free from all additions and corruptions. <span class="ital">Henceforth </span>— <span class="greekheb">Λοιπον</span>, <span class="ital">what remains; there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness </span>— Namely, of that righteousness which God has imputed to me, and wrought in me, and enabled me to practise. Having compared his labours as an apostle to the exertions of the combatants, wrestlers, and racers, in the Grecian games, he represents his reward under the idea of a crown, because a crown was the reward bestowed on the victors in those exercises. It was not, however, a crown of leaves like theirs, but of righteousness, which he expected Christ to bestow on him, counting his faith to him for righteousness, and rewarding him for all the fruits brought forth by this righteousness. See on <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Php 1:11</a>. <span class="ital">Which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day </span>— This text evidently proves, that the great and most glorious reward of faithful Christians is referred to the day of general judgment. But, as Doddridge observes, “it would be very precarious to argue from hence, that there shall be no prelibation and anticipation of this happiness in a separate state. And when the many texts, which have been so often urged in proof of that intermediate happiness, are considered, it is surprising that any stress should be laid on the objection which has been drawn from such passages as this.” <span class="ital">And not to me only </span>— This increases the joy of Paul, and encourages Timothy; <span class="ital">but to all that love his appearing </span>— Which only a true Christian can do. Many of those Paul himself had gained, and he rejoiced to think, that through his having gained them, they should receive an unutterable and eternal reward of felicity and glory.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 People will turn away from the truth, they will grow weary of the plain gospel of Christ, they will be greedy of fables, and take pleasure in them.

The phrase here means, "do the work of preaching the gospel," or of one appointed to proclaim the glad tidings of salvation. This is the proper business of all ministers, whatever other rank they may maintain.

The word here used denotes, properly, to bear or bring fully; then to persuade fully; and then to make fully assured of, to give full proof of. The meaning here seems to be, "to furnish full evidence of what is the design of the Christian ministry, and of what it is adapted to accomplish," by the faithful performance of all its duties. Timothy was so to discharge the duties of his office as to furnish "a fair illustration" of what the ministry could do, and thus to show the wisdom of the Saviour in its institution. This should be the aim of all the ministers of the gospel. Each one should resolve, by the blessing of God, that the ministry, in his hands, shall be allowed, "by a fair trial," to show to the utmost what it is adapted to do for the welfare of mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Theodoret characterizes them in the well-known words: <span class="greekheb">πριΐοντες ἐκήρυττον</span>. They did not belong to a particular church like the <span class="greekheb">ποιμένες</span>, but travelled about like the apostles, preaching the Gospel to the Jews or heathen. They could lay no claim to authority in their office, since, as Otto rightly remarks (comp. too, Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, pp. 272 f.), they laboured not in consequence of an office committed to them, but by means of a <span class="greekheb">χάρισμα</span> imparted to them, as did also the <span class="greekheb">προφῆται</span>. It is incorrect to identify them with the assistant apostles. Philip was an evangelist (<a href="/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>), but not an assistant apostle. Timothy, Titus, and others were assistant apostles, and as <span class="ital">such</span>, evangelists only in the same sense in which the apostles themselves were evangelists; standing in closer relation to the apostles, they were their <span class="greekheb">συνέργοι</span> in all official duties, and all they did belonged to their <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> (so, too, Plitt).[58] As the <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζεσθαι</span> was Timothy’s chief vocation (as with the Apostle Paul, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>), the apostle exhorts him: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΡΓΟΝ ΠΟΊΗΣΟΝ ΕὐΑΓΓΕΛΙΣΤΟῦ</span></span></span>, adding the further exhortation: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ΔΙΑΚΟΝΊΑΝ ΣΟΥ ΠΛΗΡΟΦΌΡΗΣΟΝ</span></span></span>. This latter is not to be taken as a mere repetition of the preceding one, or as “only laying emphasis on the same thought by the use of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΡΟΦΌΡΗΣΟΝ</span></span></span>” (Wiesinger), since, as the whole of the first epistle testifies, his <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΑΚΟΝΊΑ</span></span></span> included more than the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΑΓΓΕΛΊΖΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> (which Hofmann wrongly denies[59]).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΡΟΦΟΡΕῖΝ</span></span></span>] synonymous here with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΡΟῦΝ</span></span></span>, which is even the reading of some MSS. Luther rightly: “execute;” see <a href="/colossians/4-17.htm" title=" And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.">Colossians 4:17</a>; <a href="/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>. Though <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΡΟΦΟΡΕῖΝ</span></span></span> in this sense is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἍΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΛΕΓ</span></span></span>., still it is well employed “to indicate the full measure of activity, in which not the least point may fail” (van Oosterzee). Beza’s exposition is too ingenious: ministerii tui plenam fidem facito, i.e. veris argumentis comproba te germanum esse dei ministrum.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] Wiesinger is wrong in thinking that Timothy’s office was only that of an evangelist, and therefore quite the same as Philip had, and that his labours beyond that in Ephesus did not belong to his <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span>. It is certain that his labours were done on the special commission of Paul; but it is incorrect to suppose that Paul commissioned him to do anything beyond his office.—Otto’s remark on the relation of the evangelists to the assistant apostles agrees in substance with what has been said above, only it might be more than doubtful that their preaching, as he thinks, was confined to an <span class="ital">account of Christ’s words and works</span>, that they were therefore only “heralds of the gospel <span class="ital">history</span>.”—Otto rightly says that the assistant apostles “represented the apostle in the entire range of his work.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[59] Hofmann, without reason, supposes that at the time when Paul wrote this epistle, and even before, Timothy was no longer an assistant to Paul in the apostleship.

The metaphorical sobriety is in effect ‘watchfulness,’ though not from ‘wakefulness’ so much as from ‘wariness,’ cool-headedness. Hence the proverb, ‘the tongue of the drunkard, but the heart of the sober.’ The present tense is plainly most suitable to this <span class="ital">state</span> of calm sober consideration in everything; while the aorists which follow as suitably express the going to and taking up ‘hardship,’ ‘preaching,’ ‘ministry,’ just as in <a href="/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;">2 Timothy 4:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the work of an evangelist</span>] Not here that of any separate class, but that which belonged to Apostles and the humblest Evangelists proper, equally.

The phrase is metaphorical, but it is uncertain whether the metaphor is that of a ship borne along by full sails, or of full measure given. If the former is the metaphor, then the derived meaning, when applied to persons, is that of full persuasion, entire and implicit faith, which carries men forward in a bold and unwavering course; or, when applied to things, that of being undoubtedly believed. But if the metaphor is taken from "bringing full measure;" then the sense in the passive voice when applied to persons will be "to be fully satisfied," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to have full assurance, and, when applied to things, "to be fully believed" (Liddell and Scott). Applying the last metaphor to the passage before us, the sense will be "discharge thy ministry to the fall."
