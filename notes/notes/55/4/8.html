The crown was the victory prize which the “good fight” of <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a> had won. It is called “the crown of righteousness,” it being the crown to which righteousness can lay claim—that <span class= "ital">is, </span>the crown awarded to righteousness.<p><span class= "bld">Which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me.</span>—As a righteous judge will the Lord award him the crown, recognising him as one who had the prize of victory. Not improbably, the expression “the righteous judge” was written in strong contrast to that unrighteous judge who had condemned Paul, and in accordance with whose unjust sentence he would presently suffer a painful death.<p><span class= "bld">At that day.</span>—This is the third time the words “that day” are used in this Epistle (see <a href="/context/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2Timothy 1:12-18</a>). The day of judgment is, of course, signified, the day when the Lord shall come again with glory.<p><span class= "bld">And not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</span>—Then St. Paul, instead of concluding this section of his letter with the glorious words telling of his serene courage and of his confidence in a crowned and immortal life, adds a gentle reminder to Timothy: <span class= "ital">he, </span>too, with any others who really look for the Second Coming of the Lord, might win the same glorious crown—the sure guerdon of righteousness. The Apostle specifies here exactly the persons for whom “the crown” was reserved—those who in this life have <span class= "ital">indeed</span> longed for the appearance of the Lord in judgment. None here could in very truth desire “His appearing,” save His own, who love Him and struggle to live His life. Calvin well remarks: “(St. Paul) excludes from the number of the faithful those to whom Christ’s coming is a source of terror.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 The blood of the martyrs, though not a sacrifice of atonement, yet was a sacrifice of acknowledgment to the grace of God and his truth. Death to a good man, is his release from the imprisonment of this world, and his departure to the enjoyments of another world. As a Christian, and a minister, Paul had kept the faith, kept the doctrines of the gospel. What comfort will it afford, to be able to speak in this manner toward the end of our days! The crown of believers is a crown of righteousness, purchased by the righteousness of Christ. Believers have it not at present, yet it is sure, for it is laid up for them. The believer, amidst poverty, pain, sickness, and the agonies of death, may rejoice; but if the duties of a man's place and station are neglected, his evidence of interest in Christ will be darkened, and uncertainty and distress may be expected to cloud and harass his last hours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Henceforth there is laid up for me - At the end of my race, as there was a crown in reserve for those who had successfully striven in the Grecian games; compare the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>. The word "henceforth" - &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  loipon - means "what remains, or as to the rest;" and the idea is, that that was what remained of the whole career. The race had been run; the conflict had been waged; and all which was now necessary to complete the whole transaction, was merely that the crown be bestowed.<p>A crown of righteousness - That is, a crown won in the cause of righteousness, and conferred as the reward of his conflicts and efforts in the cause of holiness. It was not the crown of ambition; it was not a garland won in struggles for earthly distinction; it was that which was the appropriate reward of his efforts to be personally holy, and to spread the principles of holiness as far as possible through the world.<p>Which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me - The Lord Jesus, appointed to judge the world, and to dispense the rewards of eternity. It will be seen in the last day that the rewards of heaven are not conferred in an arbitrary manner, but that they are bestowed because they ought to be, or that God is righteous and just in doing it. No man will be admitted to heaven who ought not, under all the circumstances of the case, to be admitted there; no one will be excluded who ought to have been saved.<p>At that day - That is, the time when he will come to judge the world; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>.<p>And not to me only - "Though my life has been spent in laboriously endeavoring to spread his religion; though I have suffered much, and labored long; though I have struggled hard to win the prize, and now have it full in view, yet I do not suppose that it is to be conferred on me alone. It is not like the wreath of olive, laurel, pine, or parsley (See the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>), which could be conferred only on one victor (See the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>); but here every one may obtain the crown who strives for it. The struggle is not between me and a competitor in such a sense that, if 'I' obtain the crown, 'he' must be excluded; but it is a crown which 'he" can obtain as well as 'I.' As many as run - as many as fight the good fight - as many as keep the faith - as many as love his appearing, may win the crown as well as I." Such is religion, and such is the manner in which its rewards differ from all others.<p>At the Grecian games, but one could obtain the prize; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. All the rest who contended in those games, no matter how numerous they were, or how skilfully they contended, or how much effort they made, were of course subjected to the mortification of a failure, and to all the ill-feeling and envy to which such a failure might give rise. So it is in respect to all the prizes which this world can bestow. In a lottery, but one can obtain the highest prize; in a class in college, but one can secure the highest honor; in the scramble for office, no matter how numerous the competitors may be, or what may be their merits, but one can obtain it. All the rest are liable to the disappointments and mortifications of defeat. Not so in religion. No matter how numerous the competitors, or how worthy any one of them may be, or how pre-eminent above his brethren, yet all may obtain the prize; all may be crowned with a diadem of life, of equal brilliancy. No one is excluded because another is successful; no one fails of the reward because another obtains it. Who, then, would not make an effort to win the immortal crown?<p>Unto all them also that love his appearing - That is, unto all who desire his second coming. To believe in the second advent of the Lord Jesus to judge the world, and to desire his return, became a kind of a criterion by which Christians were known. No others but true Christians were supposed to believe in that, and no others truly desired it; compare <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>. It is so now. It is one of the characteristics of a true Christian that he sincerely desires the return of his Saviour, and would weLcome his appearing in the clouds of heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. a crown&#8212;rather as Greek, "the crown."

A man is justified gratuitously by the merits of Christ through faith; and when he is so justified God accepts his works and honors them with a reward which is not their due, but is given of grace.

The partakers of the first resurrection may receive a crown also at the last day, and obtain in that general assembly of all men, a new award of praise. The favorable sentence passed on the "brethren" of the Judge, who sit with Him on His throne, is in Mt 25:40, taken for granted as already awarded, when that affecting those who benefited them is being passed [Bengel].

The happiness of the future state of the saints is signified by a crown, on account of the glory and excellency of it; and in perfect agreement with the character of the saints, as kings; and who are raised to sit among princes, and to inherit the throne of glory, and have a kingdom prepared for them; and this is called a crown "of righteousness", because it comes through the righteousness of Christ; it is that which gives a right unto it, and without which it cannot be enjoyed; and because it is obtained and possessed in a righteous way, and not by force and usurpation, as crowns sometimes are: it is God the Father's free gift unto his children, what they are born heirs unto, and have a meetness for, through regenerating and sanctifying grace, and have a legal title to it through the righteousness of Christ. Moreover, this may be expressive of the perfect holiness and righteousness of the heavenly state, and of the saints in it, wherein will dwell none but righteous persons, and who will be entirely without sin. And this happiness, signified by a crown, is "laid up"; in the covenant of grace for the saints, which is ordered in all things and sure; and in Christ, in whose hands their persons are, and their grace is, and with him also is their life of glory hid and secured: and this also is laid up in heaven, and reserved there, and that <p>for me, and thee; for particular persons, for all the vessels of mercy, for all that are chosen in Christ Jesus, and redeemed by his blood, and sanctified by his Spirit; <p>which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day. By the Lord is meant the Lord Jesus Christ; as is evident from his character, as a Judge, for the Father judgeth no man; and from mention being made hereafter of his appearing: Christ is ordained Judge of quick and dead, for which he is abundantly qualified, and a "righteous" one he will be; he is righteous as God, and as man, and as Mediator, in the discharge of all his offices, and so he will be as a Judge, in the administration of that office; righteousness will be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins; and from Christ, under this character, the apostle expected to receive all his future glory and happiness; and that both in a way of gift, as a free grace gift from him, and through him, and in a way of righteousness; and this seems to be a Jewish way of speaking. One of the Septuagint interpreters, whom Ptolomy king of Egypt sent for from Judea, to translate the law of Moses into Greek, in answer to a question put to him by the king, uses this phrase of , "a crown of righteousness"; and which he represents as the gift of God (z): <p>at that day; either at the day of death, the time of his dissolution, which was at hand; or at the day of the resurrection, and of the last judgment, when Christ will appear under the above character: and the apostle further observes, to the comfort and encouragement of Timothy, and others, that this happiness was not intended and prepared for himself only, but for others: <p>and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing; that is, his appearing at his second coming; which is to be loved, and so looked for by the saints, not only because it will be glorious in itself, in its attendants and consequences, but will be of great advantage to the saints; Christ will appear unto salvation to them, and so to their joy; they will appear with him in glory, and be like him, and enjoy the everlasting vision of him. The devils believe this appearance of Christ, but tremble at it; wicked men will behold him, and fear; saints know, believe, and love both Christ and his appearing; and such will wear that crown: the Ethiopic version renders it, "who love him at his coming"; all that love him now, will love him then. <p>(z) Aristeae Hist. 72.

This last interpretation is found in Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνην ἐνταῦθα τὴν καθόλου φησὶν ἀρετήν</span>; also in de Wette, Wiesinger, Plitt. It is indeed possible, but improbable, because in that case we would not be told of what the crown of victory consists.

The righteousness, the glory, and the life of the saints are conceived as displayed in crowns, as the kingly dignity is in the crown of royalty. <span class="cmt_word">The righteous Judge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a> the Lord Jesus is said to be ordained of God <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. "the Judge of quick and dead;" and in <a href="/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a> we read, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "God the Judge of all." But nowhere else, either in the Old Testament or the New Testament, is this term applied directly either to God or to Christ. Surely its use here is influenced by the preceding metaphor of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and "the righteous Judge" is the impartial <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, or "judge," who assigned the prizes at the games to those who had fairly won them. And this is the proper meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "the umpire," applied, especially at Athens, to the "judges" at the poetic contests (Liddell and Scott). Thucydides contrasts the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>; Aristophanes the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, the "spectators;" and the word "critic" is derived from this meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The whole picture is that of the apostle running his noble race of righteousness to the very end, and of the Lord himself assigning to him the well earned crown of victory in the presence of heaven and earth assembled for the solemnity of that great day. <span class="cmt_word">That have loved his appearing.</span> It will be a characteristic of those who will be crowned at that day that all the time they were lighting the good fight they were looking forward with hope and desire for their Lord's appearing and kingdom. "Thy kingdom come" was their desire and their petition. They will be able to say at that day, "So, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (<a href="/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>). <span class="accented">His appearing</span>; as in ver. 2. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Henceforth (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit. as to what remains. &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; or &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; either finally, as <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; or henceforth as here, <a href="/mark/14-41.htm">Mark 14:41</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a> : or for the rest, besides, as <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a> (note); <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>.<p>There is laid up (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Or laid away.
