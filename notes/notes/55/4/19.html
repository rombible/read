Originally of Pontus, they had taken up their abode at Rome, where Aquila exercised his trade of a tent-maker.<p>Driven out of Rome by the decree of Claudius, which banished the Jews from the capital, they came to Corinth, where St. Paul became acquainted with them. But they were evidently Christians when St. Paul first met them, about A.D. 51-2. We hear of them in company with St. Paul at Corinth, about A.D. 52-3 (<a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>); at Ephesus, about A.D. 55 (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19</a>); and in the year A.D. 58 St. Paul sends greetings to them at Rome (<a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>).<p>They were, evidently, among the many active and zealous teachers of the first days of the faith. That they possessed great ability as well as zeal is evident from the fact that it was from them that the eloquent and trained Alexandrian master, Apollos, learnt to be a Christian (<a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>). In this place, and in several other passages, Prisca (or Priscilla) is named <span class= "ital">before </span>her husband, Aquila. This would seem to hint that in this case the woman was the principal worker of the two in the cause of Christ. She, in fact, was one of that band of devoted holy women which the preaching of Christ and His disciples had called into existence: a representative of the great class of noble female workers which had no existence before Christ told the world what was the true position of women—until the same divine Master taught them that they, too, as well as men, had a work to work for Him here.<p><span class= "bld">And the household of Onesiphorus.</span>—St. Paul may have been aware that Onesiphorus was absent then from Ephesus; but this peculiar greeting, taken together with the words of <a href="/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2Timothy 1:16</a>, leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that this friend of St. Paul’s was dead when the Epistle was written. (See Notes on <a href="/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2Timothy 1:16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_timothy/4-19.htm" title="Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus....">2 Timothy 4:19-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Salute Prisca </span>— This word is a contraction of the name Priscilla; or, as Estius supposes, Priscilla may be the diminutive of Prisca. <span class="ital">Erastus abode at Corinth </span>— When I came from thence, being chamberlain of the city, <a href="/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you.

Timothy’s frequent infirmities afford a further argument to the same purpose. <span class="ital">Do thy diligence to come before winter </span>— Sailing being then dangerous. Some, comparing <a href="/hebrews/13-23.htm" title="Know you that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.">Hebrews 13:23</a> with this text, have concluded that Timothy did come, and was seized at Rome, and confined longer than Paul himself. But it seems much more probable that the epistle to the Hebrews was written during Paul’s first imprisonment, and consequently several years before this. <span class="ital">Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens </span>— Though these persons, like the other Roman brethren, did not appear with the apostle at his first answer, they did not flee from the city, nor desert him altogether; but visited him in his prison, and desired him to send their salutation to Timothy. Linus is said, by some of the ancients, to have been the first bishop of Rome, after the apostles Paul and Peter. But Theodoret speaks of this only as a tradition. Claudia is said to have been a British lady, whom Paul was the instrument of converting, and that she first carried the gospel into Britain. But of this there is no evidence. According to tradition, the Apostle Peter was now in Rome, and suffered martyrdom at the same time with St. Paul. But seeing Paul says, <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, <span class="ital">Only Luke is with me, </span>and <a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.">2 Timothy 4:16</a>, <span class="ital">At my first answer no one appeared with me; </span>also, seeing Peter’s salutation was not sent to Timothy, his being in Rome at the time this letter was written may justly be doubted. If he suffered martyrdom along with Paul, as the ancients affirm, he must have come to Rome after Paul wrote his second letter to Timothy. <span class="ital">Grace be with you </span>— This being a benediction distinct from the one bestowed on Timothy in the preceding clause, it must have been designed for such of the brethren where Timothy was, as maintained the truth of the gospel in purity. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:19-22 We need no more to make us happy, than to have the Lord Jesus Christ with our spirits; for in him all spiritual blessings are summed up.

Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>); afterwards were again at Rome ‘cessante edicti saevitia,’ perhaps on business; their house became a place of assembly for the Christians, and they endangered their lives for St Paul (<a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>). Now they seem settled at Ephesus. Dr Howson quotes Priscilla as the example of what the married woman may do for the general service of the Church, in conjunction with home duties, as Phœbe is the type of the unmarried servant of the Church or deaconess; and cites Archdeacon Evans as to her usefulness to Timothy at Ephesus. ‘In his dealings with the female part of his flock which in that time and country required peculiar delicacy and discretion, the counsel of the experienced Priscilla would be invaluable. Where for instance could he obtain more prudent and faithful advice than hers in the selection of widows to be placed upon the eleemosynary list of the church and of deaconesses for the ministry?’ Dict.
