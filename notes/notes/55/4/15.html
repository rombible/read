That he had been at Rome, and had given evidence against St. Paul, and had argued against the defence of the Apostle, is probable. “Our words” some understand as especially referring to St. Paul’s defence before the imperial tribunal. If we identify him with the Alexander of <a href="/context/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33-34</a>, then he was a Jew, one of those bitter, life-long antagonists of the Gentile Apostle who crossed his path at every step, and not improbably brought about, in the end, his death. It is an interesting suggestion which refers the connection between St. Paul and Alexander back to those days when Saul and Alexander were both reckoned as belonging to the strictest Pharisee party, determined foes to the “Nazarenes.” Saul—if we adopt this supposition—became the Apostle St. Paul of the Gentiles; Alexander remained a fanatic Jew—hence the enmity.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:14-18 There is as much danger from false brethren, as from open enemies. It is dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a man as Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, but when there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then all forsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, he will strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence will more than supply every one's absence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of whom be thou ware also - It would seem from this that Alexander was still a public teacher, and that his discourses were plausible and artful. The best and the wisest of men need to be on their guard against the efforts of the advocates of error.<p>For he hath greatly withstood our words - Margin, "preachings." The Greek is, "words;" but the reference is doubtless to the public teachings of Paul.

For he was now at Ephesus; and since he was such a malicious, ill natured, and troublesome person, as well as a blasphemer, an heretic, and had been delivered up to Satan, it was very advisable to shun his company, and have no conversation with him, and be upon the guard against him, that he might have no opportunity of doing hurt to him, or to the church at Ephesus: <p>for he hath greatly withstood our words: or doctrines; the truths of the Gospel preached by Paul and Timothy, which he opposed himself to, and resisted with all his might, and endeavoured to confute and overthrow; and wherein he was deficient in argument, he made up with railing and blasphemy; and this was the true reason of the apostle's imprecations on him, and why he would have Timothy beware of him, and avoid him, and not the personal injury he had done him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/4-15.htm" title="Of whom be you ware also; for he has greatly withstood our words.">2 Timothy 4:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">φυλάσσου</span>: For this sense of <span class="greekheb">φυλάσσω</span> with a direct object, see reff.

There might be thus a special point in the warning given to Timothy, lest Alexander should be on his track as he set out for Rome.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Withstood</span> for <span class="accented">hath withstood</span>, A.V.

In this case we may be sure that Paul, in pleading for his life, did not omit to preach the gospel to his Gentile audience. Alexander tried to refute his words, not without effect. The apostle says "<span class="accented">our</span> words" (not "<span class="accented">my</span> words"), perhaps to associate with himself those other Christians who were with him. It certainly cannot mean "yours and mine," as Timothy was not with him when the "words" were spoken. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Greatly withstood (&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;)<p>Comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>, and <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>.
