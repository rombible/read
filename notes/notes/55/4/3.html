The great drag-net of the Church, in its wide sweep, would keep drawing into its meshes something of every kind. Errors now just apparent, he must remember, would attain more formidable dimensions. The thirst for novelties in doctrine, the desire for a teaching which, while offering peace to a troubled conscience, would yet allow the old self-indulgent life to go on as before, would increase. In full view of this development of error, in sure expectation of a future full of anxious care, Timothy and his brother teachers must indeed be wakeful, watchful, and earnest in their preaching and ministrations. And the thought that more and ever more of the so-called Christians would dislike the preaching of the “sound doctrine,” as taught by the Apostle, the very knowledge of this growing unpopularity, must serve <span class= "ital">as</span> an incentive to greater labour, more interest, and more loving activity on the part of Timothy and his companions.<p><span class= "bld">But after their</span> <span class= "bld">own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers.</span>—“Their own lusts:” this expression gives us some insight into the reason which led to this future apostasy of so many, concerning which St. Paul warned Timothy. “Their own lusts,” which, at all risks, they would gratify, would serve to alienate them from that severe and strictly moral school of Apostolic teaching, in which the sternest morality was bound up with purity of doctrine, to which school St. Paul’s pupils—men like Timothy and the presbyters of Ephesus—belonged. These worldly ones to whom St. Paul referred, reluctant to part with the hope Christianity taught, and unwilling to live the life which St. Paul and Timothy insisted upon as necessary to be lived by all those who would share in that glorious hope, sought out for themselves more indulgent teachers, who would flatter and gratify their hearers with novelties in doctrine, and would, at the same time, lay comparatively little stress on the pure and saintly life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 People will turn away from the truth, they will grow weary of the plain gospel of Christ, they will be greedy of fables, and take pleasure in them.

At that time they would seek a kind of instruction more conformable to their wishes and feelings.<p>But after their own lusts - They will seek such kind of preaching as will accord with their carnal desires; or such as will palliate their evil propensities, and deal gently with their vices; compare <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>. "Speak unto us smooth things; prophesy deceits."<p>Shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears - The word rendered "heap" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  episo&#772;reuo&#772; - does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means "to heap up upon, to accumulate;" and here "to multiply." The word rendered "itching" - &#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;  kne&#772;tho&#772; - also occurs only in this place in the New Testament. It means "to rub, to scratch;" and then "to tickle," and here to feel an "itching" for something pleasing or gratifying. The image is derived from the desire which we have when there is an itching sensation, to have it rubbed or scratched. Such an uneasiness would these persons have to have some kind of instruction that would allay their restless and uneasy desires, or would gratify them. In explanation of this passage we may observe,<p>(1) that there will be always religious teachers of some kind, and that in proportion as error and sin abound, they will be multiplied. The apostle here says, that by turning away from Timothy, and from sound instruction, they would not abandon all religious teachers, but would rather increase and multiply them. People often declaim much against a regular ministry, and call it "priest-craft;" and yet, if they were to get rid of such a ministry, they would by no means escape from all kinds of religious teachers. The deeper the darkness, and the more gross the errors, and the more prevalent the wickedness of men, the more will a certain kind of religious teachers abound, and the more it will cost to support them. Italy and Spain swarm with priests, and in every pagan nation they constitute a very numerous class of the population. The cheapest ministry on the earth is a well-educated Protestant clergy, and if society wishes to free itself from swarms of preachers, and prophets, and exhorters, it should secure the regular services of an educated and pious ministry.<p>(2) in such classes of persons as the apostle here refers to, there is a restless, uneasy desire to have some kind of preachers. They have "itching ears." They will be ready to run after all kinds of public instructors. They will be little pleased with any, and this will be one reason why they will have so many. They are fickle, and unsettled, and never satisfied. A desire to hear the truth, and to learn the way of salvation, is a good desire. But this can be better gratified by far under the patient and intelligent labor of a single religious teacher, than by running after many teachers, or than by frequent changes. How much would a child learn if he was constantly running from one school to another?<p>(3) such persons would have teachers according to "their own lusts;" that is, their own tastes, or wishes. They would have those who would coincide with their whims; who would foster every vagary which might enter their imagination; who would countenance every wild project for doing good; who would be the advocates of the errors which they held; and who would be afraid to rebuke their faults. These are the principles on which many persons choose their religious teachers. The true principle should be, to select those who will faithfully declare the truth, and who will not shrink from exposing and denouncing sin, wherever it may be found. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. they&#8212;professing Christians.<p>sound doctrine&#8212;Greek, "the sound (see on [2506]1Ti 1:10) doctrine (didascalias)" or "teaching," namely, of the Gospel.

This is a reason of the solemn charge above given: the time referred to was future, when the apostle wrote, but quickly came on; and the characters of it have appeared more or less in all ages since; and in none more than in ours: <p>when they will not endure sound doctrine; the Gospel which contains the wholesome words of Christ, and is sound itself, having no corruption in it, and salutary in its effects to the souls of men; and yet such is the depravity of some men, both in principles and practice, that they cannot receive it, nor bear to hear it, turn their backs on it, express their indignation at it, and treat it not only with neglect, but with ridicule and contempt: <p>but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers; not being content with the ministry of one man only, or of a few, though of their own sort; but must follow many, and have heaps of them; which seems to express not only the number of false teachers which they accumulate to themselves, but the confused and indiscreet choice they make of them; and that after their own lusts; choosing to hear such as either indulge them in their sinful lusts and pleasures; or are agreeable to their private corrupt sentiments, in opposition to the generally received doctrine of faith. It is a blessing to have pastors and teachers after God's heart, and who preach according to the word of God; these feed men with knowledge and understanding, <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a> but it is a curse upon a people, when they are left to choose teachers after their hearts' lusts: <p>having itching ears; always desirous of new things, as the Athenians of old; or loving to have their ears scratched and tickled with smooth things; that are pleasing and agreeable to natural men, and carnal minds; as the purity of human nature, the power of man's free will, the excellency of his righteousness, and the merit of his works, and the like; see <a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>.

We cannot but see that the word here is meant to indicate the contemptible part of their conduct. The <span class="greekheb">ἐπι</span> does not compel us to follow Hofmann in his exposition: “in addition to those who represent sound doctrine;” what follows rather shows that they turn away from all such.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reason is given in the words: <span class="greekheb">κνηθόμενοι τὴν ἀκοήν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κνήθω</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>.), tickle, cause to itch; <span class="greekheb">κνηθόμενοι τὴν ἀκοήν</span>, “be tickled in the ear,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> feel a tickling in the ear (<span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀκοήν</span> being the accusative of more precise definition). This tickling is usually taken to mean a pleasant sensation;[57] so Hesychius: <span class="greekheb">ζητοῦντες τὶ ἀκοῦσαι καθʼ ἡδονήν</span>, and almost all expositors. But this view, before adopted in this commentary, is opposed by the fact that <span class="greekheb">ζητοῦντες</span> is purely imported. The present participle cannot mean: “that they <span class="ital">wish</span> to feel a tickling in the ear, but only that they do feel it.” Hofmann is therefore right in explaining this tickling of the ear to mean the desire of hearing something different from what they had heard before; “because they feel a tickling in the ear, they procure for themselves teachers after their own lusts.”—<a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm" title="And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.">2 Timothy 4:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπὸ μὲν τῆς ἀλ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀληθείας</span> = <span class="greekheb">τῆς ὑγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διδασκαλίας</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς μύθους</span>] see <a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1 Timothy 1:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκτραπήσονται</span>] see <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm" title="From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain jangling;">1 Timothy 1:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] Plutarch (<span class="ital">De Superst.</span> p. 167): <span class="greekheb">μονσικὴν ἀνθρώποις οὐ τρυφῆς ἕνεκα καὶ κνήσεως ὠτῶν δοθῆναι</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm" title="For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;">2 Timothy 4:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑγιαινούσης διδασκαλία</span>: See note on <a href="/1_timothy/1-10.htm" title="For fornicators, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for enslavers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;">1 Timothy 1:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἰδίας</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἴδιος</span> here, as constantly, has merely the force of a possessive pronoun.
