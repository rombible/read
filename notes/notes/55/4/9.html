Who would ever have dreamed of putting into the letter such a request as this, <span class= "ital">after</span> those solemn expressions of the last few verses, in which the Apostle spoke of himself as even <span class= "ital">then</span> tasting the bitterness of death? He had been writing as though the martyr’s death was so imminent that the preparations were already being made for it. This request to Timothy to come to him, <span class= "ital">after</span> he had written such thoughts down, is at first sight strange, and one certainly which no forger would have appended to the writing. But though the forger would never have thought of such a summons, <span class= "ital">St. Paul</span> might. He still lived, and the thought of life and the hope of life even in that brave Christ-loving heart still burned; after all, the martyrdom which seemed so close at hand <span class= "ital">might</span> be delayed. Days, months, might drag on their slow, weary length, and still find the old man languishing and solitary in his chains in that dreary prison. He longed to see some of his faithful companions once more, and for the last time to bid them with his own mouth to be faithful and brave. So, as it were, hoping against hope, he dictates on the last pages of the letter, “Do thy diligence,” or better, “<span class= "ital">earnestly endeavour</span> to come shortly to me.” His loving wish to see Timothy again appears from the words of <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a> : “greatly desiring to see thee;” and again from <a href="/2_timothy/4-21.htm" title="Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.">2Timothy 4:21</a>. “Do thy diligence to come before winter.” And some have seen in the expression, “being mindful of thy tears,” in <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a> (to which we have given, however, a different interpretation), a reciprocal anxiety on the part of Timothy to see and speak again with his old master. But St. Paul, though he begged him to hasten his journey as much as possible, and still, though all seemed so dark around him, <span class= "ital">hoped</span> to see him again, framed the charge of the last letter in such a way that Timothy, if when he reached Rome, should find that all was over, might know what were his master’s last wishes and directions. On the natural human longing for sympathy in the supreme hour, compare our blessed Lord’s words to Peter, James, and John (<a href="/matthew/26-38.htm" title="Then said he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry you here, and watch with me.">Matthew 26:38</a>): “My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, <span class= "ital">and</span> <span class= "ital">watch with Me.</span>”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_timothy/4-9.htm" title="Do your diligence to come shortly to me:...">2 Timothy 4:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Do thy diligence </span>— Endeavour by all means; <span class="ital">to come shortly unto me </span>— The apostle, now about to leave the world, wished to enjoy Timothy’s company and conversation for a little while, both that that evangelist might comfort him, and might be comforted and strengthened by him, so that he might suffer death courageously when called to do so. Accordingly, it is said by some, that he actually suffered martyrdom at Ephesus. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — As if he had said, I have the more need of thy company and assistance, because I have been deserted by some who ought to have acted in a very different manner: <span class="ital">Demas </span>— Once my fellow- labourer, (<a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>,) <span class="ital">hath forsaken me </span>— By calling the departure of Demas to Thessalonica a forsaking him, the apostle intimates that he departed without his permission. <span class="ital">Having loved this present world </span>— And gone where his secular views invited him. <span class="ital">Crescens </span>— Probably a preacher also, is gone with my consent <span class="ital">to Galatia.

Paul was guided by Divine inspiration, yet he would have his books. As long as we live, we must still learn. The apostles did not neglect human means, in seeking the necessaries of life, or their own instruction. Let us thank the Divine goodness in having given us so many writings of wise and pious men in all ages; and let us seek that by reading them our profiting may appear to all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me - As soon as possible. Timothy had been Paul's traveling companion, and was his intimate friend. The apostle was now nearly forsaken, and was about to pass through severe trials. It is not certainly known for what purpose he wished him to come to him, but perhaps he desired to give him some parting counsels; perhaps he wished him to be near him when he died. It is evident from this that he did not regard him as the prelatical "bishop of the church of the Ephesians," or consider that he was so confined to that place in his labors, that he was not also to go to other places if he was called in the providence of God. It is probable that Timothy would obey such a summons, and there is no reason to believe that he ever returned to Ephseus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.
