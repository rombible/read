First, he speaks generally of the combatant, the charioteer, and the runner. “I have fought the good fight,” leaving it undetermined what description of strife or contest was referred to. The tense of the Greek verb—the perfect—“I <span class= "ital">have</span> fought,” is remarkable. The struggle had been bravely sustained in the past, and was now being equally bravely sustained to the end. His claim to the crown (<a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2Timothy 4:8</a>) was established.<p><span class= "bld">I have finished my course.</span>—Or “race,” for here the image of the stadium, the Olympic race-course, was occupying the Apostle’s thoughts. Again the perfect is used: “I <span class= "ital">have</span> finished my course.” How, asks, Chrysostom, “had he finished his course?” and answers rather rhetorically by replying that he had made the circuit of the world. The question is better answered in St. Paul’s own words (<a href="/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>), where he explains “his course,” which he would finish with joy, as the ministry which he had received of the Lord Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">I have kept the faith.</span>—Here, again, the metaphor is changed, and St. Paul looks back on his lived life as on one long, painful struggle to guard the treasure of the Catholic faith inviolate and untarnished (see <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>). And now the struggle was over, and he handed on the sacred deposit, safe. It is well to compare this passage with the words of the same Apostle in the Epistle to the Philippians (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.">2Timothy 3:12</a>, and following verses). The same metaphors were in the Apostle’s mind on both occasions; but in the first instance (in the Philippian Epistle) they were used by the anxious, care worn servant of the Lord, hoping and, at the same time, fearing what the future had in store for him and his Church; in the second (in the Epistle to Timothy) they were the expression of the triumphant conviction of the dying follower of Christ, who had so followed his loved Master in life, that he now shrank not from following the same Master in death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/2_timothy/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A FULFILLED ASPIRATION<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a></span>. - <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2 Timothy 4:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I do not suppose that Paul in prison, and within sight of martyrdom, remembered his words at Ephesus. But the fact that what was aspiration whilst he was in the very thick of his difficulties came to be calm retrospect at the close is to me very beautiful and significant. ‘So that I may finish my course,’ said he wistfully; whilst before him there lay dangers clearly discerned and others that had all the more power over the imagination because they were but dimly discerned-’Not knowing the things that shall befall me there,’ said he, but knowing this, that ‘bonds and afflictions abide me.’ When a man knows exactly what he has to be afraid of he can face it. When he knows a little corner of it, and also knows that there is a great stretch behind that is unknown, that is a state of things that tries his mettle. Many a man will march up to a battery without a tremor who would not face a hole where a snake lay. And so Paul’s ignorance, as well as Paul’s knowledge, made it very hard for him to say ‘None of these things move me’ if only ‘I might finish my course.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now there are in these two passages, thus put together, three points that I touch for a moment. These are, What Paul thought that life chiefly was; what Paul aimed at; and what Paul won thereby.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. What he thought that life chiefly was.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘That I may finish my course.’ Now ‘course,’ in our modern English, is far too feeble a word to express the Apostle’s idea here. It has come to mean with us a quiet sequence or a succession of actions which, taken together, complete a career; but in its original force the English word ‘course,’ and still more the Greek, of which it is a translation, contain a great deal more than that. If we were to read ‘race,’ we should get nearer to at least one side of the Apostle’s thought. This was the image under which life presented itself to him, as it does to every man that does anything in the world worth doing, whether he be Christian or not-as being not a place for enjoyment, for selfish pursuits, making money, building family, satisfying love, seeking pleasure, or the like; but mainly as being an appointed field for a succession of efforts, all in one direction, and leading progressively to an end. In that image of life as a race, threadbare as it is, there are several grave considerations involved, which it will contribute to the nobleness of our own lives to keep steadily in view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To begin with, the metaphor regards life as a track or path marked out and to be kept to by us. Paul thought of his life as a racecourse, traced for him by God, and from which it would be perilous and rebellious to diverge. The consciousness of definite duties loomed larger than anything else before him. His first waking thought was, ‘What is God’s will for me to-day? What stage of the course have I to pass over to-day?’ Each moment brought to him an appointed task which at all hazards he must do. And this elevating, humbling, and bracing ever-present sense of responsibility, not merely to circumstances, but to God, is an indispensable part of any life worth the living, and of any on which a man will ever dare to look back.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘My course.’ O brethren! if we carried with us, always present, that solemn, severe sense of all-pervading duty and of obligation laid upon us to pursue faithfully the path that is appointed us, there would be less waste, less selfishness, less to regret, and less that weakens and defiles, in the lives of us all. And blessed be His name! however trivial be our tasks, however narrow our spheres, however secular and commonplace our businesses or trades, we may write upon them, as on all sorts of lives, except weak and selfish ones, this inscription, ‘Holiness to the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The broad arrow stamped on Crown property gives a certain dignity to whatever bears it, and whatever small duty has the name of God written across it is thereby ennobled. If our days are to be full-fraught with the serenity and purity which it is possible for them to attain, and if we ourselves are to put forth all our powers and make the most of ourselves, we must cultivate the continual sense that life is a course-a series of definite duties marked out for us by God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Again, the image suggests the strenuous efforts needed for discharge of our appointed tasks. The Apostle, like all men of imaginative and sensitive nature, was accustomed to speak in metaphors, which expressed his fervid convictions more adequately than more abstract expressions would have done. That vigorous figure of a ‘course’ speaks more strongly of the stress of continual effort than many words. It speaks of the straining muscles, and the intense concentration, and the forward-flung body of the runner in the arena. Paul says in effect, ‘I, for my part, live at high pressure. I get the most that I can out of myself. I do the very best that is in me.’ And that is a pattern for us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is nothing to be done unless we are contented to live on the stretch. Easygoing lives are always contemptible lives. A man who never does anything except what he can do easily never comes to do anything greater than what he began with, and never does anything worth doing at all. Effort is the law of life in all departments, as we all of us know and practise in regard to our daily business. But what a strange thing it is that we seem to think that our Christian characters can be formed and perfected upon other conditions, and in other fashions, than those by which men make their daily bread or their worldly fortunes!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The direction which effort takes is different in these two regions. The necessity for concentration and vigorous putting into operation of every faculty is far more imperative in the Christian course than in any other form of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I believe most earnestly that we grow Christlike, not by effort only, but by faith. But I believe that there is no faith without effort, and that the growth which comes from faith will not be appropriated and made ours without it. And so I preach, without in the least degree feeling that it impinges upon the great central truth that we are cleansed and perfected by the power of God working upon us, the sister truth that we must ‘work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Brethren, unless we are prepared for the dust and heat of the race, we had better not start upon the course. Christian men have an appointed task, and to do it will take all the effort that they can put forth, and will assuredly demand continuous concentration and the summoning of every faculty to its utmost energy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Still further, there is another idea that lies in the emblem, and that is that the appointed task which thus demands the whole man in vigorous exercise ought in fact to be, and in its nature is, progressive. Is the Christianity of the average church member and professing Christian a continuous advance? Is to-day better than yesterday? Are former attainments continually being left behind? Does it not seem the bitterest irony to talk about the usual life of a Christian as a course? Did you ever see a squad of raw recruits being drilled in the barrack-yard? The first thing the sergeants do is to teach them the ‘goose-step,’ which consists in lifting up one foot and then the other, <span class="ital">ad infinitum</span>, and yet always keeping on the same bit of ground. That is the kind of ‘course’ which hosts of so-called Christians content themselves with running-a vast deal of apparent exercise and no advance. They are just at the same spot at which they stood five, ten, or twenty years ago; not a bit wiser, more like Christ, less like the devil and the world; having gained no more mastery over their characteristic evils; falling into precisely the same faults of temper and conduct as they used to do in the far-away past. By what right can <span class="ital">they</span> talk of running the Christian race? Progress is essential to real Christian life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Turn now to another thought here, and consider what Paul aimed at.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is a very easy thing for a man to say, ‘I take the discharge of my duty, given to me by Jesus Christ, as my great purpose in life,’ when there is nothing in the way to prevent him from carrying out that purpose. But it is a very different thing when, as was the case with Paul, there lie before him the certainties of affliction and bonds, and the possibilities which very soon consolidated themselves into certainties, of a bloody death and that swiftly. To say <span class="ital">then</span>, without a quickened pulse or a tremor in the eyelid, or a quiver in the voice, or a falter in the resolution, to say then, ‘none of these things move me, if only I may do what I was set to do’-that is to be in Christ indeed; and that is the only thing worth living for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Look how beautifully we see in operation in these heartfelt and few words of the Apostle the power that there is in an absolute devotion to God-enjoined duty, to give a man ‘a solemn scorn of ills,’ and to lift him high above everything that would bar or hinder his path. Is it not bracing to see any one actuated by such motives as these? And why should they not be motives for us all? The one thing worth our making our aim in life is to accomplish our course.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now notice that the word in the original here, ‘finish,’ does not merely mean ‘end,’ which would be a very poor thing. Time will do that for us all. It will end our course. But an ended course may yet be an unfinished course. And the meaning that the Apostle attaches to the word in both of our texts is not merely to scramble through anyhow, so as to get to the last of it; but to complete, accomplish the course, or, to put away the metaphor, to do all that it was meant by God that he should do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now some very early transcriber of the Acts of the Apostles mistook the Apostle’s meaning, and thought that he only said that he desired to end his career; and so, with the best intentions in the world, he inserted, probably on the margin, what he thought was a necessary addition-that unfortunate ‘with joy,’ which appears in our Authorised Version, but has no place in the true text. If we put it in we necessarily limit the meaning of the word ‘finish’ to that low, superficial sense which I have already dismissed. If we leave it out we get a far nobler thought. Paul was not thinking about the joy at the end. What he wanted was to do his work, all of it, right through to the very last. He knew there would be joy, but he does not speak about it. What he wanted, as all faithful men do, was to do the work, and let the joy take care of itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And so for all of us, the true anaesthetic or ‘painkiller’ is that all-dominant sense of obligation and duty which lays hold upon us, and grips us, and makes us, not exactly indifferent to, but very partially conscious of, the sorrows or the hindrances or the pains that may come in our way. You cannot stop an express train by stretching a rope across the line, nor stay the flow of a river with a barrier of straw. And if a man has once yielded himself fully to that great conception of God’s will driving him on through life, and prescribing his path for him, it is neither in sorrow nor in joy to arrest his course. They may roll all the golden apples out of the garden of the Hesperides in his path, and he will not stop to pick one of them up; or Satan may block it with his fiercest flames, and the man will go into them, saying, ‘When I pass through the fires He will be with me.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, what Paul won thereby.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘That I <span class="ital">may</span> finish my course . . . I <span class="ital">have</span> finished my course’; in the same lofty meaning, not merely <span class="ital">ended</span>, though that was true, but ‘completed, accomplished, perfected.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now some hyper-sensitive people have thought that it was very strange that the Apostle, who was always preaching the imperfection of all human obedience and service, should, at the end of his life, indulge in such a piece of what they fancy was self-complacent retrospect as to say ‘I have kept the faith; I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course.’ But it was by no means complacent self-righteousness. Of course he did not mean that he looked back upon a career free from faults and flecks and stains. No. There is only one pair of human lips that ever could say, in the full significance of the word, ‘It is finished! . . . I have completed the work which Thou gavest Me to do.’ Jesus Christ’s retrospect of a stainless career, without defect or discordance at any point from the divine ideal, is not repeated in any of His servants’ experiences. But, on the other hand, if a man in the middle of his difficulties and his conflict pulls himself habitually together and says to himself, ‘Nothing shall move me, so that I may complete this bit of my course,’ depend upon it, his effort, his believing effort, will not be in vain; and at the last he will be able to look back on a career which, though stained with many imperfections, and marred with many failures, yet on the whole has realised the divine purpose, though not with absolute completeness, at least sufficiently to enable the faithful servant to feel that all his struggle has not been in vain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Brethren, no one else can. And oh! how different the two ‘courses’ of the godly man and the worldling look, in their relative importance, when seen from this side, as we are advancing towards them, and from the other as we look back upon them! Pleasures, escape from pains, ease, comfort, popularity, quiet lives-all these things seem very attractive; and God’s will often seems very hard and very repulsive, when we are advancing towards some unwelcome duty. But when we get beyond it and look back, the two careers have changed their characters; and all the joys that could be bought at the price of the smallest neglected duty or the smallest perpetrated sin, dwindle and dwindle and dwindle, and the light is out of them, and they show for what they are-nothings, gilded nothings, painted emptinesses, lies varnished over. And on the other hand, to do right, to discharge the smallest duty, to recognise God’s will, and with faithful effort to seek to do it in dependence upon Him, that towers and towers and towers, and there seems to be, as there really is, nothing else worth living for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So let us live with the continual remembrance in our minds that all which we do has to be passed in review by us once more, from another standpoint, and with another illumination falling upon it. And be sure of this, that the one thing worth looking back upon, and possible to be looked back upon with peace and quietness, is the humble, faithful, continual discharge of our appointed tasks for the dear Lord’s sake. If you and I, whilst work and troubles last, do truly say, ‘None of these things move me, so that I <span class="ital">might</span> finish my course,’ we too, with all our weaknesses, may be able to say at the last, ‘Thanks be to God! I <span class="ital">have</span> finished my course.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:6-8 The blood of the martyrs, though not a sacrifice of atonement, yet was a sacrifice of acknowledgment to the grace of God and his truth. Death to a good man, is his release from the imprisonment of this world, and his departure to the enjoyments of another world. As a Christian, and a minister, Paul had kept the faith, kept the doctrines of the gospel. What comfort will it afford, to be able to speak in this manner toward the end of our days! The crown of believers is a crown of righteousness, purchased by the righteousness of Christ. Believers have it not at present, yet it is sure, for it is laid up for them. The believer, amidst poverty, pain, sickness, and the agonies of death, may rejoice; but if the duties of a man's place and station are neglected, his evidence of interest in Christ will be darkened, and uncertainty and distress may be expected to cloud and harass his last hours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have fought a good fight - The Christian life is often represented as a conflict, or warfare; see the notes on <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>.

In the prospect of his approaching end, Paul expresses the consciousness of having been faithful in the career appointed to him, and the hope of the heavenly reward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no ground whatever for de Wette’s assertion, that this expression is opposed to Christian humility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν καλὸν ἀγῶνα ἠγώνισμαι</span>] Luther inaccurately: “I have fought a good fight.” The definite article must not be overlooked; see <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>. The perfect <span class="greekheb">ἠγώνισμαι</span> shows that the apostle now stood at the end of the fight to which he was called as the apostle of the Lord,[62] and that he had fought through it faithfully.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Baur, quite arbitrarily, is of opinion that <a href="/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Php 1:30</a> was here made use of; as little was the passage at <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a> ff. used (de Wette).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν δρόμον τετέληκα</span>] The same thought is expressed by the more definite figure of a <span class="ital">race</span>. The point chiefly brought out is that the apostle, after continuing it without stopping, now stands at the goal. Compare with this passage <a href="/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>; the same figure is used also in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>, and is indicated in <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν πίστιν τετήρηκα</span>] “<span class="ital">I have kept the faith</span>,” viz. against all inducements to deny it. Heydenreich wrongly takes this expression also as a figurative one, and expounds <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> to mean fidelity in observing the laws of battle and rules of the race; comp. against this, <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν καλὸν ἀγῶνα τῆς πίστεως</span>] Bengel: res bis per metaphoram expressa nunc tertio loco exprimitur proprie.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[62] Hofmann wrongly maintains that the apostle is not speaking here of his labours in the calling of an apostle, but generally of his Christian calling. The context clearly points to the former.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2 Timothy 4:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὸν καλὸν ἀγῶνα ἠγώνισμαι</span>: See note on <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>. The following <span class="greekheb">τὸν δρόμου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., makes this reference to the games hardly doubtful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν δρόμον τετέλεκα</span>: <span class="ital">cursum consummavi</span> (Vulg.).

To say “My race is run,” is not to boast, but merely to state a fact. The figure is also found in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>, <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a>. The course is the race of life; we must not narrow it, as Chrys. does, to St. Paul’s missionary travels.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν πίστιν τετήρηκα</span>: As in <a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2 Timothy 2:21</a>, St. Paul passes from the metaphor to the reality. For the force of <span class="greekheb">τηρέω</span> here, see note on <a href="/1_timothy/6-14.htm" title="That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/14-12.htm" title="Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.">Revelation 14:12</a>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ τηροῦντες τὰς ἐντολὰς τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὴν πίστιν Ἰησοῦ</span>. The faith is a deposit, <span class="greekheb">παραθήκη</span>, a trust which the Apostle is now ready to render up to Him who entrusted it to him. There is no real inconsistency between the tone of this passage and that of some in earlier epistles, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a>, <span class="ital">sqq</span>. St. Paul is merely stating what the grace of God had done for him. A man does well to be distrustful as regards his use of the years of life that may remain to him; but when the life that he has lived has been admittedly lived “in the faith which is in the Son of God” (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), mock modesty becomes mischievous ingratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_timothy/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">a good fight</span>] <span class="bld">the good fight</span>, see <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>, where the metaphor is discussed; the second clause here, ‘I have finished the course,’ certainly suggests that the foot-race is to be the chief thought in the ‘games contest,’ ‘the fair race—’tis run; the course—’tis finished; the faith—’tis kept’ may represent the perfect tense used: ‘per effectus suos durat,’ Poppo. The aspirations of <a href="/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>, <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a>, have now been realised; the Christian athlete is all but ‘emeritus.’ ‘He stands almost alone under the shadow of an impending death; but it is the last effort of a defeated and desperate cause: the victory is already gained.… With the assured conviction that the object of his life was fully accomplished, he might well utter these words on which seventeen centuries have now set their indisputable seal.’ Stanley, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, pp. 169–170.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the faith</span>] In the same objective sense as so often throughout these Epistles, the sacred deposit of historic truth and teaching, cf. <a href="/context/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:...">1 Timothy 6:20-21</a>, &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_timothy/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2 Timothy 4:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν ἀγῶνα καλὸν</span>) <span class="ital">that good fight</span>.

The word "fight" does not adequately express by agora, which embraces all kinds of contests - chariot race, foot race, wrestling, etc. "I have played out the honourable game" would give the sense, though inelegantly. <span class="cmt_word">The course</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="/acts/13-25.htm">Acts 13:25</a>; <a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>.
