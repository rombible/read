It is the best prayer we can offer for our friends, that the Lord Jesus Christ may be with their spirits, to sanctify and save them, and at last to receive them to himself.

The subscription to this Epistle was not added by Paul himself, nor is there any evidence that it was by an inspired man, and it is of no authority. There is not the slightest evidence that Timothy was "ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians," or that he was a "bishop" there at all. There is no reason to believe that he was even a "pastor" there, in the technical sense; see the notes on <a href="/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>.

The Syriac version renders it, "grace be with thee"; but the Greek copies read in the plural, "with you"; which shows that the epistle was designed for the use of the whole church, as well as of Timothy. The subscription follows, which is not in many ancient copies, and is not to be depended on. <p>The second epistle unto Timotheus; so far is right; this is certainly the second epistle to Timothy: <p>ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians: this is omitted in the Syriac version; nor is it likely, much less certain, that he ever was bishop of Ephesus, or ordained as a bishop of any place, but was rather an evangelist, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, <p>was written from Rome: this is evident from his being a prisoner when he wrote it, <a href="/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>.
