Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality, for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger; but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, and abusing their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancy themselves the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformity to the world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure. Those who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of the troubles of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placed their happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts upon them, shall be deprived of those pleasures.

They bade that day as it were, be gone. The Hebrew idiom expresses, how they would put it off, if they could; as far as in them lay, they "assigned a distance to it, , although they could not remove the day itself. The "evil day" is that same "day of the Lord," which the scoffers or misbelievers professed to long for <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>. The thought that the Lord has a Day, in which to judge man, frets or frightens the irreligious, and they use different ways to get rid of it. The strong harden themselves against it, distort the belief in it, or disbelieve it. The weak and voluptuous shut their eyes to it, like the bird in the fable, as if what they dread would cease to be there, because they cease to see it.<p>And cause the seat - (literally, the session, sitting) of violence to come near They dismissed the thought of the Day of account, in order that they might sin with less fear. They put from them the judgment of God, that they might exercise violence over His creatures. People do not put away the thought of God, except to invite His Enemy into their souls. But therewith, they "brought near" another "seat of violence," not their own, but upon them. They brought near what they wished to put away, the day, in which, through the violence of the Assyrians, God would avenge their own.<p>Rib.: "Let them consider this, who put no bound to their sins.

Ye persuade yourselves that "the evil day" foretold by the prophets is "far off," though they declare it near (Eze 12:22, 27). Ye in your imagination put it far off, and therefore bring near violent oppression, suffering it to sit enthroned, as it were, among you (Ps 94:20). The notion of judgment being far off has always been an incentive to the sinner's recklessness of living (Ec 8:12, 13; Mt 24:48). Yet that very recklessness brings near the evil day which he puts far off.

The day of Israel's captivity, threatened by, the Lord, and prophesied of by the prophets; by this prophet, and by Hoshea and others: this they endeavoured to put out of their minds and thoughts, and supposed it to be at a great distance, yea, hoped it never would be; and like the Jews, with respect to their captivity, and the destruction of their city, said it was not near, but prolonged, yea, would never come to pass, <a href="/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; so some men put far from them the day of death; which though to a good man is better than the day of his birth, yet to a wicked man is an evil and terrible day; he do not care to hear or speak, or think of it, lest it should dampen his carnal joys and pleasures: as also the day of Christ's coming to judgment; which though a good man hastens to in his affections, desires, and prayers, wicked men set at the greatest distance, yea, scoff at it, as believing it never will be, and to show that they are in no pain or uneasiness about it; see <a href="/isaiah/56-12.htm">Isaiah 56:12</a>.

The prophet therefore proceeds to call upon the priests to offer to the Lord penitential supplication day and night in the temple, and to call the elders and all the people to observe a day of fasting, penitence, and prayer; and then offers supplication himself to the Lord to have compassion upon them (<a href="/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>). From the motive assigned for this appeal, we may also see that a terrible drought had been associated with the devastation by the locusts, from which both man and beast had endured the most bitter suffering, and that Joel regarded this terrible calamity as a sign of the coming of the day of the Lord. <a href="/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>. "Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests; howl, ye servants of the altar; come, pass the night in sackcloth, ye servants of my God: for the meat-offering and drink-offering are withdrawn from the house of your God. <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>. Sanctify a fast, call out an assembly, assemble the elders, all ye inhabitants of the land, at the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah." From what follows we must supply bassaqq&#305;&#772;m (with sackcloth) to chigru&#772; (gird yourselves). Gird yourselves with mourning apparel, i.e., put it on (see <a href="/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>). In this they are to pass the night, to offer supplication day and night, or incessantly, standing between the altar and the porch (<a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>). "Servants of my God," i.e., of the God whose prophet I am, and from whom I can promise you a hearing. The reason assigned for this appeal is the same as for the lamentation in <a href="/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>. But it is not the priests only who are to pray incessantly to the Lord; the elders and all the people are to do the same. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501;, to sanctify a fast, i.e., to appoint a holy fast, a divine service of prayer connected with fasting. To this end the priests are to call an &#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;ra&#770;h, i.e., a meeting of the congregation for religious worship. &#8219;Atsa&#770;ra&#770;h, or &#8219;a&#774;tsereth, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, is synonymous with &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a> (see the exposition of that passage). In what follows, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492; is attached &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; to &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; and the latter is not a vocative, but an accusative of the object. On the other hand, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is an accus. loci, and dependent upon &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;. &#1494;&#1506;&#1511;, to cry, used of loud and importunate prayer. It is only by this that destruction can still be averted. </body></html>
