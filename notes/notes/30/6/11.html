"Blow ye the trumpet upon Zion, and cause it to sound upon my holy mountain! All the inhabitants of the land shall tremble; for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is near." That this summons is addressed to the priests, is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>, compared with <a href="/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>. On tiq&#8219;u&#772; sho&#772;pha&#770;r and ha&#770;r&#305;&#772;&#8219;u&#772;, see at <a href="/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>. "Upon Zion," i.e., from the top of the temple mountain. Zion is called the holy mountain, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>, because the Lord was there enthroned in His sanctuary, on the summit of Moriah, which He claimed as His own. Ra&#770;gaz, to tremble, i.e., to start up from their careless state (Hitzig). On the expression, "for the day of Jehovah cometh," see <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>. By the position of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; at the head of the sentence, and that in the perfect &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; instead of the imperfect, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>, the coming of the day of Jehovah is represented as indisputably certain. The addition of k&#305;&#772; qa&#770;ro&#772;bh (for it is near) cannot be accounted for, however, from the fact that in the spiritual intuition of the prophet this day had already come, whereas in reality it was only drawing near (Hengstenberg); for such a separation as this between one element of prophesying and another is inconceivable. The explanation is simply, that the day of the Lord runs throughout the history of the kingdom of God, so that it occurs in each particular judgment: not, however, as fully manifested, but simply as being near or approaching, so far as its complete fulfilment is concerned. Joel now proclaims the coming of the day in its full completion, on the basis of the judgment already experienced, as the approach of a terrible army of locusts that darkens the land, at the head of which Jehovah is riding in all the majesty of the Judge of the world. The description is divided into three strophes thus: he first of all depicts the sight of this army of God, as seen afar off, and its terrible appearance in general (<a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a> and <a href="/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>); then the appearance and advance of this mighty army (<a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4-6</a>); and lastly, its irresistible power (<a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-7.htm">Joel 2:7-11</a>); and closes the first strophe with a figurative description of the devastation caused by this terrible army, whilst in the second and third he gives prominence to the terror which they cause among all nations, and over all the earth. </body></html>
