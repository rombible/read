They had helps for their souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthly enjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers are great blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to be so. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wanting to them in the means of grace. They did what they could to lead believers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds of young people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them to the love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudes of young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erred through strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complains of sin, especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden to him. And though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and so the sinner will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, adding obstinacy to sin, and this becomes the general character of a people, they will be given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boasted power and resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, for all our ingratitude and unfaithfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet - (and I) I((Emphatic) destroyed Such were "their" doings; such their worship of "their God." And what had "God" done? what was it, which they thus requited?<p>The Amorite - These, as one of the mightiest of the Canaanite tribes, stand in Moses for all. Moses, in rehearsing to them the goodness of God and their backsliding, reminds them, how he had said, "Ye have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord your God giveth you" <a href="/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>; and that they, using this same word, said, "Because the Lord hateth us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us" <a href="/deuteronomy/1-27.htm">Deuteronomy 1:27</a>. The aged Joshua, in rehearsing God's great deeds for Israel, places first by itself the destruction of the Amorite before them, with the use of this same idiom , "I brought you into the land of the Amorites which dwelt on the other side of Jordan - and I destroyed them before you." The Amorites were descended from the 4th son of Canaan <a href="/genesis/10-16.htm">Genesis 10:16</a>.<p>At the invasion of Chedorlaomer, a portion of them  dwelt at Hazezon-Tamar or Engedi, half way on the west side of the Dead Sea, and at Hebron near it (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>, <a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>; compare <a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>). Their corruption had not yet reached its height, and the return of Israel was delayed to the four hundredth year, "because the iniquity of the Amorite was not yet full" <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>. When Israel returned, the Amorites, (together with the Hittites and the Jebusites) held the hill country <a href="/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>, Jerusalem, Hebron, Gibeon <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-2.htm">2 Samuel 21:2</a>, and, on the skirts of the mountains westward  Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>, <a href="/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a>.

Those near Idumea were probably absorbed in Edom; and the remnant in Dan, after becoming tributary to Ephraim <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35-36</a>, lost their national existence perhaps among the Philistines, since we have thenceforth only the single notice in the days of Samuel after the defeat of the Philistines, "there was peace between Israel and the Amorites" <a href="/1_samuel/7-14.htm">1 Samuel 7:14</a>.<p>Whose height was like the height of the cedars - The giant sons of Anak were among the Amorites at "Hebron" <a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a> (called for a time Kiriath Arba <a href="/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-14</a> from their giant father) "Debir, Ahab, and the mountains of Judah and Israel <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>. The valley of Rephaim" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>, southwest of Jerusalem, connects this giant race with the Amorites, as does the fact that Og, king of the Amorites in Basan, was "of the remnant of the Rephaim" <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a>. Basan and Argob were, in Moses' time, still called "the land of Rephaim" <a href="/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>. The Rephaim, with the Perizzites, dwelt still in woody mountains near Ephraim; from where, on the complaint that the lot of the sons of Joseph was too narrow, Joshua bade his tribe to expel them <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17-15.htm">Joshua 17:15</a>, <a href="/joshua/17-18.htm">Joshua 17:18</a>. The Rephaim are mentioned between the Perizzites and the Amorites <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20-21</a>, in God's first promise of the land to Abraham's seed, and perhaps some intermixture of race gave the giant stature to the Amorites. It is clear from Amos that the report of the spies, "all the people that we saw in it were men of stature" <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a>, was no exaggeration, nor did Joshua and Caleb deny "this." The name of the Amorite is probably connected with "commanding," describing some quality of their forefather, which descended to his race.<p>Whose height was like the height of cedars - Giant height is sometimes a cause of weakness. Amos, in a degree like Hosea combines distinct images to make up the idea of stateliness and strength. The cedar is the ideal of eastern trees for height <a href="/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>, stretching forth its arms as for protection , "It groweth to an exceeding height, and with increasing time ever riseth higher." The oak has its Hebrew name from strength. The more majestic the tall strength of the Amorite, the more manifest that Israel "got not the land in possession by their own sword" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>, who had counted themselves, in sight of the Amorite, "as grasshoppers" <a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>. God, who gave him that strength, took it away, as we say, "root and branch," leaving him no show above, no hope of recovered life below (see <a href="/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>; <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a>). Having compared each Amorite to a majestic tree, he compares the excision of the whole nation to the cutting down of that one tree , so swift, so entire, so irrecoverable. Yet the destruction of the Amorite, a mercy to Israel in the purpose of God, was a warning to israel when it became as they. God's terrors are mercies to the repentant; God's mercies are terrors to the impenitent. "Ye shall keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not commit any of these abominations," was the tenure upon which they held the Lord's land, "that the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you" <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>, 38. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The expression is chosen with a reference to ro&#772;bh gibbo&#772;r&#305;&#772;m (the multitude of mighty men), in which Israel put its trust. The meaning, countrymen, or tribes, is restricted to the older language of the Pentateuch. The singular &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491; refers to &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10</a>, contrary to the ordinary language (cf. Ewald, 317, c). Nothing is known concerning the devastation of Beth-Arbeel by Shalman; and hence there has always been great uncertainty as to the meaning of the words. Shalman is no doubt a contracted form of Shalmanezer, the king of Assyria, who destroyed the kingdom of the ten tribes (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). Be&#772;th-'arbe&#772;'l is hardly Arbela of Assyria, which became celebrated through the victory of Alexander (Strab. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/16-3.htm">Isaiah 16:3</a>), since the Israelites could scarcely have become so well acquainted with such a remote city, as that the prophet could hold up the desolation that befel it as an example to them, but in all probability the Arbela in Galilaea Superior, which is mentioned in 1 Maccabees 9:2, and very frequently in Josephus, a place in the tribe of Naphtali, between Sephoris and Tiberias (according to Robinson, Pal. iii. pp. 281-2, and Bibl. Researches, p. 343: the modern Irbid). The objection offered by Hitzig, - viz. that sho&#772;d is a noun in <a href="/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>, and that the infinitive construct, with &#1500; prefixed, is written &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; in <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; and lastly, that if Shalman were the subject, we should expect the preposition &#1488;&#1514; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, - is not conclusive, and the attempt which he makes to explain Salman-Beth-Arbel from the Sanscrit is not worth mentioning. The clause "mother and children," etc., a proverbial expression denoting inhuman cruelty (see at <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>), does not merely refer to the conduct of Shalman in connection with Beth-arbel, possibly in the campaign mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3</a>, but is also intended to indicate the fate with which the whole of the kingdom of Israel was threatened. In <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a> this threat concludes with an announcement of the overthrow of the monarchy, accompanied by another allusion to the guilt of the people. The subject to &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is Beth-el (Chald.), not Shalman or Jehovah. Bethel, the seat of the idolatry, prepares this lot for the people on account of its great wickedness. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is a perf. proph.' and &#1512;&#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;, wickedness in its second potency, extreme wickedness (cf.

The gerund &#1504;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; adds to the force; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474; is not this or the other king, but as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7</a>, the king generally, i.e., the monarchy of Israel. </body></html>
