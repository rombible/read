Those that deal cruelly, shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God. Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile idolatry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For three transgressions of Judah etc. - Rup.: "Here too there is no difference of Jew and Gentile. The word of God, a just judge, spareth no man's person. whom sin joins in one, the sentence of the Judge disjoins not in punishment" <a href="/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>. "As many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law, and as many as have signed in the law, shall be judged by the law." Jerome: "Those other nations, Damascus and the rest, he upbraids not for having cast away the law of God, and despised His commandments, for they had not the written law, but that of nature only. So then of them he says, that "they corrupted all their compassions" - and the like. But Judah, who, at that time, had the worship of God and the temple and its rites, and had received the law and commandments and judgments and precepts and testimonies, is rebuked and convicted by the Lord, for that it had "cast aside His law and not kept His commandments;" wherefore it should be punished as it deserved.<p>And since they rejected and despised these, then, in course, "their lies deceived them," that is, their idols; "lies" on their part who made them and worshiped them for the true God, and "lies" and lying to them, as deceiving their hopes. "For an idol is nothing in the world" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>, as neither are all the vanities in the world whereof people make idols, but they deceive by a vain show, as though they were something. Jerome: "They would not have been deceived by their idols, unless they had first rejected the law of the Lord and not done His commandments." They had sinned with a high hand: "despising" and so rejecting the law of God; and so He despised and rejected them, leaving them to be deceived by the lies which they themselves had chosen. So it ever is with man. Man must either "love God's law and hate and abhor lies" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-163.htm">Psalm 119:163</a>, or he will despise God's law and cleave to lies.<p>He first in act "despises" God's law, (and whoso does not keep it, despises it,) and then he must needs be deceived by some idol of his own, which becomes his God. He first chooses willfully his own "lie," that is, whatever he chooses out of God, and then his own "lie" deceives him. So, morally, liars at last believe themselves. So, whatever false maxim anyone has adopted against his conscience, whether in belief or practice, to justify what he wills against the will of God, or to explain away what God reveals and he mislikes, stifling and lying to his conscience, in the end deceives his conscience, and at the last, a man believes that to be true, which, before he had lied to his conscience, he knew to be false. The prophet uses a bold word in speaking of man's dealings with his God, "despises." Man carries on the serpent's first fraud, "Hath God indeed said?" Man would not willingly own, that he is directly at variance with the Mind of God. Man, in his powerlessness, at war with Omnipotence, and, in his limited knowledge, with Omniscience! It were too silly, as well as too terrible.<p>So he smoothes it over to himself, "lying" to himself. "God's word must not be taken so precisely;" "God cannot have meant;" "the Author of nature would not have created us so, if He had meant;" and all the other excuses, by which he would evade owning to himself that he is directly rejecting the Mind of God and trampling it under foot. Scripture draws off the veil. Judah had the law of God, and did not keep it; then, he "despised" it. On the one side was God's will, His Eternal Wisdom, His counsel for man for good; on the other, what debasements! On the one side were God's awful threats, on the other, His exceeding promises. Yet man chose whatever he willed, lying to himself, and acting as though God had never threatened or promised or spoken. This ignoring of God's known Will and law and revelation is to despise them, "as effectually as to curse God to His face" <a href="/job/2-5.htm">Job 2:5</a>. This rejection of God was hereeditary.<p>Their lies were those "after which their fathers walked," in Egypt and from Egypt onward, in the wilderness (see the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-25.htm">Amos 5:25-26</a>) , "making the image of the calf of Egypt and worshiping Baalpeor and Ashtoreth and Baalim." Evil acquires a sort of authority by time. People become inured to evils, to which they have been used. False maxims, undisputed, are thought indisputable. They are in possession; and "possession" is held a good title. The popular error of one generation becomes the axiom of the next. The descent "of the image of the great goddess Diana from Jupiter" or of the Coran, becomes a "thing" which cannot be spoken against" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35-36</a>. The "lies after which the fathers walked" deceive the children. The children canonize the errors of their fathers." Human opinon is as dogmatic as revelation. The second generation of error demands as implicit submission as God's truth.<p>The transmission of error against himself, God says, aggravates its evil, does not excuse it <a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>. "Judah is the Church. In her the prophet reproves whosoever, worshiping his own vices and sins, cometh to have that as a god by which he is overcome; as Peter saith, "Whereby a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage" <a href="/2_peter/2-19.htm">2 Peter 2:19</a>. The covetous worshipeth mammon; the glutton, his belly <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>; the impure, Baalpeor; she who, "living in pleasure, is dead while she liveth" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>, the pleasure in which she liveth." Of such idols the world is full. Every fair form, every idle imagination, everything which gratifies self-love, passion, pride, vanity, intellect, sense, each the most refined or the most debased, is such a "lie," so soon as man loves and regards it more than his God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. From foreign kingdoms he passes to Judah and Israel, lest it should be said, he was strenuous in denouncing sins abroad, but connived at those of his own nation.

The prophet proceeds from the Heathens round about to the people of God themselves, for the ill usage of whom chiefly the above nations are threatened with ruin, lest they should promise themselves impunity in sin; though, if they rightly considered things, they could not expect it; since, if the Heathens, ignorant of the will of God, and his law, were punished for their sins, then much more those who knew it, and did it not, <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47</a>; and he begins with Judah, partly because he was of that tribe, lest he should be charged with flattery and partiality, and partly because of the order of his prophecy, which being chiefly concerned with Israel, it was proper that what he had to say to Judah should be delivered first: <p>and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; the prophet retains the same form as in his prophecies against the Heathen nations; his own people, and God's professing people, being guilty of numerous transgressions, as well as they, and more aggravated than theirs; See Gill on <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>; <p>because they have despised the law of the Lord; a law so holy, just, and good, and so righteous, as no other nation had; and yet was not only not observed, but contemned: other nations sinned against the light of nature, and are not charged with breaches of the law of God, which was not given them; but these people had it, yet lightly esteemed it; counted it as a strange thing; walked not according to it, but cast it away from them; which was a great affront to the sovereignty of God, and a trampling upon his legislative power and authority: <p>and have not kept his commandments; or "statutes" (p); the ordinances of the ceremonial law, which he appointed them to observe for the honour of his name, as parts of his worship; and to lead them into the designs of his grace and salvation by the Messiah: <p>and their lies caused them to err; either, their idols, as the Vulgate Latin version renders it; which are lying vanities, and deceive, and by which they were made to err from the pure worship of the living and true God to superstition and idolatry; or the words of the false prophets, as Kimchi; the false doctrines their taught, contrary to the word of God, directing them to seek for life by their own works; and promising them peace, when destruction was at hand; and daubing with untempered mortar; and as no lie is of the truth, but against it, so one untruth leads on to another: <p>after the which their fathers have walked; after which lies, idols, and errors, as in Ur of the Chaldees, in Egypt, in the wilderness, and even in later times: this was no excuse to them that they followed the way of their ancestors, but rather an aggravation of their guilt, that they imitated them, took no warning by them; but filled up the measure of their iniquities, and showed themselves to be a seed of evildoers, a generation of wicked men, the sons of rebellious parents. <p>(p) "statuta ejus", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/amos/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</span><p>(b) Seeing that the Gentiles who did have as much knowledge were punished in this way, Judah which was so fully instructed by the Lord's will, should not think that they would escape.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/amos/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">despised</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">rejected</span>,—as <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.

Here the context (comp. the note on <span class="ital">lies</span>, in the same verse), and the importance which Amos uniformly attaches to <span class="ital">moral</span> duties, make it probable that, like Isaiah and Jeremiah, he means by the term spiritual and moral teaching, uttered, whether by priests or prophets, in Jehovah’s name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[219] The root <span class="ital">yârâh</span> signifies, however, properly <span class="ital">to throw</span> or <span class="ital">cast</span> (<a href="/exodus/15-4.htm" title="Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.">Exodus 15:4</a>); and hence it is quite possible that the primitive meaning of <span class="ital">hôrâh</span>, in this connexion, was to <span class="ital">cast</span> the sacred lot at a sanctuary, for the purpose of ascertaining the will of the deity on behalf of those who came to consult it.

It remained a principal duty of the Israelitish priest to teach Jehovah’s <span class="ital">Tôrâh</span>, though this particular method of ascertaining it fell no doubt early into abeyance, and the term acquired a more general sense.

According to my desire shall I chastise them; and nations will be gathered together against them, to bind them to their two transgressions." Just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a>, the days of Gibeah, i.e., the days when that ruthless crime was committed at Gibeah upon the concubine of the Levite, are mentioned as a time of deep corruption; so are those days described in the present passage as the commencement of Israel's sin. For it is as obvious that &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497; is not to be understood in a comparative sense, as it is that the days of Gibeah are not to be taken as referring to the choice of Saul, who sprang from Gibeah, to be their king (Chald.). The following words, &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1490;&#1490;&#1493;, which are very difficult, and have been variously explained, do not describe the conduct of Israel in those days; for, in the first place, the statement that the war did not overtake them is by no means in harmony with this, since the other tribes avenged that crime so severely that the tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated; and secondly, the suffix attached to &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1501; evidently refers to the same persons as that appended to &#1488;&#1505;&#1468;'&#1512;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, i.e., to the Israelites of the ten tribes, to which Hosea foretels the coming judgment. These are therefore the subject to &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, and consequently &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; signifies to stand, to remain, to persevere (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a>). There, in Gibeah, did they remain, that is to say, they persevered in the sin of Gibeah, without the war at Gibeah against the sinners overtaking them (the imperfect, in a subordinated clause, used to describe the necessary consequence; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; transposed from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; mo, like &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a> for &#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;). The meaning is, that since the days of Gibeah the Israelites persist in the same sin as the Gibeahites; but whereas those sinners were punished and destroyed by the war, the ten tribes still live on in the same sin without having been destroyed by any similar war. Jehovah will now chastise them for it. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, in my desire, equivalent to according to my wish - an anthropomorphic description of the severity of the chastisement. &#1493;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;'&#1512;&#1501; from &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; (according to Ewald, 139, a), with the Vav of the apodosis. The chastisement will consist in the fact, that nations will be gathered together against Israel &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1512;&#1501;, lit., at their binding, i.e., when I shall bind them. The chethib &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; cannot well be the plural of &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, because the plural &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not used for the eyes; and the rendering, "before their two eyes," in the sense of "without their being able to prevent it" (Ewald), yields the unheard-of conception of binding a person before his own eyes; and, moreover, the use of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; instead of the simple dual would still be left unexplained. We must therefore give the preference to the keri &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;, and regard the chethib as another form, that may be accounted for from the transition of the verbs &#1506;&#1497; into &#1506;&#1493;, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514; as a contraction of &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;, since &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; cannot be shown to have either the meaning of "sorrow" (Chald., A. E.), or that of the severe labour of "tributary service." And, moreover, neither of these meanings would give us a suitable thought; whilst the very same objection may be brought against the supposition that the doubleness of the work refers to Ephraim and Judah, which has been brought against the rendering "to bind to his furrows," viz., that it would be non solum ineptum, sed locutionis monstrum. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501;, "to their two transgression" to bind them: i.e., to place them in connection with the transgressions by the punishment, so that they will be obliged to drag them along like beasts of burden. By the two transgressions we are to understand neither the two golden calves at Bethel and Daniel (Hitzig), nor unfaithfulness towards Jehovah and devotedness to idols, after <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> (Cyr., Theod.); but their apostasy from Jehovah and the royal house of David, in accordance with <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, where it is distinctly stated that the ultimate conversion of the nation will consist in its seeking Jehovah and David their king. </body></html>
