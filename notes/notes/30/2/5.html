Those that deal cruelly, shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God. Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile idolatry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will send a fire upon Judah - All know now, how Jerusalem, its temple, and its palaces perished by fire, first by Nebuchadnezzar, then by the Romans.

So we know that a "fiery stream" <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a> will issue and come forth from Him; "a fire" that "consumeth to destruction" <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-12.htm">Job 31:12</a>, all who, whether or no they are in the body of the Church, are not of the heavenly Jerusalem; dead members in the body which belongs to the Living Head.

"Since the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel: there have they remained: the war against the sons of wickedness did not overtake them at Gibeah. <a href="/hosea/10-10.htm">Hosea 10:10</a>. According to my desire shall I chastise them; and nations will be gathered together against them, to bind them to their two transgressions." Just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a>, the days of Gibeah, i.e., the days when that ruthless crime was committed at Gibeah upon the concubine of the Levite, are mentioned as a time of deep corruption; so are those days described in the present passage as the commencement of Israel's sin. For it is as obvious that &#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497; is not to be understood in a comparative sense, as it is that the days of Gibeah are not to be taken as referring to the choice of Saul, who sprang from Gibeah, to be their king (Chald.). The following words, &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1490;&#1490;&#1493;, which are very difficult, and have been variously explained, do not describe the conduct of Israel in those days; for, in the first place, the statement that the war did not overtake them is by no means in harmony with this, since the other tribes avenged that crime so severely that the tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated; and secondly, the suffix attached to &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;&#1501; evidently refers to the same persons as that appended to &#1488;&#1505;&#1468;'&#1512;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, i.e., to the Israelites of the ten tribes, to which Hosea foretels the coming judgment. These are therefore the subject to &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, and consequently &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; signifies to stand, to remain, to persevere (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a>). There, in Gibeah, did they remain, that is to say, they persevered in the sin of Gibeah, without the war at Gibeah against the sinners overtaking them (the imperfect, in a subordinated clause, used to describe the necessary consequence; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; transposed from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; mo, like &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a> for &#1494;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;). The meaning is, that since the days of Gibeah the Israelites persist in the same sin as the Gibeahites; but whereas those sinners were punished and destroyed by the war, the ten tribes still live on in the same sin without having been destroyed by any similar war. Jehovah will now chastise them for it. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, in my desire, equivalent to according to my wish - an anthropomorphic description of the severity of the chastisement. &#1493;&#1488;&#1505;&#1468;'&#1512;&#1501; from &#1497;&#1505;&#1512; (according to Ewald, 139, a), with the Vav of the apodosis. The chastisement will consist in the fact, that nations will be gathered together against Israel &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1512;&#1501;, lit., at their binding, i.e., when I shall bind them. The chethib &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501; cannot well be the plural of &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, because the plural &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not used for the eyes; and the rendering, "before their two eyes," in the sense of "without their being able to prevent it" (Ewald), yields the unheard-of conception of binding a person before his own eyes; and, moreover, the use of &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; instead of the simple dual would still be left unexplained. We must therefore give the preference to the keri &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;, and regard the chethib as another form, that may be accounted for from the transition of the verbs &#1506;&#1497; into &#1506;&#1493;, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514; as a contraction of &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;, since &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; cannot be shown to have either the meaning of "sorrow" (Chald., A. E.), or that of the severe labour of "tributary service." And, moreover, neither of these meanings would give us a suitable thought; whilst the very same objection may be brought against the supposition that the doubleness of the work refers to Ephraim and Judah, which has been brought against the rendering "to bind to his furrows," viz., that it would be non solum ineptum, sed locutionis monstrum. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1501;, "to their two transgression" to bind them: i.e., to place them in connection with the transgressions by the punishment, so that they will be obliged to drag them along like beasts of burden. By the two transgressions we are to understand neither the two golden calves at Bethel and Daniel (Hitzig), nor unfaithfulness towards Jehovah and devotedness to idols, after <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> (Cyr., Theod.); but their apostasy from Jehovah and the royal house of David, in accordance with <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>, where it is distinctly stated that the ultimate conversion of the nation will consist in its seeking Jehovah and David their king. </body></html>
