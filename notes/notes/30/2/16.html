They had helps for their souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthly enjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers are great blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to be so. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wanting to them in the means of grace. They did what they could to lead believers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds of young people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them to the love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudes of young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erred through strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complains of sin, especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden to him. And though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and so the sinner will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, adding obstinacy to sin, and this becomes the general character of a people, they will be given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boasted power and resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, for all our ingratitude and unfaithfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Israel relied, against God, on his own strength. "Have we not," they said, "taken to us horns by our own strength?" <a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>. Amos tells them then, that every means of strength, resistance, flight, swiftness of foot, of horse, place of refuge, should fail them. Three times he repeats, as a sort of dirge, "he shall not deliver himself."<p>Therefore the flight shall perish - (Probably place of flight <a href="/job/11-20.htm">Job 11:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-35.htm">Jeremiah 25:35</a>). They had despised God, as their "place of refuge" , so "the place of refuge, should perish from the swift," as though it were not. He should flee amain, but there would be no "place to flee unto." God alone "renews strength;" therefore "the strong" man should not "strengthen his force or might," should not be able to gather or "collect his strength"  as we say. Fear should disable him. "The handler of the bow" (as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>), and who by habit is a skilled archer, although himself out of the immediate reach of the enemy, and able, unharmed, to annoy him and protect the fugitives, "shall not stand" (as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a>; <a href="/nahum/2-8.htm">Nahum 2:8</a>). Panic should overtake him. The "mighty" man, the "fleet of foot" should "not deliver," yea, "the horseman" should not "deliver himself;" yea, he who, "among the mighty," was "strongest of his heart," firm-souled among those of mightiest prowess, "shall flee away naked," that is, bared of all, armor  or dress, which might encumber his flight "in that day" which the Lord made a day of terror His own day.<p>Saith the Lord - Probably literally, "the secret utterance  of the Lord." Amos, more than Hosea, uses this special authentication of his words , which is so common in Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah. He claims a knowledge, which those around him had not, and ratifies it by the express appeal to the direct, though secret, revelation of God; what those who were not of God, would deny; what they who were of God, would believe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. flee &#8230; naked&#8212;If any escape, it must be with the loss of accoutrements, and all that would impede rapid flight.

"It will not return into the land of Egypt; but Asshur, he is its king, because they refused to return. <a href="/hosea/11-6.htm">Hosea 11:6</a>. And the sword will sweep round in its cities, and destroy its bolts, and devour, because of their counsels. <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>. My people is bent upon apostasy from me: and if men call it upwards, it does not raise itself at all." The apparent contradiction between the words, "It will not return into the land of Egypt," and the threat contained in <a href="/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, that Israel should return to Egypt, ought not to lead us to resort to alterations of the text, or to take &#1500;&#1488; in the sense of &#1500;&#1493;, and connect it with the previous verse, as is done by the lxx, Mang., and others, or to make an arbitrary paraphrase of the words, either by taking &#1500;&#1488; in the sense of &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, and rendering it as a question, "Should it not return?" equivalent to "it will certainly return" (Maurer, Ewald, etc.); or by understanding the return to Egypt as signifying the longing of the people for help from Egypt (Rosenmller). The emphatic &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; of the second clause is at variance with all these explanations, since they not only fail to explain it, but it points unmistakeably to an antithesis: "Israel will not return to Egypt; but Asshur, it shall be its king," i.e., it shall come under the dominion of Assyria. The supposed contradiction is removed as soon as we observe that in <a href="/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>, Egypt is a type of the land of bondage; whereas here the typical interpretation is precluded partly by the contrast to Asshur, and still more by the correspondence in which the words stand to <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>. Into the land from which Jehovah called His people, Israel shall not return, lest it should appear as though the object, for which it had been brought out of Egypt and conducted miraculously through the desert, had been frustrated by the impenitence of the people. But it is to be brought into another bondage. &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is appended adversatively. Asshur shall rule over it as king, because they refuse to return, sc. to Jehovah. The Assyrians will wage war against the land, and conquer it. The sword (used as a principal weapon, to denote the destructive power of war) will circulate in the cities of Israel, make the round of the cities as it were, and destroy its bolts, i.e., the bolts of the gates of the fortifications of Ephraim. Badd&#305;&#772;m, poles (<a href="/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13</a>.), cross-poles or cross-beams, with which the gates were fastened, hence bolts in the literal sense, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm">Job 17:16</a>, and not tropically for "princes" (Ges.), electi (Jer., Chald., etc.). "On account of their counsels:" this is more fully defined in <a href="/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>. &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, and my people ( equals  since my people) are harnessed to apostasy from me (meshu&#772;bha&#770;th&#305;&#772;, with an objective suffix). &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, lit., suspended on apostasy, i.e., not "swaying about in consequence of apostasy or in constant danger of falling away" (Chald., Syr., Hengst.), since this would express too little in the present context and would not suit the second half of the verse, but impaled or fastened upon apostasy as upon a stake, so that it cannot get loose. Hence the constructing of &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; with &#1500; instead of &#1506;&#1500; or &#1489; (<a href="/2_samuel/18-10.htm">2 Samuel 18:10</a>), may be accounted for from the use of the verb in a figurative sense. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1500;, upwards (&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="/hosea/7-16.htm">Hosea 7:16</a>), do they (the prophets: see <a href="/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>) call them; but it does not rise, sc. to return to God, or seek help from on high. &#1512;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; pilel, with the meaning of the kal intensified, to make a rising, i.e., to rise up. This explanation appears simpler than supplying an object, say "the soul" (<a href="/psalms/25-1.htm">Psalm 25:1</a>), or "the eyes" (<a href="/ezekiel/33-25.htm">Ezekiel 33:25</a>). </body></html>
