For the fire destroys not the natural buildings only, but "the house of Hazael," that is, his whole family. In these prophecies, a sevenfold vengeance by fire is denounced against the seven people, an image of the eternal fire into which all iniquity shall be cast.<p>The palaces of Benhadad - Hazael, having murdered Benhadad his master and ascended his throne, called Iris son after his murdered master, probably in order to connect his own house with the ancient dynasty. Benhadad, that is, son or worshiper of the idol "Hadad," or "the sun," had been the name of two of the kings of the old dynasty. Benhadad III was at this time reigning. The prophet foretells the entire destruction of the dynasty founded in blood. The prophecy may have had a fulfillment in the destruction of the house of Hazael, with whose family Rezin, the king of Syria in the time of Ahaz, stands in no known relation. Defeats, such as those of Benhadad III by Jeroboam II who took Damascus itself, are often the close of an usurping dynasty. Having no claim to regard except success, failure vitiates its only title. The name Hazael, "whom God looked upon," implies a sort of owning of the One God, like Tab-el, "God is good," El-iada', "whom God knoweth," even amid the idolatry in the names, Tab-Rimmon, "good is Rimmon;" Hadad-ezer, "Hadad is help;" and Hadad, or Benhadad. Bad men abuse every creature, or ordinance, or appointment of God. It may be then that, as Sennacherib boasted, "am I now come up without the Lord against this land" to destroy it? the Lord said unto me, Go up against this land and destroy it" <a href="/isaiah/36-10.htm">Isaiah 36:10</a>; so Hazael made use of the prophecy of Elisha, to give himself out as the scourge of God, and thought of himself as one "on whom God looked."<p>Knowledge of futurity is an awful gift. As "Omniscience alone can wield Omnipotence," so superhuman knowledge needs superhuman gifts of wisdom and holiness. Hazael seemingly hardened himself in sin by aid of the knowledge which should have been his warning. Probably he came to Elisha, with the intent to murder his master already formed, in case he should not die a natural death; and Elisha read him to himself. But he very probably justified himself to himself in what he had already purposed to do, on the ground that Elisha had foretold to him that he should be king over <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>, and, in his massacres of God's people, gave himself out as being, what he was, the instrument of God. "Scourges of God" have known themselves to be what they were, although they themselves were not the less sinful, in sinfully accomplishing the Will of God (see the note at <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>). We have heard of a Christian Emperor, who has often spoken of his "mission," although his "mission" has already cost the shedding of much Christian blood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Hazael &#8230; Ben-hadad&#8212;A black marble obelisk found in the central palace of Nimroud, and now in the British Museum, is inscribed with the names of Hazael and Ben-hadad of Syria, as well as Jehu of Israel, mentioned as tributaries of "Shalmanubar," king of Assyria. The kind of tribute from Jehu is mentioned: gold, pearls, precious oil, &c. [G. V. Smith]. The Ben-hadad here is the son of Hazael (2Ki 13:3), not the Ben-hadad supplanted and slain by Hazael (2Ki 8:7, 15).

Pliny speaks of a god worshipped by the Syrians, whose name must be Adad; since, according to him; the gem "adadunephros" had its name from him (e); and Macrobius (f) is express for it, that the chief god of the Assyrians was called Adad, which signifies one; See Gill on <a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>. <p>(c) Antiqu. l. 9. c. 4. sect. 6.

There were three kings of Syria named Benhadad. The first of the name made alliance with Asa, and fought successfully against Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>); Benhadad II. was the contemporary of Ahab, and carded on war for many years with the northern kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>). He was murdered either by Hazael or his servants (<a href="/2_kings/8-15.htm">2 Kings 8:15</a>). Benhadad III., the son of Hazael, was a monarch of small ability, and Syria under his sway sank into insignificance (<a href="/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a>, etc.; 2 Kings 14:27; 15:17). All this happened before the time of Amos, who probably refers to all the kings of that name, Benhadad, "Son of the Sun," being the title of the dynasty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is very evident that this is what he has in his mind, and that he regards the apostasy of the ten tribes as merely a continuation of that particular idolatry, from the punishment which is announced in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a>, as about to fall upon Ephraim in consequence. <a href="/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>.
