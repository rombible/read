But even to this day there is a village, called Teman, about 5 (Eusebius says 15) miles from Petra, where there is also a Roman garrison, from which place was Eliphaz, king of the Themanites." It is, however, probably the district which is meant, of which Bozra was then the capital. For Amos when speaking of cities, uses some word to express this, as "the palaces of Benhadad, the wall of Gaza, of Tyrus, of Rabbah;" here he simply uses the name Teman, as he does those of Moab and Judah. Amos does not mention Petra, or Selah, for Amaziah had taken it, and called it Joktheel, "which God subdued," which name it for some time retained <a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>.<p>Bozrah - (Literally, which cuts off approach) is mentioned, as early as Genesis Gen 36:33, as the seat of one of the elective kings who, in times before Moses, reigned over Edom. It lay then doubtless in Idumea itself, and is quite distinct from the Bozrah of Hauran or Auranitis, from which Jerome also distinguishes it. : "There is another Bosor also, a city of Esau, in the mountains of Idumea, of which Isaiah speaks." There is yet a small village of the like name (Busaira "the little Bozrah") which "appears," it is said , "to have been in ancient times a considerable city, if we may judge from the ruins which surround the village." It has now "some 50 houses, and stands on an elevation, on the summit of which a small castle has been built." The name however, "little Bozrah," indicates the existence of a "great Bozrah," with which its name is contrasted, and is not likely to have been the place itself . Probably the name was a common one, "the strong place" of its neighborhood . The Bozrah of Edom is either that little vilage, or is wholly blotted out. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

It may be there might be two cities of this name, the one in Moab, the other in Edom, or Idumea; however, this was a very strong city, and one of the chiefest in the whole kingdom, so that in the menace against Bozrah and Teman the strength and glory of Edom is threatened with an utter overthrow, as of that which is burnt up by fire. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/amos/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I will send a fire upon Teman,.... A principal city of Edom or Idumea, so called from Teman a grandson of Esau, <a href="/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>. Jerom (x) says there was in his time a village called Theman, five miles distant from the city Petra, and had a Roman garrison; and so says Eusebius (y); who places it in Arabia Petraea; it is put for the whole country; it signifies the south. So the Targum renders it, <p>"a fire in the south.'' <p>The "fire" signifies an enemy that should be sent into it, and destroy it: this was Nebuchadnezzar, who, as Josephus (z) says, five years after the destruction of Jerusalem led his army into Coelesyria, and took it; and fought against the Ammonites and Moabites, and very probably at the same time against the Edomites: <p>which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah; another famous city of the Edomites; there was one of this name in Moab; either there were two cities so called, one in Edom, and another in Moab; or rather this city lay, as Jarchi says, between Edom and Moab; and so sometimes is placed to one, and sometimes to another, its it might belong to the one and to the other, according to the event of war. It is the same with Bezer in the wilderness, appointed a Levitical city, and a city of refuge, by Joshua, <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; and belonged to the tribe of Reuben; but being on the borders of that tribe, and of Moab and Edom, it is ascribed to each, as they at different times made themselves masters of it. It is the same with Bostra, which Ptolemy (a) places in Arabia Petraea; and being on the confines of Arabia Deserts, and surrounded on all sides with wild deserts, it is commonly spoken of as situated in a wilderness, Jerom (b) speaks of it as a city of Arabia in the desert, to the south, looking to Damascus; and, according to the Persian (c) geographer, it is four days' journey southward from Damascus; and Eusebius places it at the distance of twenty four miles from Adraa or Edrei. The destruction of this place is prophesied of by Jeremiah, <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>; and perhaps these prophecies were accomplished when Nebuchadnezzar made war with the Ammonites and Edomites, as before observed; or however in the times of the Maccabees, when Judas Maccabeus took this city, put all the males to the sword, plundered it, and then set fire to it, which literally fulfilled this prophecy, <p>"Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire,'' (1 Maccabees 5:28) <p>It was afterwards rebuilt, and became a considerable city; in the time of the above Persian geographer (d), it had a very strong castle belonging to it, a gate twenty cubits high, and one of the largest basins or pools of water in all the east. In the fourth century there were bishops of this place, which assisted in the councils of Nice, Antioch, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, as Reland (e) observes; though he thinks that Bostra is not to be confounded with the Bezer of Reuben, or with the Bozra of Moab and Edom; though they seem to be all one and the same place. <p>(x) De locis Hebr. fol. 95.

A. Smith (p. 129 f.); the former supposes it to be an addition to the original text of Amos, dating from the Chaldaean age. Not only is there in the earlier prophets and historical books no other evidence of such animus against Edom as here displays itself, but Edom, when Amos wrote, had been for two centuries under the yoke of Judah; its first subjection had been accomplished with great cruelty (<a href="/1_kings/11-16.htm" title="(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)">1 Kings 11:16</a>); Amaziah, also, more recently (801–792 b.c.), had severely smitten Edom (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2 Kings 14:7</a>). Even, therefore, although Edom had shewn itself unfriendly, “was the right to blame them Judah’s, who herself had so persistently waged war, with confessed cruelty, against Edom? Could a Judaean prophet be just in blaming Edom and saying nothing of Judah?… To charge Edom, whom Judah had conquered and treated cruelly, with restless hate towards Judah seems to fall below that high impartial tone which prevails in the other oracles of this section. The charge was much more justifiable at the time of the Exile, when Edom did behave shamefully towards Israel” (G. A. Smith, p. 130). The argument is a forcible one, and the conclusion to which it points <span class="ital">may</span> be the true one: our ignorance, as the same writer proceeds to point out, prohibits our endorsing it absolutely: we do not for instance know the particulars of the revolt under Jehoram or what may have happened to provoke Amaziah’s attack upon Edom, or indeed what, generally, may have been Edom’s behaviour towards Judah during the century before Amos: there may have been occurrences during this period known to Amos and sufficient to justify the words used by him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Teman is the region of Idumaea, of which Bozrah is the capital.

The monologue of Obadiah has been already referred to. The instrument of vengeance in the present ease was Nebuchadnezzar, though it suffered much at the hands of other enemies, as the Nabathaeans and Maccabees. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In a fresh turn the concluding thought of the last strophe (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>) is resumed, and the guilt and punishment of Israel still more fully described in two sections, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1-8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-9.htm">Hosea 10:9-15</a>. <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>. "Israel is a running vine; it set fruit for itself: the more of its fruit, the more altars did it prepare; the better its land, the better pillars did they make. <a href="/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>. Smooth was their heart, ow will they atone. He will break in pieces their altars, desolate their pillars. <a href="/hosea/10-3.htm">Hosea 10:3</a>. Yea, now will they say, No king to us! for we feared not Jehovah; and the king, what shall he do to us?" Under the figure of a vine running luxuriantly, which did indeed set some good fruit, but bore no sound ripe grapes, the prophet describes Israel as a glorious plantation of God Himself, which did not answer the expectations of its Creator. The figure is simply sketched in a few bold lines. We have an explanatory parallel in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9-12</a>. The participle bo&#772;qe&#772;q does not mean "empty" or "emptying out" here; for this does not suit the next clause, according to which the fruit was set, but from the primary meaning of ba&#770;qaq, to pour out, pouring itself out, overflowing, i.e., running luxuriantly. It has the same meaning, therefore, as &#1490; &#1505;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>, that which extends its branches far and wide, that is to say, grows most vigorously. The next sentence, "it set fruit," still belongs to the figure; but in the third sentence the figure passes over into a literal prophecy. According to the abundance of its fruit, Israel made many altars; and in proportion to the goodness of its land, it made better &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, Baal's pillars (see at <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>); i.e., as Israel multiplied, and under the blessing of God attained to prosperity, wealth, and power in the good land (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), it forgot its God, and fell more and more into idolatry (cf. <a href="/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>, <a href="/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a>). The reason of all this was, that their heart was smooth, i.e., dissimulating, not sincerely devoted to the Lord, inasmuch as, under the appearance of devotedness to God, they still clung to idols (for the fact, see <a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9</a>). The word cha&#770;la&#770;q, to be smooth, was mostly applied by a Hebrew to the tongue, lip, mouth, throat, and speech (<a href="/psalms/5-10.htm">Psalm 5:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>), and not to the heart. But in <a href="/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a> we read of smooth, i.e., deceitful prophesying; and there is all the more reason for retaining the meaning "smooth" here, that the rendering "their heart is divided," which is supported by the ancient versions, cannot be grammatically defended. For cha&#770;la&#770;q is not used in kal in an intransitive sense; and the active rendering, "He (i.e., God) has divided their heart" (Hitzig), gives an unscriptural thought. They will now atone for this, for God will destroy their altars and pillars. &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, "to break the neck of the altars," is a bold expression, applied to the destruction of the altars by breaking off the horns (compare <a href="/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>). Then will the people see and be compelled to confess that it has no longer a king, because it has not feared the Lord, since the king who has been set up in opposition to the will of the Lord (<a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>) cannot bring either help or deliverance (<a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to do, i.e., to help or be of use to a person (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:2</a>). </body></html>
