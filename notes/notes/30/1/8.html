These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod - Ashdod, as well as Ekron, have their names from their strength; Ashdod, "the mighty," like Valentia; Ekron, "the firm-rooted." The title of Ashdod implied that it was powerful to inflict as to resist. It may have meant, "the waster." It too was eminent in its idolatry. The ark, when taken, was first placed in its Dagon-temple <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-7</a>; and, perhaps, in consequence, its lord is placed first of the five, in recounting the trespass-offerings which they sent to the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a>. Ashdod (Azotus in the New Testament now a village, Esdud or Shdood ), lay 34 or 36 miles from Gaza , on the great route from Egypt northward, on that which now too is most used even to Jerusalem. Ashkelon lay to the left of the road, near the sea, rather more than halfway.<p>Ekron (Akir, now a village of 50 mud-houses ), lay a little to the right of the road northward from Gaza to Lydda (in the same latitude as Jamnia, Jabneel) on the road from Ramleh to Belt Jibrin (Eleutheropolis). Ekron, the furthest from the sea, lay only 15 miles from it. They were then a succession of fortresses, strong from their situation, which could molest any army, which should come along their coast. Transversely, in regard to Judah, they enclosed a space parallel to most of Judah and Benjamin. Ekron, which by God's gift was the northern line of Judah <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-11.htm">Joshua 15:11</a>, is about the same latitude as Ramah in Benjamin; Gaza, the same as Carmel (Kurmul). From Gaza lay a straight road to Jerusalem; but Ashkelon too, Ashdod, and Ekron lay near the heads of valleys, which ran up to the hill-country near Jerusalem .<p>This system of rich valleys, in which, either by artificial irrigation or natural absorption, the streams which ran from the mountains of Judah westward fertilized the grainfields of Philistia, aforded equally a ready approach to Philistine marauders into the very heart of Judah. The Crusaders had to crown with castles the heights in a distant circle around Ashkelon , in order to restrain the incursions of the Muslims. (In such occasions doubtless, the same man-stealing was often practiced on lesser scales, which here, on a larger scale, draws down the sentence of God. Gath, much further inland, probably formed a center to which these maritime towns converged, and united their system of inroads on Judah.<p>These five cities of Philistia had each its own petty king (Seren, our "axle"). But all formed one whole; all debated and acted together on any great occasion; as in the plot against Samson <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-8.htm">Judges 16:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-18.htm">Judges 16:18</a>, the sacrifice to Dagon in triumph over him, where they perished <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-27.htm">Judges 16:27</a>, <a href="/judges/16-30.htm">Judges 16:30</a>; the inflictions on account of the ark <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/5-11.htm">1 Samuel 5:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-16.htm">1 Samuel 6:16</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>; the great attack on Israel <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>, which God defeated the Mizpeh; the battle when Saul fell, and the dismissal of David <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6-7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19</a>. The cities divided their idolatry also, in a manner, between them, Ashdod being the chief seat of the worship of Dagon , Ashkelon, of the corresponding worship of Derceto , the fish-goddess, the symbol of the passive principle in re-production. Ekron was the seat of the worship of Baalzebub and his oracle, from where he is called "the god of Ekron" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2-3</a>, <a href="/2_kings/1-16.htm">2 Kings 1:16</a>.<p>Gaza, even after it had become an abode of Greek idolatry and had seven temples of Greek gods, still retained its worship of its god Marna ("our Lord") as the chief . It too was probably "nature"  and to its worship they were devoted. All these cities were as one; all formed one state; all were one in their sin; all were to be one in their punishment. So then for greater vividness, one part of the common infliction is related of each, while in fact, according to the custom of prophetic diction, what is said of each is said of all. King and people were to be cut off from all; all were to be consumed with fire in war; on all God would, as it were, "turn" (literally, "bring back") His Hand, visiting them anew, and bringing again the same punishment upon them. In truth these destructions came upon them, again and again, through Sargon, Hezekiah, Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander, the Maccabees.<p>Ashdod - Uzziah about this time "brake down its walls and built cities about" <a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a> it, to protect his people from its inroads. It recovered, and was subsequently besieged and taken by Tartan, the Assyrian General under Sargon <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a> (about 716 b.c.). Somewhat later, it sustained the longest siege in man's knowlege, for 29 years, from Psammetichus  king of Egypt (about 635 b.c.). Whence, probably Jeremiah, while he speaks of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, mentions "the remnant of Ashdod" <a href="/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a> only. Yet, after the captivity, it seems to have been the first Philistine city, so that the Philistines were called Ashdodites <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7</a>, and their dialect Ashdodite <a href="/nehemiah/13-24.htm">Nehemiah 13:24</a>. They were still hostile to the Jews <a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7</a>. The war, in which Judas Maccabaeus spoiled Ashdod and other Philistine cities (1 Macc. 5:68), was a defensive war against a war of extermination. "The nations round about" (1 Macc. 5:1, 2), it is said at the beginning of the account of that year's campaign, "thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that was among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the people." Jonathan, the brother of Judas, "set fire to Azotus and the cities round about it (1 Macc. 10:82, 84), after a battle under its walls, to which his enemies had challenged him. The temple of Dagon in it was a sort of citadel (1 Macc. 10:83).<p>Ashkelon is mentioned as a place of strength, taken by the great conqueror, Raamses II. Its resolute defense and capture are represented, with its name as a city of Canaanites, on a monument of Karnac . Its name most naturally signifies "hanging." This suits very well with the site of its present ruins, which "hang" on the side of the theater or arc of hills, whose base is the sea. This, however, probably was not its ancient site (see the note at <a href="/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>). Its name occurs in the wars of the Maccabees, but rather as submitting readily (1 Macc. 10:86; 11:60). Perhaps the inhabitants had been changed in the intervening period. Antipater, the Edomite father of Herod, courted, we are told , "the Arabs and the Ascalonites and the Gazites." "Toward the Jews their neighbors, the inhabitants of the Holy land," Philo says  to the Roman emperor, "the Ascalonites have an irreconcilable aversion, which will come to no terms." This abiding hatred  burst out at the beginning of the war with the Romans, in which Jerusalem perished. The Ascalonites massacred 2500 Jews dwelling among them . The Jews "fired Ascalon and utterly destroyed Gaza" .<p>Ekron was apparently not important enough in itself to have any separate history. We hear of it only as given by Alexander Bales "with the borders thereof in possession" (1 Macc. 10:89) to Jonathan the Maccabee. The valley of Surar gave the Ekronites a readier entrance into the center of Judaea, than Ascalon or Ashdod had. In Jerome's time, it had sunk to "a very large village."<p>The residue of the Philistines shall perish - This has been thought to mean "the rest" (as in <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-72.htm">Nehemiah 7:72</a>) that is, Gath, (not mentioned by name anymore as having ceased to be of any account (see the note at <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>)) and the towns, dependent on those chief cities . The common (and, with a proper name, universal ) meaning of the idiom is, "the remnant," those who remain over after a first destruction. The words then, like those just before, "I will bring again my hand against Ekron," foretell a renewal of those first judgments. The political strength which should survive one desolation should be destroyed in those which should succeed it. In tacit contrast with the promises of mercy to the remnant of Judah (see above the note at <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>), Amos foretells that judgment after judgment should fall upon Philistia, until the Philistines ceased to be anymore a people; as they did. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Ashdod, &c.&#8212;Gath alone is not mentioned of the five chief Philistine cities. It had already been subdued by David; and it, as well as Ashdod, was taken by Uzziah (2Ch 26:6). Gath perhaps had lost its position as one of the five primary cities before Amos uttered this prophecy, whence arose his omission of it. So Zep 2:4, 5. Compare Jer 47:4; Eze 25:16. Subsequently to the subjugation of the Philistines by Uzziah, and then by Hezekiah, they were reduced by Psammetichus of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar, the Persians, Alexander, and lastly the Asmoneans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/amos/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The inhabitant:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/amos/1-5.htm" title="I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.">Amos 1:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ashdod:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/zephaniah/2-4.htm" title="For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.">Zephaniah 2:4</a> <a href="/zechariah/9-6.htm" title="And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.">Zechariah 9:6</a></span>.

(1 Maccabees 10) <p>this was so strong a place, that, according to Herodotus (t), it held out a siege of twenty nine years, under Psammitichus king of Egypt. It was, according to Diodorus Siculus (u), thirty four miles, from Gaza before mentioned; and it was about eight or nine from Ashkelon, and fourteen or fifteen from Ekron after mentioned: <p>and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; another of the five lordships of the Philistines, whose king or governor should be cut off, with the inhabitants of it; this was done by Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>. This place was about fifteen miles from Gaza, Mr. Sandys (w) says ten, but it was eight or nine miles from Ashdod; and, as Josephus (x) says, was sixty five miles from Jerusalem. It was the birth place of Herod the great, who from thence is called an Ashkelonite; but the king or governor of it was cut off before his time. It was governed by kings formerly. Justin (y) makes mention of a king of Ashkelon; according to the Samaritan interpreter, <a href="/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1</a>; it is the same with Gerar, which had a king in the times of Abraham; hence a sceptre is here ascribed to it: <p>and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: to destroy that; another of the chief cities of the Philistines. It was about ten miles from Gath; four of the five lordships are here mentioned, but not Gath, which was the fifth; see <a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a>; because, as Kimchi says, it was in the hands of Judah. All these places were inhabited by Heathens, and guilty of gross idolatry, which must be one of the transgressions for which they were punished. Gaza was a place much given to idolatry, as it was even in later times; when other neighbouring cities embraced the Christian religion, the inhabitants of it were violent persecutors; hence that saying of Gregory Nazianzen (z), <p>"who knows not the madness of the inhabitants of Gaza?'' <p>here stood the temple of the god Marnas (a), which with the Syrians signified the lord of men: at Ashdod or Azotus stood the temple of Dagon, where he was worshipped, <a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2</a>; <p>"But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire.'' (1 Maccabees 10:84) <p>Near Ashkelon, as Diodorus Siculus (b) relates, was a large and deep lake, full of fishes; and by it was a temple of a famous goddess, called by the Syrians Derceto, who had a woman's face, but the rest of her body in the form of a fish; being, as the fable goes, changed into one upon her casting herself into the above lake on a certain occasion; hence the Syrians abstained from fishes, and worshipped them as gods. Herodotus (c) calls this city a city of Syria, and speaks of a temple dedicated to Urania Venus; and in the Talmud (d) mention is made of the temple of Zeripha, or of a molten image at Ashkelon; and, besides idolatry, this place seems to have been famous for witchcraft; for it is said (e) that Simeon ben Shetach hung on one day at Ashkelon fourscore women for being witches; and, at Ekron, Baalzebub or the god of the fly was worshipped: <p>and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God; all the other towns and cities belonging to them, besides those mentioned; which very likely had its accomplishment in the times of the Maccabees, when they fell into the hands of the Jews. <p>(t) Euterpe, sive l. 2. c. 157.

In the Middle Ages it became the most considerable of all the Philistine fortresses, its position on the sea constituting it then the key to S.W. Palestine. In ancient times little that is distinctive is recorded of it; though it may be reasonably inferred to have been already important for purposes of marine communication with the West.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">turn mine hand against</span>] <a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm" title="And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm" title="Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, said the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand on the little ones.">Zechariah 13:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/81-14.htm" title="I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.">Psalm 81:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ekron</span>] a fourth chief city of the Philistines, situated inland, about 12 miles N.E. of Ashdod, and nearer the territory of Judah than any of the cities before mentioned.

It is likewise a standing title with Ezekiel, who uses it with great frequency. It is employed sometimes by Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Deutero-Isaiah, as well as here and there by other prophets; and also occurs occasionally in the historical books (as <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-8.htm" title="And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?">Genesis 15:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-7.htm" title="And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, why have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelled on the other side Jordan!">Joshua 7:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Successes, of at least a temporary character, gained against the Philistines by Uzziah and Hezekiah, are recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm" title="And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.">2 Chronicles 26:6</a> f. and <a href="/2_kings/18-8.htm" title="He smote the Philistines, even to Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.">2 Kings 18:8</a>; but the foes from whom they suffered more severely were the Assyrians. Gaza was attacked by Tiglath-pileser (c. b.c. 734); its king Hanno was compelled to take refuge in Egypt; much spoil was taken, and a heavy tribute imposed (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[116][117] p. 256). In 711, Azuri, king of Ashdod, refused his accustomed tribute: the result was the siege by the Assyrian ‘Tartan,’ or general-in-chief, alluded to in Isaiah 20, which ended in the reduction of the city and exile of its inhabitants. Ten years later, in 701, Ashkelon and Ekron joined the Phoenician cities and Judah, in revolting from Sennacherib, and were both punished by the Assyrian king[118]. It seems, however, that though the power of the Philistines must have been seriously crippled by these blows, it was by no means destroyed: the kings of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, and Ashdod are all named as tributary to Esarhaddon and Asshurbanipal (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[119][120] 356); oracles are uttered against the Philistines by several of the later prophets; their cities are mentioned as places of importance in the times of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm" title="But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,">Nehemiah 4:7</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:">Nehemiah 13:23</a> f.) and the Maccabees.

"Askelon differs from the other celebrated cities of the Philistines, being seated on the sea, while Ekron, Garb, Jamnia, Ashdod, and Gaza are in the interior. It never could have had a harbour of any considerable size, however.... The topography of the place is peculiar. An abrupt ridge begins near the shore, runs up eastward, bends round to the south, then to the west, and finally northwest to the sea again, forming an irregular amphitheatre. On the top of this ridge ran the wall, which was defended at its salient angles by strong towers. The specimens which still exist show that it was very high and thick, built, however, of small stones, and bound together by broken columns of granite and marble. This clearly proves that it is patchwork, and not Askelon's original rampart.... The position is one of the fairest along this part of the Mediterranean coast; and when the interior of the amphitheatre was adorned with splendid temples and palaces, ascending, rank above rank, from the shore to the summit, the appearance from the sea must have been very imposing. Now the whole area is planted over with orchards of the various kinds of fruit which flourish in this region" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' <span class="accented">Southern Palestine</span>, p. 171). In spite of its bad harbour, it carried on a lucrative foreign commerce, which was the chief cause of its power and importance (Ewald, 'Hist. of Israel,' 1:247, Eng. transl.). It was about fifty Roman miles from Jerusalem. In mediaeval times there were two cities of the name, one on the coast (<a href="/jeremiah/47-7.htm">Jeremiah 47:7</a>), the same as Herod's Ascalon, and one inland. In its palmiest days the former could never have had a real harbour ('Survey Memoirs,' 3, pp. 245, 246). <span class="cmt_word">Ekron</span>, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Akir</span>, was twelve miles northeast of Ashdod, and some nine from the coast. Ashdod was taken by Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), by the tartan, or commander-in-chief, of Sargon (<a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>), and by Psammetichus King of Egypt (so. 635), when it sustained a siege of twenty-nine years (Herod., 2:157). Sennacherib, in a cuneiform inscription, records how he treated the two other cities: "Zedekiah King of Ashkelon," he says, "who had not submitted himself to my yoke, himself, the gods of the house of his fathers, his wife, his sons, his daughters, and his brothers, the seed of the house of his fathers, I removed, and I sent him to Assyria. I set over the men of Ashkelon, Sarludari, the son of Rukipti, their former king, and I imposed upon him the payment of tribute, and the homage due to my majesty, and he became a vassal....  I marched against the city of Ekron, and put to death the priests and the chief men who had committed the sin (of rebellion), and I hung up their bodies on stakes all round the city. The citizens who had done wrong and wickedness I counted as a spoil" (Professor Sayce, 'Fresh Light from the Monuments,' pp. 120, 121). <span class="cmt_word">I will turn mine hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">will bring back my hand</span>; visit again with punishment, or repeat the blow (<a href="/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>; see note on Zechariah 13:7). <span class="cmt_word">The remnant.</span> All the Philistines who had as yet escaped destruction (comp. <a href="/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord thereupon replies in <a href="/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a> : "All their wickedness is at Gilgal; for there I took them into hatred: for the evil of their doings will I drive them out of my house, and not love them any more; all their princes are rebellions." How far all the wickedness of Ephraim was concentrated at Gilgal it is impossible to determine more precisely, since we have no historical accounts of the idolatrous worship practised there (see at <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>). That Gilgal was the scene of horrible human sacrifices, as Hitzig observes at <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>, cannot be proved from <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>. &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; is used here in an inchoative sense, viz., to conceive hatred. On account of their wickedness they should be expelled from the house, i.e., the congregation of Jehovah (see at <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>). The expression "I will drive them out of my house" (mibbe&#772;th&#305;&#772; 'a&#774;ga&#770;reshe&#772;m) may be explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>, where Sarah requests Abraham to drive (ga&#770;rash) Hagar her maid out of the house along with her son, that the son of the maid may not inherit with Isaac, and where God commands the patriarch to carry out Sarah's will. The expulsion of Israel from the house of the Lord is separation from the fellowship of the covenant nation and its blessings, and is really equivalent to loving it no longer. There is a play upon words in the last clause &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1505;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
