The Lord saith this, who doeth this, who can do it, who has determined to do it, the power of whose grace is engaged for doing it. Verses 13-15 may refer to the early times of Christianity, but will receive a more glorious fulfilment in the events which all the prophets more or less foretold, and may be understood of the happy state when the fulness both of the Jews and the Gentiles come into the church. Let us continue earnest in prayer for the fulfilment of these prophecies, in the peace, purity, and the beauty of the church. God marvellously preserves his elect amidst the most fearful confusions and miseries. When all seems desperate, he wonderfully revives his church, and blesses her with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus. And great shall be the glory of that period, in which not one good thing promised shall remain unfulfilled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they may possess - rather, "inherit<p>The remnant of Edom - The restoration was not to be for themselves alone. No gifts of God end in the immediate object of His bounty and love. They were restored, in order that they, the first objects of God's mercies, might win others to God; not Edom only, "but all nations, upon whom," God says, "My Name is called." Plainly then, it is no temporal subjugation, nor any earthly kingdom. The words, "upon whom the name is called," involve, in any case, belonging to, and being owned by, him whose name is called upon them. It is said of the wife bearing the name of the husband and becoming his, "let thy name be called upon us <a href="/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>. When Jacob especially adopts Ephraim and Manasseh as his he says, "let my name be named upon them, and the name of My fathers, Abraham and Isaac" <a href="/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>. In relation to God, the words are used of persons and of places especially appropriated to God; as the whole Jewish Church and people, His Temple <a href="/1_kings/8-43.htm">1 Kings 8:43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-10.htm">Jeremiah 7:10-11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-15.htm">Jeremiah 34:15</a>, His prophets <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>, the city of Jerusalem <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18-19</a> by virtue of the temple built there. Contrariwise, Isaiah pleads to God, that the pagan "were never called by Thy Name" <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>. This relation of being "called" by the "Name" of God, was not outward only, nor was it ineffective. Its characteristics were holiness imparted by God to man, and protection by God. Thus Moses, in his blessing on Israel if obedient, says, "The Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto Himself, as He hath sworn to thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in His ways; and all the people of the earth shall see that the Name of the Lord thy God is called upon thee, and they shall fear thee" <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-9.htm">Deuteronomy 28:9-10</a>. And Jeremiah says to God , "Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart, for Thy name was called upon me, O Lord God of Hosts."<p>Israel then, or the Jewish Church, was to inherit, or take into itself, not Edom only, but all nations, and that, by their belonging to God. Edom, as the brother of Israel and yet his implacable enemy, stands as a symbol of all who were alien from God, over against His people. He says, the "residue of Edom," because he had foretold the destruction which was first to come upon Edom; and Holy Scripture everywhere speaks of those who should be converted, as a "remnant" only. The Jews themselves are the keepers and witnesses of these words. Was it not foretold? It stands written. Is it not fulfilled? The whole world from this country to China, and from China round again to us, as far as it is Christian, and as, year by year, more are gathered into the fold of Christ, are the inheritance of those who were the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<p>James quoted these words in the Council of Jerusalem, to show how the words of the prophet were in harmony with what Peter had related, how "God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for His Name" <a href="/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>. He quotes the words as they stood in the version which was understood by the Gentiles who came from Antioch. In it the words are paraphrased, but the meaning remains the same. The Greek translators took away the metaphor, in order, probably, to make the meaning more intelligible to Greeks, and paraphrased the Hebrew words, imagining other words, as like as might be to the Hebrew. They render, "that the residue of men may seek, and all the nations upon whom My name is called." The force of the prophecy lies in these last words, that "the Name of God should be called upon all nations." James, then, quoted the words as they were familiar to his hearers, not correcting those which did not impair the meaning. The so doing, he shows us incidentally, that even imperfection of translation does not empty the fullness of God's word. The words, "shall seek the Lord," although not representing anything expressed here in the original, occur in the corresponding prophecy of Isaiah as to the root of Jesse, "In that day there shall be a root" (that is, a sucker from the root) "of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people, and to it shall the Gentiles seek" <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>. It may be, that James purposely uses the plural, "the words of the prophets," in order to include, together with the prophet Amos, other prophets who had foretold the same thing. The statements, that the Jewish Church should inherit the Gentiles, that the Name of God should be called upon the Gentiles, and that the Gentiles should seek the Lord, are parts of one whole; that they should be called, that they should obey the call, and, obeying, he enrolled in the one family of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. That they may possess &#8230; remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen&#8212;"Edom," the bitter foe, though the brother, of Israel; therefore to be punished (Am 1:11, 12), Israel shall be lord of the "remnant" of Edom left after the punishment of the latter. James quotes it, "That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles," &c. For "all the heathen" nations stand on the same footing as Edom: Edom is the representative of them all. The residue or remnant in both cases expresses those left after great antecedent calamities (Ro 9:27; Zec 14:16). Here the conversion of "all nations" (of which the earnest was given in James's time) is represented as only to be realized on the re-establishment of the theocracy under Messiah, the Heir of the throne of David (Am 9:11). The possession of the heathen nations by Israel is to be spiritual, the latter being the ministers to the former for their conversion to Messiah, King of the Jews; just as the first conversions of pagans were through the ministry of the apostles, who were Jews. Compare Isa 54:3, "thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles" (compare Isa 49:8; Ro 4:13). A remnant of Edom became Jews under John Hyrcanus, and the rest amalgamated with the Arabians, who became Christians subsequently.<p>which are called by my name&#8212;that is, who belong to Me, whom I claim as Mine (Ps 2:8); in the purposes of electing grace, God terms them already called by His name. Compare the title, "the children," applied by anticipation, Heb 2:14. Hence as an act of sovereign grace, fulfilling His promise, it is spoken of God. Proclaim His title as sovereign, "the Lord that doeth this" ("all these things," Ac 15:17, namely, all these and such like acts of sovereign love).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/amos/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That they; </span> literally and historically the Jews, or they of the two tribes, and with them such of the ten tribes as did unite to them, and returned to Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">May possess, </span> both the lands of Edom, and some of the posterity of Edom; these as servants, the other as their propriety.

The Targum understands, by the Heathen or people, all the people of the house of Israel; and Kimchi, Aben Ezra, and Ben Melech, think the words are to be inverted, thus, <p>"that all the people on whom my name is called, nay possess the remnant of Edom;'' <p>and the forager says, that all the Edomites shall be destroyed in the days of the Messiah, but Israel shall inherit their land; and Aben Ezra says, that if this prophecy is interpreted of the Messiah, the matter is clear; as it is in the sense we have given, and as the apostle explains it; See Gill on <a href="/acts/15-17.htm">Acts 15:17</a>.

The allusion is to the nations—the Philistines, Moab, Ammon, Aram of Zobah, Damascus, Edom, &c.—which, though they had been conquered by David (2 Samuel 8, &c.), had afterwards revolted: these, Amos promises, should again be incorporated in the restored empire of David.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the remnant of Edom</span>] No doubt Edom is named specially on account of the ancient rivalry subsisting between it and Israel; in the happy future which the prophet here anticipates, he pictures it as reduced to a mere remnant (cf. <a href="/amos/1-12.htm" title="But I will send a fire on Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.">Amos 1:12</a>; <a href="/context/obadiah/1-18.htm" title="And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it....">Obadiah 1:18-21</a>). This seems better than to suppose an allusion to recent defeats, whether the victory of Amaziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2 Kings 14:7</a>),—which, however, must have taken place some 30 years previously,—or the subjugation by Uzziah, which appears to be presupposed by <a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm" title="He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.">2 Kings 14:22</a> (cf. <a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm" title="At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelled there to this day.">2 Kings 16:6</a> R.V. <span class="ital">marg.</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">all the nations, over whom my name has been called</span>] viz. in token of conquest, or ownership. The reference is to the nations which, as just stated, had been conquered by David: in virtue of their subjugation by him, they had passed under the dominion of Jehovah. The sense of the expression, <span class="ital">over whom my name was called</span>, appears clearly from <a href="/2_samuel/12-28.htm" title="Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.">2 Samuel 12:28</a>, where Joab, while besieging Rabbah of the Ammonites, invites David to come and take it himself “lest <span class="ital">I</span> (emph.) take the city, and <span class="ital">my name be called over it</span>,” i.e. lest I get the credit of having captured it, and it be counted as my conquest. The phrase expresses thus the fact of <span class="ital">ownership</span>—whether acquired by actual conquest or otherwise (cf. <a href="/isaiah/4-1.htm" title="And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.">Isaiah 4:1</a>).

Not only are there many minor variations from the text of the LXX.; but in the most important part of the quotation, the rendering adopted implies a reading of the Hebrew text (<span class="greekheb">אָדָם למען יִדְרְשׁוּ שארית</span> “that the remnant of men may seek [the Lord],” for <span class="greekheb">למען יִירְשׁוּ את שארית אֱדֹם</span> “that they may inherit the remnant of Edom”), which cannot be right, and can hardly even express a thought implicit in Amos’ words, though it is no doubt one found in other prophets, viz. that the ultimate aim of Israel’s restoration is to exert upon the nations a spiritual influence, and bring them to the knowledge of the true God (cf. <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm" title="Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.">Isaiah 55:5</a>). <span class="greekheb">Τὸν Κύριον</span> (“the Lord”), to which nothing corresponds in the Heb., has been supplied, it will be observed, in order to provide the verb “seek” with an object. The text of the Vatican MS. of the LXX. (cod. B) is purer and more original than that of the Alexandrian MS. (cod. A): the quotation in the Acts agrees in several particulars with the latter against the former; and it is not improbable that the text of cod. A has been corrected on the basis of the quotation. In Psalms 14 (13) 3, the composite quotation of St Paul (<a href="/context/romans/3-13.htm" title="Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:...">Romans 3:13-18</a>) has found its way even into the text of Cod.

David had subdued the Edomites (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-16.htm">1 Kings 11:16</a>), and Amaziah had inflicted a great slaughter upon them (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>); but later they recovered their independence (<a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>, where "Edomites" should be read for "Syrians;" <a href="/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>), and were actively hostile against the Jews. It was on this account that they were emphatically denounced by Obadiah.

This is closer to the Hebrew; but the meaning is much the same, viz. all those who are dedicated to God and belong to him being by faith incorporated into the true Israel. (For the phrase, comp. <a href="/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>; and to illustrate the idea, refer to <a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/87-5.htm">Psalm 87:5, 6</a>.)

And Jehovah roars out of Zion, and He thunders out of Jerusalem; and heaven and earth quake: but Jehovah is a refuge to His people, and a stronghold to the sons of Israel. <a href="/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17</a>. And ye will perceive that I Jehovah am your God, dwelling upon Zion, my holy mountain: and Jerusalem will be a sanctuary, and strangers will not pass through it any more." On the forebodings of the judgment in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>, see at <a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>. Out of Zion, the place of His throne, will Jehovah cause His thunder-voice to sound, will roar like a lion which is rushing upon its prey (<a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>; <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>), so that heaven and earth tremble in consequence. But it is only to His enemies that He is terrible; to His people, the true Israel, He is a refuge and strong tower. From the fact that He only destroys His enemies, and protects His own people, the latter will learn that He is their God, and dwells upon Zion in His sanctuary, i.e., that He there completes His kingdom, that He purifies Jerusalem of all foes, all the ungodly through the medium of the judgment, and makes it a holy place which cannot be trodden any more by strangers, by Gentiles, or by the unclean of either Gentiles or Israelites (<a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>), but will be inhabited only by the righteous (<a href="/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>), who, as <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a> affirms, are written in the Lamb's book of life. For Zion or Jerusalem is of course not the Jerusalem of the earthly Palestine, but the sanctified and glorified city of the living God, in which the Lord will be eternally united with His redeemed, sanctified, and glorified church. We are forbidden to think of the earthly Jerusalem or the earthly Mount Zion, not only by the circumstance that the gathering of all the heathen nations takes place in the valley of Jehoshaphat, i.e., in a portion of the valley of the Kidron, which is a pure impossibility, but also by the description which follows of the glorification of Judah. </body></html>
