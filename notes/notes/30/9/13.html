See notes on <a href="/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>.

The Lord saith this, who doeth this, who can do it, who has determined to do it, the power of whose grace is engaged for doing it. Verses 13-15 may refer to the early times of Christianity, but will receive a more glorious fulfilment in the events which all the prophets more or less foretold, and may be understood of the happy state when the fulness both of the Jews and the Gentiles come into the church. Let us continue earnest in prayer for the fulfilment of these prophecies, in the peace, purity, and the beauty of the church. God marvellously preserves his elect amidst the most fearful confusions and miseries. When all seems desperate, he wonderfully revives his church, and blesses her with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus. And great shall be the glory of that period, in which not one good thing promised shall remain unfulfilled.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold the days are coming - The Day of the Lord is ever coming on: every act, good or bad, is drawing it on: everything which fills up the measure of iniquity or which "hastens the accomplishment of the number of the elect;" all time hastens it by. "The plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed." The image is taken from God's promise in the law; "Your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time" <a href="/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>; which is the order of agriculture. The harvest should be so copious that it should not be threshed out until the vintage: the vintage so large, that, instead of ending, as usual, in the middle of the 7th month, it should continue on to the seed-time in November. Amos appears purposely to have altered this. He describes what is wholly beyond nature, in order that it might the more appear that he was speaking of no mere gifts of nature, but, under natural emblems, of the abundance of gifts of grace. "The plowman," who breaks up the fallow ground, "shall overtake," or "throng, the reaper. The "plowman" might "throng," or "join on to the reaper," either following upon him, or being followed by him; either preparing the soil for the harvest which the reaper gathers in, or breaking it up anew for fresh harvest after the in-gathering.<p>But the vintage falls between the harvest and the seed-time. If then by the "plowmen thronging on the reaper," we understand that the harvest should, for its abundance, not be over before the fresh seed-time, then, since the vintage is much nearer to the seed-time than the harvest had been, the words, "he that treadeth out the grapes, him that soweth the seed," would only say the same less forcibly. In the other way, it is one continuous whole. So vast would be the soil to be cultivated, so beyond all the powers of the cultivator, and yet so rapid and unceasing the growth, that seed-time and harvest would be but one. So our Lord says, "Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest" <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>. "Four months" ordinarily intervened between seed-time and harvest. Among these Samaritans, seed-time and harvest were one.<p>They had not, like the Jews, had teachers from God; yet, as soon as our Lord taught them, they believed. But, as seed time and harvest should be one, so should the vintage be continuous with the following seed-time. "The treader of grapes," the last crowning act of the year of cultivation, should join on to "him that soweth" (literally, "draweth" forth, soweth broadcast, scattereth far and wide the) "seed." All this is beyond nature, and so, the more in harmony with what went before, the establishment of a kingdom of grace, in which "the pagan" should have "the Name of God called upon" them. He had foretold to them, how God would "send famine on the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord" <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>. Now, under the same image, he declares the repeal of that sentence. He foretells, not the fullness only of God's gifts, but their unbroken continuance.<p>Jerome: "All shall succeed one another, so that no day should be void of grain, wine, and gladness." And they shall not follow only on one another, but shall all go on together in one perpetual round of toil and fruitfulness. There shall be one unceasing inpouring of riches; no break in the heavenly husbandry; labor shall at once yield fruit; the harvest shall but encourage fresh labor. The end shall come swiftly on the beginning; the end shall not close the past only, but issue forth anew. Such is the character of the toils of the Gospel. All the works of grace go on in harmony together; each helps on the other; in one, the fallow-ground of the heart is broken up; in another, seed is sown, the beginning of a holy conversation; in another, is the full richness of the ripened fruit, in advanced holiness or the blood of martyrs. And so, also, of the ministers of Christ, some are adapted especially to one office, some to another; yet all together carry on His one work. All, too, patriarchs, prophets, Apostles, shall meet together in one; they who, before Christ's coming , "sowed the seed, the promises of the Blessed Seed to come," and they who "entered into their labors," not to displace, but to complete them; all shall rejoice together in that Seed which is Christ.<p>And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt - Amos takes the words of Joel, in order to identify their prophecies, yet strengthens the image. For instead of saying, "the hills shall flow with milk," he says, "they shall melt, dissolve themselves. Such shall be the abundance and super-abundance of blessing, that it shall be as though the hills dissolved themselves in the rich streams which they poured down. The mountains and hills may be symbols, in regard either to their height, or their natural barrenness or their difficulty of cultivation. In past times they were scenes of idolatry. In the time of the Gospel, all should be changed; all should be above nature. All should be obedient to God: all, full of the graces and gifts of God. What was exalted, like the Apostles should be exalted not for itself, but in order to pour out the streams of life-giving doctrine and truth, which would refresh and gladden the faithful. And the lesser heights, "the hills," should, in their degree, pour out the same streams. Everything, heretofore barren and unfruitful, should overflow with spiritual blessing. The mountains and hills of Judaea, with their terraced sides clad with the vine were a natural symbol fruitfulness to the Jews, but they themselves could not think that natural fruitfulness was meant under this imagery. It would have been a hyperbole as to things of nature; but what, in naturl things, is a hyperbole, is but a faint shadow of the joys and rich delights and glad fruitfulness of grace. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the days come&#8212;at the future restoration of the Jews to their own land.<p>ploughman shall overtake &#8230; reaper &#8230; treader of grapes him that soweth&#8212;fulfilling Le 26:5.

It is a lofty strain, and very elegantly expresseth the abundance of outward blessings promised to this people here spoken of. If any will object, It appears not that ever it was so.

The blessing is founded on the Mosaic promise (<a href="/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ploughman shall overtake the reaper.</span> Ploughing and harvest shall be continuous, without sensible interval. <span class="cmt_word">The treader of grapes him that soweth seed.</span> The vintage should be so abundant that it should last till sowing time. <span class="cmt_word">The mountains shall drop sweet wine.</span> This is from <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And all the hills shall melt.</span> As Joel says, "shall flow with milk," in this promised land "flowing with milk and honey."

For, as Corn. a Lapide quotes, "Bacchus amat colles" (Virg., 'Georg.,' 2:113). The hyperbolical expressions in the text are not to be taken literally; they depict in bright colours the blessings of the kingdom of Messiah. Material and temporal blessings are generally represented as closely connected with spiritual, and as figurative of them. Such predictions, understood literally, are common in the so called Sibylline Books; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> lib. 3:743, etc., where, among other prodigies, we have - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> One is reminded of the golden age depicted by Virgil in his fourth eclogue. Trochon cites Claudian, 'In Rufin.,' 1:381, etc. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"... nec vomere sulcus adunco<br />Findetur; subitis messor gaudebit aristis.<br />Rorabunt querceta favis; stagnantia passim<br />Vina fluent, oleique lacus."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Sun and moon have become black, and the stars have withdrawn their shining. <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>. And Jehovah roars out of Zion, and He thunders out of Jerusalem; and heaven and earth quake: but Jehovah is a refuge to His people, and a stronghold to the sons of Israel. <a href="/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17</a>. And ye will perceive that I Jehovah am your God, dwelling upon Zion, my holy mountain: and Jerusalem will be a sanctuary, and strangers will not pass through it any more." On the forebodings of the judgment in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>, see at <a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>. Out of Zion, the place of His throne, will Jehovah cause His thunder-voice to sound, will roar like a lion which is rushing upon its prey (<a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>; <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>), so that heaven and earth tremble in consequence. But it is only to His enemies that He is terrible; to His people, the true Israel, He is a refuge and strong tower. From the fact that He only destroys His enemies, and protects His own people, the latter will learn that He is their God, and dwells upon Zion in His sanctuary, i.e., that He there completes His kingdom, that He purifies Jerusalem of all foes, all the ungodly through the medium of the judgment, and makes it a holy place which cannot be trodden any more by strangers, by Gentiles, or by the unclean of either Gentiles or Israelites (<a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>), but will be inhabited only by the righteous (<a href="/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>), who, as <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a> affirms, are written in the Lamb's book of life. For Zion or Jerusalem is of course not the Jerusalem of the earthly Palestine, but the sanctified and glorified city of the living God, in which the Lord will be eternally united with His redeemed, sanctified, and glorified church. We are forbidden to think of the earthly Jerusalem or the earthly Mount Zion, not only by the circumstance that the gathering of all the heathen nations takes place in the valley of Jehoshaphat, i.e., in a portion of the valley of the Kidron, which is a pure impossibility, but also by the description which follows of the glorification of Judah. </body></html>
