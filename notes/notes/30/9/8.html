Wherever sinners flee from God's justice, it will overtake them. Those whom God brings to heaven by his grace, shall never be cast down; but those who seek to climb thither by vain confidence in themselves, will be cast down and filled with shame. That which makes escape impossible and ruin sure, is, that God will set his eyes upon them for evil, not for good. Wretched must those be on whom the Lord looks for evil, and not for good. The Lord would scatter the Jews, and visit them with calamities, as the corn is shaken in a sieve; but he would save some from among them. The astonishing preservation of the Jews as a distinct people, seems here foretold. If professors make themselves like the world, God will level them with the world.

His "Eyes" are "on the sinful kingdom," whatsoever or wheresoever it be, and so on Israel also: "and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth." In this case, the emphasis would be on the, "I will not "utterly" destroy." God would destroy sinful kingdoms, yet Israel, although sinful, He would not "utterly" destroy, but would leave a remnant, as He had so often promised. Yet perhaps, and more probably, the contrast is between "the kingdom" and "the house of Israel. The kingdom," being founded in sin, bound up inseparably with sin, God says, "I will destroy from off the face of the earth," and it ceased forever. Only, with the kingdom, He says, "I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob," to whom were the promises, and to whose seed, whosoever were the true Israel, those promises should be kept.

Compare the similar prediction of judgment in <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>. The call is addressed to all nations to equip themselves for battle, and march into the valley of Jehoshaphat to war against the people of God, but in reality to be judged by the Lord through His heavenly heroes, whom He sends down thither. <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>. "Proclaim ye this among the nations; sanctify a war, awaken the heroes, let all the men of war draw near and come up! <a href="/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>. Forge your coulters into swords, and your vine-sickles into spears: let the weak one say, A hero am I. Joe 3:11. Hasten and come, all ye nations round about, and assemble yourselves! Let thy heroes come down thither, O Jehovah! <a href="/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12</a>. The nations are to rise up, and come into the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there shall I sit to judge all the heathen round about." The summons to prepare for war (<a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>) is addressed, not to the worshippers of Jehovah or the Israelites scattered among the heathen (Cyr., Calv., Umbreit), but to the heathen nations, though not directly to the heroes and warriors among the heathen, but to heralds, who are to listen to the divine message, and convey it to the heathen nations. This change belongs to the poetical drapery of thought, that at a sign from the Lord the heathen nations are to assemble together for war against Israel. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; does not mean "to declare war" (Hitzig), but to consecrate a war, i.e., to prepare for war by sacrifices and religious rites of consecration (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8-9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>). &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;: waken up or arouse (not wake up) the heroes from their peaceful rest to battle. With &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; the address passes over from the second person to the third, which Hitzig accounts for on the ground that the words state what the heralds are to say to the nations or heroes; but the continuance of the imperative ko&#772;ttu&#772; in <a href="/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a> does not suit this. This transition is a very frequent one (cf. <a href="/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1</a>), and may be very simply explained from the lively nature of the description. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is here applied to the advance of hostile armies against a land or city. The nations are to summon up all their resources and all their strength for this war, because it will be a decisive one. They are to forge the tools of peaceful agriculture into weapons of war (compare <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>, where the Messianic times of peace are depicted as the turning of weapons of war into instruments of agriculture). Even the weak one is to rouse himself up to be a hero, "as is generally the case when a whole nation is seized with warlike enthusiasm" (Hitzig). This enthusiasm is expressed still further in the appeal in <a href="/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a> to assemble together as speedily as possible. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is related to &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to hasten; whereas no support can be found in the language to the meaning "assemble," adopted by the lxx, Targ., etc. The expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; by no means necessitates our taking these words as a summons or challenge on the part of Joel to the heathen, as Hitzig does; for this can be very well interpreted as a summons, with which the nations call one another to battle, as the following &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; requires; and the assumption of Hitzig, Ewald, and others, that this form is the imperative for &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;, cannot be sustained from <a href="/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/50-5.htm">Jeremiah 50:5</a>. It is not till <a href="/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a> that Joel steps in with a prayer addressed to the Lord, that He will send down His heavenly heroes to the place to which the heathen are flowing together. Hanchath an imper. hiph., with pathach instead of tzere, on account of the guttural, from na&#770;chath, to come down. The heroes of Jehovah are heavenly hosts, or angels, who execute His commands as gibbo&#772;re&#772; kho&#772;a&#774;ch (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>). This prayer is answered thus by Jehovah in <a href="/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12</a> : "Let the nations rise up, and come into the valley of Jehoshaphat, for there will He hold judgment upon them." &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; corresponds to &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>; and at the close, "all the heathen round about" is deliberately repeated. Still there is no antithesis in this to "all nations" in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>, as though here the judgment was simply to come upon the hostile nations in the neighbourhood of Judah, and not upon all the heathen universally (Hitzig). For even in <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a> &#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; are simply all the heathen who have attacked the people of Jehovah - that is to say, all the nations round about Israel. Only these are not merely the neighbouring nations to Judah, but all heathen nations who have come into contact with the kingdom of God, i.e., all the nations of the earth without exception, inasmuch as before the last judgment the gospel of the kingdom is to be preached in all the world for a testimony to all nations (<a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="/mark/13-10.htm">Mark 13:10</a>).<p>It is to the last decisive judgment, in which all the single judgments find their end, that the command of Jehovah to His strong heroes refers. <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>. "Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread, for the win-press is full, the vats overflow: for their wickedness is great." The judgment is represented under the double figure of the reaping of the fields and the treading out of the grapes in the wine-press. The angels are first of all summoned to reap the ripe corn (<a href="/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-16.htm">Revelation 14:16</a>), and then commanded to tread the wine-presses that are filled with grapes. The opposite opinion expressed by Hitzig, viz., that the command to tread the wine-presses is preceded by the command to cut off the grapes, is supported partly by the erroneous assertion, that ba&#770;shal is not applied to the ripening of corn, and partly upon the arbitrary assumption that qa&#770;ts&#305;&#772;r, a harvest, stands for ba&#770;ts&#305;&#772;r, a vintage; and magga&#770;l, a sickle (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-16.htm">Jeremiah 50:16</a>), for mazme&#772;ra&#770;h, a vine-dresser's bill. But ba&#770;shal does not mean "to boil," either primarily or literally, but to be done, or to be ripe, like the Greek &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;, to ripen, to make soft, to boil (see at <a href="/exodus/12-9.htm">Exodus 12:9</a>), and hence in the piel both to boil and roast, and in the hiphil to make ripe of ripen (<a href="/genesis/40-10.htm">Genesis 40:10</a>), applied both to grapes and corn. It is impossible to infer from the fact that Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>) uses the word qa&#770;ts&#305;&#772;r for the vintage, on account of the alliteration with qayits, that this is also the meaning of the word in Joel. But we have a decisive proof in the resumption of this passage in <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>, where the two figures (of the corn-harvest and the gathering of the grapes) are kept quite distinct, and the clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; is paraphrased and explained thus: "The time is come for thee to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe." The ripeness of the corn is a figurative representation of ripeness for judgment. Just as in the harvest - namely, at the threshing and winnowing connected with the harvest - the grains of corn are separated from the husk, the wheat being gathered into the barns, the husk blown away by the wind, and the straw burned; so will the good be separated from the wicked by the judgment, the former being gathered into the kingdom of God for the enjoyment of eternal life, - the latter, on the other hand, being given up to eternal death. The harvest field is the earth (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;, <a href="/revelation/14-16.htm">Revelation 14:16</a>), i.e., the inhabitants of the earth, the human race. The ripening began at the time of the appearance of Christ upon the earth (<a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-38.htm">Matthew 9:38</a>). With the preaching of the gospel among all nations, the judgment of separation and decision (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18-21</a>) commenced; with the spread of the kingdom of Christ in the earth it passes over all nations; and it will be completed in the last judgment, on the return of Christ in glory at the end of this world. Joel does not carry out the figure of the harvest any further, but simply presents the judgment under the similar figure of the treading of the grapes that have been gathered. &#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, not from ya&#770;rad, to descend, but from ra&#770;da&#770;h, to trample under foot, tread the press that is filled with grapes. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1497;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is used in <a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a> to denote the most abundant harvest; here it is figuratively employed to denote the great mass of men who are ripe for the judgment, as the explanatory clause, for "their wicked (deed) is much," or "their wickedness is great," which recals <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, clearly shows. The treading of the wine-press does not express the idea of wading in blood, or the execution of a great massacre; but in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, as well as in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>, it is a figure denoting an annihilating judgment upon the enemies of God and of His kingdom. The wine-press is "the wine-press of the wrath of God," i.e., "what the wine-press is to ordinary grapes, the wrath of God is to the grapes referred to here" (Hengstenberg on <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19</a>).<p>The execution of this divine command is not expressly mentioned, but in <a href="/joel/3-14.htm">Joel 3:14</a>. the judgment is simply depicted thus: first of all we have a description of the streaming of the nations into the valley of judgment, and then of the appearance of Jehovah upon Zion in the terrible glory of the Judge of the world, and as the refuge of His people. <a href="/joel/3-14.htm">Joel 3:14</a>. "Tumult, tumult in the valley of decision: for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision." Ha&#774;mo&#772;n&#305;&#772;m are noisy crowds, whom the prophet sees in the Spirit pouring into the valley of Jehoshaphat. The repetition of the word is expressive of the great multitude, as in <a href="/2_kings/3-16.htm">2 Kings 3:16</a>. &#1506;&#1502;&#1511; &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; not valley of threshing; for though cha&#770;ru&#772;ts is used in <a href="/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> for the threshing-sledge, it is not used for the threshing itself, but valley of the deciding judgment, from cha&#770;rats, to decide, to determine irrevocably (<a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-40.htm">1 Kings 20:40</a>), so that cha&#770;ru&#772;ts simply defines the name Jehoshaphat with greater precision. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; (compare <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>) is used here to denote the immediate proximity of the judgment, which bursts at once, according to <a href="/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>. </body></html>
