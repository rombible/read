Amos was a simple, hardy shepherd from the southern wilds of Judah, and his prophecies are redolent of his early life, both in their homely imagery and in the wholesome indignation and contempt for the silken-robed vice of Israel. No sterner picture of an utterly rotten social state was ever drawn than this book gives of the luxury, licentiousness, and oppressiveness of the ruling classes. This passage deals rather with the religious declension underlying the moral filth, and sets forth the self-willed idolatry of the people {<a href="/amos/4-4.htm" title="Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:">Amos 4:4</a> - <a href="/amos/4-5.htm" title="And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this likes you, O you children of Israel, said the Lord GOD.">Amos 4:5</a>}, their obstinate resistance to God’s merciful chastisement {<a href="/amos/4-6.htm" title="And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:6</a> - <a href="/amos/4-11.htm" title="I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:11</a>}, and the heavier impending judgment {<a href="/amos/4-12.htm" title="Therefore thus will I do to you, O Israel: and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.">Amos 4:12</a> - <a href="/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Indignant irony flashes in that permission or command to persevere in the calf worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The seeming command is the strongest prohibition. There can be no worse thing befall a man than that he should be left to go on forwardly in the way of his heart. The real meaning is sufficiently emphasised by that second verb, ‘and <span class="ital">transgress</span>’. ‘Flock to one temple after another, and heap altars with sacrifices which you were never bid to offer, but understand that what you do is not worship, but sin.’ That is a smiting sentence to pass upon elaborate ceremonial. The word literally means treason or rebellion, and by it Amos at one blow shatters the whole fabric. Note, too, that the offering of tithes was not called for by Mosaic law, ‘every three days’ {Revised Version}, and that the use of leaven in burnt offerings was prohibited by it, and also that to call for freewill offerings was to turn spontaneousness into something like compulsion, and to bring ostentation into worship. All these characteristics spoiled the apparent religiousness, over and above the initial evil of disobedience, and warrant Amos’s crushing equation, ‘Your worship = rebellion.’ All are driven home by the last words of <a href="/amos/4-5.htm" title="And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this likes you, O you children of Israel, said the Lord GOD.">Amos 4:5</a>, ‘So ye love it.’ The reason for all this prodigal ostentatious worship was to please themselves, not to obey God. That tainted everything, and always does.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The lessons of this burst of sarcasm are plain. The subtle influence of self creeps in even in worship, and makes it hollow, unreal, and powerless to bless the worshipper. Obedience is better than costly gifts. The beginning and end of all worship, which is not at same time ‘transgression’ is the submission of tastes, will, and the whole self. Again, men will lavish gifts far more freely in apparent religious service, which is but the worship of their reflected selves, than in true service of God. Again, the purity of willing offerings is marred when they are given in response to a loud call, or, when given, are proclaimed with acclamations. Let us not suppose that all the brunt of Amos’s indignation fell only on these old devotees. The principles involved in it have a sharp edge, turned to a great deal which is allowed and fostered among ourselves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The blaze of indignation changes in the second part of the passage into wounded tenderness, as the Prophet speaks in the name of God, and recounts the dreary monotony of failure attending all God’s loving attempts to arrest Israel’s departure by the mercy of judgment.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Mark the sad cadence of the fivefold refrain, ‘Ye have not returned unto Me, saith the Lord.’ The ‘unto’ implies reaching the object to which we turn, and is not the less forcible but more usual word found in this phrase, which simply means ‘towards’ and indicates direction, without saying anything as to how far the return has gone. So there may have been partial moments of bethinking themselves, when the chastisement was on Israel; but there had been no thorough ‘turning,’ which had landed them at the side of God. Many a man turns <span class="ital">towards</span> God, who, for lack of resolved perseverance, never so turns as to get <span class="ital">to</span> God. The repeated complaint of the inefficacy of chastisements has in it a tone of sorrow and of wonder which does not belong only to the Prophet. If we remember who it was who was ‘grieved at the blindness of their heart,’ and who ‘wondered at their unbelief’ we shall not fear to recognise here the attribution of the same emotions to the heart of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To Amos, famine, drought, blasting, locusts, pestilence, and probably earthquake, were five messengers of God, and Amos was taught by God. If we looked deeper, we should see more clearly. The true view of the relation of all material things and events to God is this which the herdsman of Tekoa proclaimed. These messengers were not ‘miracles,’ but they were God’s messengers all the same. Behind all phenomena stands a personal will, and they are nearer the secret of the universe who see God working in it all, than they who see all forces except the One which is the only true force. ‘I give cleanness of teeth. I have withholden the rain. I have smitten. I have sent the pestilence. I have overthrown some of you.’ To the Prophet’s eye the world is all aflame with a present God. Let no scientific views, important and illuminating as these may be, hide from us the deeper truth, which lies beyond their region. The child who says ‘God,’ has got nearer the centre than the scientist who says ‘Force.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But Amos had another principle, that God sent physical calamities because of moral delinquencies and for moral and religious ends. These disasters were meant to bring Israel back to God, and were at once punishments and reformatory methods. No doubt the connection between sin and material evils was closer under the Old Testament than now. But if we may not argue as Amos did, in reference to such calamities as drought, and failures of harvests, and the like, as these affect communities, we may, at all events, affirm that, in the case of the individual, he is a wise man who regards all outward evil as having a possible bearing on his bettering spiritually. ‘If a drought comes, learn to look to your irrigation, and don’t cut down your forests so wantonly,’ say the wise men nowadays; ‘if pestilence breaks out, see to your drainage.’ By all means. These things, too, are God’s commandments, and we have no right to interpret the consequences of infraction of physical laws as being meant to punish nations for their breach of moral and religious ones. If we were prophets, we might, but not else. But still, is God so poor that He can have but one purpose in a providence? Every sorrow, of whatever sort, is meant to produce all the good effects which it naturally tends to produce; and since every experience of pain and loss and grief naturally tends to wean us from earth, and to drive us to find in God what earth can never yield, all our sorrows are His messengers to draw us back to Him. Amos’ lesson as to the purpose of trials is not antiquated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But he has still another to teach us; namely, the awful power which we have of resisting God’s efforts to draw us back. ‘Our wills are ours, we know not how,’ but alas! it is too often not ‘to make them Thine.’ This is the true tragedy of the world that God calls, and we do refuse, even as it is the deepest mystery of sinful manhood that God calls and we can refuse. What infinite pathos and grieved love, thrown back upon itself, is in that refrain, ‘Ye have not returned unto Me!’ How its recurrence speaks of the long-suffering which multiplied means as others failed, and of the divine charity, which ‘suffered long, was not soon angry, and hoped all things!’ How vividly it gives the impression of the obstinacy that to all effort opposed insensibility, and clung the more closely and insanely to the idolatry which was its crime and its ruin! The very same temper is deep in us all. Israel holds up the mirror in which we may see ourselves. If blows do not break iron, they harden it. A wasted sorrow-that is, a sorrow which does not drive us to God-leaves us less impressible than it found us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Again the mood changes, and the issue of protracted resistance is prophesied</span> {<a href="/amos/4-12.htm" title="Therefore thus will I do to you, O Israel: and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.">Amos 4:12</a> - <a href="/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a>}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Therefore’ sums up the instances of refusal to be warned, and presents them as the cause of the coming evil. The higher the dam is piled, the deeper the water that is gathered behind it, and the surer and more destructive the flood when it bursts. Long-delayed judgments are severe in proportion as they are slow. Note the awful vagueness of threatening in that emphatic ‘thus,’ as if the Prophet had the event before his eyes. There is no need to specify, for there can be but one result from such obstinacy. The ‘terror of the Lord’ is more moving by reason of the dimness which wraps it. The contact of divine power with human rebellion can only end in one way, and that is too terrible for speech. Conscience can translate ‘thus.’ The thunder-cloud is all the more dreadful for the vagueness of its outline, where its livid hues melt into formless black. What bolts lurk in its gloom?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The certainty of judgment is the basis of a call to repentance, which may avert it. The meeting with God for which Israel is besought to prepare, was, of course, not judgment after death, but the impending destruction of the Northern Kingdom. But Amos’s prophetic call is not misapplied when directed to that final day of the Lord. Common-sense teaches preparation for a certain future, and Amos’s trumpet-note is deepened and re-echoed by Jesus: ‘Be ye ready also, for . . . the Son of man cometh.’ Note, too, that Israel’s peculiar relation to God is the very ground of the certainty of its punishment, and of the appeal for repentance. Just because He is ‘thy God,’ will He assuredly come to judge, and you may assuredly prepare, by repentance, to meet Him. The conditions of meeting the Judge, and being ‘found of Him in peace,’ are that we should be ‘without spot, and blameless’; and the conditions of being so spotless and uncensurable are, what they were in Amos’s day, repentance and trust. Only we have Jesus as the brightness of the Father’s glory to trust in, and His all-sufficient work to trust to, for pardon and purifying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The magnificent proclamation of the name of the Lord which closes the passage, is meant as at once a guarantee of His judgment and an enforcement of the call to be ready to meet Him. He in creation forms the solid, changeless mountains and the viewless, passing wind. The most stable and the most mobile are His work. He reads men’s hearts, and can tell them their thoughts afar off. He is the Author of all changes, both in the physical and the moral world, bringing the daily wonder of sunrise and the nightly shroud of darkness, and with like alternation blending joy and sorrow in men’s lives. He treads ‘on the high places of the earth,’ making all created elevations the path of His feet, and crushing down whatever exalts itself. Thus, in creation almighty, in knowledge omniscient, in providence changing all things and Himself the same, subjugating all, and levelling a path for His purposes across every opposition, He manifests His name, as the living, eternal Jehovah, the God of the Covenant, and therefore of judgment on its breakers, and as the Commander and God of the embattled forces of the universe. Is this a God whose coming to judge is to be lightly dealt with? Is not this a God whom it is wise for us to be ready to meet?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/amos/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/amos/4-4.htm" title="Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:...">Amos 4:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Come to Beth-el — </span>The known place of the calf-worship; <span class="ital">and transgress — </span>A strong irony, giving them over as incorrigible: like that of <a href="/ezekiel/20-39.htm" title="As for you, O house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; Go you, serve you every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me: but pollute you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.">Ezekiel 20:39</a>, <span class="ital">Go ye, serve every man his idols.

But his irony is in bidding them go on to do, what they were doing earnestly, what they were set upon doing, and would not be withdrawn from. As Micaiah in irony, until adjured in the name of God, joined Ahab's court-priests, bidding, him "go to Ramoth-Gilead" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm">1 Kings 22:15</a>, where he was to perish; or Elijah said to the priests of Baal, "Cry aloud, for he is a god" <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>; or our Lord, "Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers" <a href="/matthew/23-32.htm">Matthew 23:32</a>; so Amos bids them do all they did, in their divided service of God, but tells them that to multiply all such service was to multiply transgression. Yet they were diligent in their way. Their offerings were daily, as at Jerusalem; the tithes of the third year for the poor was paid, as God had ordained <a href="/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>. They were punctual in these parts of the ritual, and thought much of their punctuality.<p>So well did they count themselves to stand with God, that there is no mention of sin offering or trespass offering. Their sacrifices were "sacrifics of thanksgiving" and "free will offerings," as if out of exuberance of devotion, such as David said that Zion would "offer," when God had been "favorable and gracious unto" her <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18-19</a>. These things they did; they "proclaimed" and "published" them, like the hypocrites whom our Lord reproves, "sounding a trumpet before them" <a href="/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a> when they did alms; proclaiming these private offerings, as God bade proclaim the solemn assemblies. "For so ye love." They did it, because they liked it, and it cost them nothing, for which they cared. It was more than most Christians will sacrifice, two fifteenths of their yearly income, if they gave the yearly tithes, which were to be shared with the poor also. But they would not sacrifice what God, above all, required, the fundamental breach of God's law, on which their kingdom rested, "the sin which Jeroboam made Israel to sin." They did what they liked; they were pleased with it, and they had that pleasure for their only reward, as it is of all which is not done for God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

Compare Le 25:20; Jud 17:10, and "the days" for the years, Joe 1:2. So a month of days is used for a full month, wanting no day to complete it (Ge 29:14, Margin; Nu 11:20, 21). The Israelites here also kept to the letter of the law in bringing in the tithes of their increase every third year (De 14:28; 26:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/amos/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Come to Beth-el, </span> the known place of the moscholatria, calf-worship: see <span class="bld"><a href="/amos/3-14.htm" title="That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel on him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.">Amos 3:14</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And transgress:</span> this clears it to be an irony, either throwing them up to their obstinate way of sinning, giving them over as hopeless and incorrigible sinners, or deriding their trust and dependence on idols, to which they sacrificed at Beth-el: See what will be the issue hereof, how you shall succeed herein. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At Gilgal multiply transgression; </span> Gilgal was a place also where much idolatry was acted: see <span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a> 9:15 12:11</span>.

Still the exaggeration thus implied would be somewhat extreme; and Wellhausen (who is followed by Nowack, <span class="ital">Heb. Arch.</span> ii. 258) adopts another rendering (which the Hebrew equally permits), viz. “<span class="ital">in the morning … on the third day</span>,” supposing it to have been the custom of the pilgrims to bring their sacrifices on the morning after their arrival at Beth-el, and to pay their tithes on the third day. The routine of sacrifice is punctiliously observed: but the moral and spiritual temper of which it should be the expression is absent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The custom of paying tithes was not peculiar to the Hebrews, but prevailed widely in antiquity: the Greeks, for instance, often rendered a tithe to the gods, on spoil taken in war, on the annual crops, on profits made by commerce, &c. By religious minds it was regarded as an expression of gratitude to the Deity, for the good things sent by Him to man; but it was often exacted as a fixed impost, payable, for instance, by the inhabitants of a particular district, for the maintenance of a priesthood or sanctuary. In the oldest Hebrew legislation, the “Book of the Covenant” (Exodus 21-23), no mention is made of tithes; but in the Deuteronomic legislation (7th cent. b.c.) the payment of tithes upon <span class="ital">vegetable</span> produce appears as an established custom, which the legislator partly presupposes, and partly regulates (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-6.htm" title="And thither you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks:">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-17.htm" title="You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/14-22.htm" title="You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year....">Deuteronomy 14:22-29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm" title="When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>). In Deut., in accordance with one of the fundamental aims of the book, payment at the central sanctuary (i.e. Jerusalem) is strongly insisted on: this passage shews that, at least in the Northern kingdom, it was customary to pay tithes at Beth-el. Probably, as Beth-el was an ancient sanctuary, this was a long-established practice there, the origin of which it seems to be the intention of <a href="/genesis/28-22.htm" title="And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.">Genesis 28:22</a> to attribute to the vow of the patriarch, Jacob. See further, on Hebrew tithe, and especially on the discrepancies between the Deuteronomic and the priestly legislation on the subject, the writer’s <span class="ital">Commentary on Deuteronomy</span>, pp. 168–173.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4–13</span>. Here the people at large are addressed by the prophet, perhaps at some festal religious gathering.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The prophet now turns to Israel, and ironically bids them exhibit their zeal for idolatry, and thus increase their guilt. <span class="cmt_word">Bethel</span>; as the chief seat of idol worship (<a href="/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At Gilgal;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to Gilgal</span>, "come ye" being repeated in thought. Gilgal was a strong position in the plain of Jordan, three miles east of Jericho, taking its name probably from the stone circles erected for purposes of worship in very early times. Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>) gave a new meaning to the old name. There is a large pool of water in this neighbourhood called Jil-julieh, about four miles from the Jordan, which is doubtless a corruption of the ancient name Gilgal. It seems to have been regarded as a holy place in Samuel's days or even before (see <a href="/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 13:8, etc.);   and later was appropriated to false worship, though we have no information as to the date of this declension. Gilgal and Bethel are associated together in idolatrous worship (<a href="/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> and in <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bring your sacrifices every morning.</span> They were careful to maintain the outward semblance of the regular Levitical worship, even beyond the letter of the Law in some respects, though their service was all the time idolatry. As this and the following clause are still ironical, Amos is speaking, not of the daily-prescribed sacrifice (<span class="accented">olah</span>, <a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>), but of the offerings (<span class="accented">zebach</span>) of individual Israelites which were not required to be presented every day. <span class="cmt_word">Your tithes after three years;</span> literally, <span class="accented">on the</span> <span class="accented">three of days</span>; <span class="accented">lishlosheth yamim</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">tribus diebus</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "every third day." Revised Version, "every three days." So Gesenius, Ewald, Keil, Schegg, Hitzig, Baur. The prophet bids them bring their tithes, not as the Law ordered, every year (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>), or, as in the case of the second tithe, every three years (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), but, by an ironical exaggeration, "every three days." Dr. Pusey defends the English Version on the ground of the idiomatic use of "days" for one circle of days, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a year (<a href="/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29</a>; <a href="/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7</a>). But this loses the irony which is so marked in the whole passage. Keil, "If ye would offer slain sacrifices every morning, and tithe every three days, ye would only thereby increase your apostasy from the living God." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This punishment Israel well deserved. <a href="/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>. "And Jacob fled to the fields of Aram; and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife did he keep guard. <a href="/hosea/12-13.htm">Hosea 12:13</a>. And through a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt, and through a prophet was he guarded. <a href="/hosea/12-14.htm">Hosea 12:14</a>. Ephraim has stirred up bitter wrath; and his Lord will leave his blood upon him, and turn back his shame upon him." In order to show the people still more impressively what great things the Lord had done for them, the prophet recals the flight of Jacob, the tribe-father, to Mesopotamia, and how he was obliged to serve many years there for a wife, and to guard cattle; whereas God had redeemed Israel out of the Egyptian bondage, and had faithfully guarded it through a prophet. The flight of Jacob to Aramaea, and his servitude there, are mentioned not "to give prominence to his zeal for the blessing of the birthright, and his obedience to the commandment of God and his parents" (Cyr., Theod., Th. v. Mops.); nor "to bring out the double servitude of Israel - the first the one which the people had to endure in their forefather, the second the one which they had to endure themselves in Egypt" (Umbreit); nor "to lay stress upon the manifestation of the divine care towards Jacob as well as towards the people of Israel" (Ewald); for there is nothing at all about this in <a href="/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>. The words point simply to the distress and affliction which Jacob had to endure, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>, as Calvin has correctly interpreted them. "Their father Jacob," he says, "who was he? what was his condition?... He was a fugitive from his country. Even if he had always lived at home, his father was only a stranger in the land. But he was compelled to flee into Syria. And how splendidly did he live there? He was with his uncle, no doubt, but he was treated quite as meanly as any common slave: he served for a wife. And how did he serve? He was the man who tended the cattle." Sha&#770;mar, the tending of cattle, was one of the hardest and lowest descriptions of servitude (cf. <a href="/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>). Sede&#772;h 'a&#774;ra&#770;m (the field of Aram) is no doubt simply the Hebrew rendering of the Aramaean Paddan-'a&#774;ra&#770;m (<a href="/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-18.htm">Genesis 31:18</a> : see at <a href="/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>). Jacob's flight to Aramaea, where he had to serve, is contrasted in sv. 10 with the leading of Israel, the people sprung from Jacob, out of Egypt by a prophet, i.e., by Moses (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>); and the guarding of cattle by Jacob is placed in contrast with the guarding of Israel on the part of God through the prophet Moses, when he led them through the wilderness to Canaan. The object of this is to call to the nation's remembrance that elevation from the lowest condition, which they were to acknowledge with humility every year, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>., when the first-fruits were presented before the Lord. For Ephraim had quite forgotten this. Instead of thanking the Lord for it by love and faithful devotedness to Him, it had provoked Him in the bitterest manner by its sins (&#1492;&#1499;&#1506;&#1497;&#1505;, to excite wrath, to provoke to anger: tamru&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, an adverbial accusative  equals  bitterly). For this should its blood-guiltiness remain upon it. According to <a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>., da&#770;m&#305;&#772;m denotes grave crimes that are punishable by death. Na&#770;tash, to let a thing alone, as in <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>; or to leave behind, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>. Leaving blood-guiltiness upon a person, is the opposite of taking away (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;) or forgiving the sin, and therefore inevitably brings the punishment after it. Cherpa&#770;tho&#772; (its reproach or dishonour) is the dishonour which Ephraim had done to the Lord by sin and idolatry (cf. <a href="/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a>). And this would be repaid to it by its Lord, i.e., by Jehovah. </body></html>
