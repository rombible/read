It would be better to adopt a slight emendation of our text, and treat the obscure word as a proper name (LXX., Targ., Syr., Vulg.). Many commentators (Michaelis, G.

In this ingenious, though somewhat far-fetched, interpretation of a difficult passage, it will be observed that Ewald takes the Hebrew verb as an active, and not a passive. In this he is supported by most MSS.<p>But the credit of suggesting the most plausible explanation belongs to Hitzig, who, in his commentary, proposes to read Hadad-Rimmon, and translates, <span class= "ital">Ye shall be cast away to Hadad-Rimmon.</span> On <a href="/zechariah/12-11.htm" title="In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.">Zechariah 12:11</a>, there is a long note by Steiner supporting the supposition that Hadad-Rimmon was a modified designation of the sun-god, and was likewise the counterpart of the Greek Adonis, over whose wounding and death there was an annual lamentation, in which the women took part, and gave way to all kinds of excess. Hadad-Rimmon was, therefore, the name of the deity and the locality of his worship (comp. <span class= "ital">Ashtaroth Karnaim</span> and other examples), now called <span class= "ital">Rummâne,</span> four miles south of <span class= "ital">Ledshûn</span> (Megiddo).

Help and hope have vanished, and they hurry pell-mell after one another, reckless and desperate, as the animals whose life of sense they had chosen.<p>And ye shall cast them into the palace - Or, better, (since nothing has been named which they could cast) "cast yourselves." The word may describe the headlong motion of the animal, and the desperate gestures of the hopeless. They should cast themselves from palace to palace, from the palace of their luxuries to the palace of their enemies, from a self-chosen life of sensuousness to he concubines in the harem. If the rulers are still included, it was reserved for the rich and noble to become eunuchs in the palace of their Assyrian or Babylonian conquerors, as Isaiah foretold to Hezekiah <a href="/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>. It is another instance of that great law of God, "wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same shall he be tormented" (Wisdom <a href="/isaiah/11-16.htm">Isaiah 11:16</a>). They had lived in luxury and wantonness; in luxury and wantonness they should live, but amid the jealousies of an Eastern harem, and at the caprice of their sensual conquerors.<p>The word however rendered, "to the palace," occurring only here, is obscure. The other most probable conjecture is, that it is a name of a country, "the mountains of Monah," that is, perhaps Armenia. This would describe accurately enough the country to which they were to be carried; "beyond Damascus; the cities of the Medes." The main sense is the same. They should be cast forth from the scene of their pleasures and oppression, to be themselves oppressed. The whole image is one, which an inspired prophet alone could use. The reproof was not from man, but from God, unveiling their sins to them in their true hideousness. Man thinks nothing of being more degraded than the brutes, so that he can hide from himself, that he is so. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. go out at the breaches&#8212;namely, of the city walls broken by the enemy.<p>every cow at that which is before her&#8212;figurative for the once luxurious nobles (compare "kine of Bashan," Am 4:1) shall go out each one right before her; not through the gates, but each at the breach before him, not turning to the right or left, apart from one another.<p>ye shall cast them into the palace&#8212;"them," that is, "your posterity," from Am 4:2. You yourselves shall escape through the breaches, after having cast your little children into the palace, so as not to see their destruction, and to escape the more quickly. Rather, "ye shall cast yourselves into the palace," so as to escape from it out of the city [Calvin]. The palace, the scene of the princes' riots (Am 3:10, 15; 4:1), is to be the scene of their ignominious flight. Compare in the similar case of Jerusalem's capture, the king's escape by way of the palace, through a breach in the wall (Eze 12:5, 12). Gesenius translates, "Ye shall be cast (as captives) into the (enemy's) stronghold"; in this view, the enemy's stronghold is called "palace," in retributive contrast to the "palaces" of Israel's nobles, the store houses of their robberies (Am 3:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/amos/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And ye, </span> kine of Bashan, oppressors distressed by the just hand of God, and by the violent hand of your enemy, shall go out, endeavour to make your escape by flight, at the breaches, which the besieging enemy made in your walls, when Samaria is besieged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every cow at that which is before her:</span> it shall be a universal flight, and with great consternation, they not able to forecast where the safest, but taking which way is readiest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye shall cast them into the palace; </span> either cast away all the riches and ornaments of your palaces, or the prey and bribes you had laid up there, or ye shall abandon the palaces ye dwelt in. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/amos/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ye shall go out at the breaches,....

Some render it, "ye shall cast yourselves"; so Abarbinel; that is, such as could not get out at the breaches should betake themselves to the palace or fort for their security. The Targum of the whole is, <p>"and they shall break down the wall upon you, and bring you out, gathered everyone before him, and carry you beyond the mountains of Armenia.'' <p>And so some others, taking it to be the name of a place, render it, "ye shall be cast into Armon", or Mona; which Bochart (r) suspects to be the same with Minni, mentioned with Ararat, a mountain in Armenia, <a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>. <p>(r) Geograph.

No place, however, named Harmon is known; nor is the word an appellative in Hebrew. Some of the ancients saw in ‘Harmonah’ an allusion to Armenia: thus the Targ. renders, ‘And they shall carry you into exile beyond the mountains of Harmini’; Pesh. ‘And they shall be cast to the mountain of Armenia’; Symm. ‘into Armenia’; cf.

The Hebrew expression <span class="accented">haharmonah</span> occurs nowhere else. Our version takes it in the sense of <span class="accented">armon</span>, "a palace," intending probably a palace or citadel of the enemy, which certainly ought to have been expressed. Kimchi renders, "Ye shall cast yourselves into the palace of the king." The passage is probably corrupt. If the verb is taken as passive, the unusual word must be considered to denote the place of banishment. Thus, "Ye shall be cast forth into Harmon." Whether Harmon means Armenia, as many ancient commentators thought, or not, cannot be determined. Various opinions may be seen in Keil, Schegg, Trochon, and others; but the simplest explanation is that of Orelli and Ewald, viz. that each fugitive shall fling away her idol Rimmona (the wife of the god Rimmon, <a href="/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>), in order to be more free for flight (comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This punishment Israel well deserved. <a href="/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>. "And Jacob fled to the fields of Aram; and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife did he keep guard. <a href="/hosea/12-13.htm">Hosea 12:13</a>. And through a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt, and through a prophet was he guarded. <a href="/hosea/12-14.htm">Hosea 12:14</a>. Ephraim has stirred up bitter wrath; and his Lord will leave his blood upon him, and turn back his shame upon him." In order to show the people still more impressively what great things the Lord had done for them, the prophet recals the flight of Jacob, the tribe-father, to Mesopotamia, and how he was obliged to serve many years there for a wife, and to guard cattle; whereas God had redeemed Israel out of the Egyptian bondage, and had faithfully guarded it through a prophet. The flight of Jacob to Aramaea, and his servitude there, are mentioned not "to give prominence to his zeal for the blessing of the birthright, and his obedience to the commandment of God and his parents" (Cyr., Theod., Th. v. Mops.); nor "to bring out the double servitude of Israel - the first the one which the people had to endure in their forefather, the second the one which they had to endure themselves in Egypt" (Umbreit); nor "to lay stress upon the manifestation of the divine care towards Jacob as well as towards the people of Israel" (Ewald); for there is nothing at all about this in <a href="/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>. The words point simply to the distress and affliction which Jacob had to endure, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>, as Calvin has correctly interpreted them. "Their father Jacob," he says, "who was he? what was his condition?... He was a fugitive from his country. Even if he had always lived at home, his father was only a stranger in the land. But he was compelled to flee into Syria. And how splendidly did he live there? He was with his uncle, no doubt, but he was treated quite as meanly as any common slave: he served for a wife. And how did he serve? He was the man who tended the cattle." Sha&#770;mar, the tending of cattle, was one of the hardest and lowest descriptions of servitude (cf. <a href="/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>). Sede&#772;h 'a&#774;ra&#770;m (the field of Aram) is no doubt simply the Hebrew rendering of the Aramaean Paddan-'a&#774;ra&#770;m (<a href="/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-18.htm">Genesis 31:18</a> : see at <a href="/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>). Jacob's flight to Aramaea, where he had to serve, is contrasted in sv. 10 with the leading of Israel, the people sprung from Jacob, out of Egypt by a prophet, i.e., by Moses (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>); and the guarding of cattle by Jacob is placed in contrast with the guarding of Israel on the part of God through the prophet Moses, when he led them through the wilderness to Canaan. The object of this is to call to the nation's remembrance that elevation from the lowest condition, which they were to acknowledge with humility every year, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>., when the first-fruits were presented before the Lord. For Ephraim had quite forgotten this. Instead of thanking the Lord for it by love and faithful devotedness to Him, it had provoked Him in the bitterest manner by its sins (&#1492;&#1499;&#1506;&#1497;&#1505;, to excite wrath, to provoke to anger: tamru&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, an adverbial accusative  equals  bitterly). For this should its blood-guiltiness remain upon it. According to <a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>., da&#770;m&#305;&#772;m denotes grave crimes that are punishable by death. Na&#770;tash, to let a thing alone, as in <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>; or to leave behind, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>. Leaving blood-guiltiness upon a person, is the opposite of taking away (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;) or forgiving the sin, and therefore inevitably brings the punishment after it. Cherpa&#770;tho&#772; (its reproach or dishonour) is the dishonour which Ephraim had done to the Lord by sin and idolatry (cf. <a href="/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a>). And this would be repaid to it by its Lord, i.e., by Jehovah. </body></html>
