He reminds them of their continual approach. He says not only that they will certainly come, but they are ever coming. They are holding on their steady course.

The image pictures (see <a href="/habakkuk/1-15.htm">Habakkuk 1:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4-5</a>,) their utter helplessness, the contempt in which they would be had, the ease with which they would be lifted out of the flood of pleasures in which they had immersed themselves.

That is, by himself, holiness being his nature, and an essential attribute of his; this is done to ascertain the truth of what is after said, and that men may be assured of the certain performance of it. Some render it, "by his holy place"; and interpret it of heaven; so Aben Ezra and Kimchi; which is not likely; see <a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a>. The Targum is, <p>"the Lord God hath sworn by his word in his holiness;'' <p>that, lo, the days shall come upon you; speedily, swiftly, and at an unawares: <p>that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fish hooks; the enemy, the king of Assyria, or God by him, would take them out of their own land, as fish out of water, out of their own element, and carry them captive into a strange land, both them and their posterity; and which should be as easily done as fish are taken with the hook, even though they were as the kine of Bashan. The word for fish hooks signifies "thorns" (p), and is by some so rendered; these perhaps being used in angling, before iron hooks were invented. The Targum is, <p>"that people shall take you away on their shields, and your daughters in fishermen's (q) boats;'' <p>see <a href="/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>. <p>(p) "spinis", Mercerus, Liveleus, Drusius, Grotius. (q) So it is interpreted by R. Sol Urbin Ohel Moed, fol. 65. 2. likewise Elias says the word signifies a small ship, or a boat that is in a large ship, Tishbi, p. 59.

I have spoken to the prophets; and I, I have multiplied visions, and spoken similitudes through the prophets. <a href="/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>. If Gilead (is) worthlessness, they have only come to nothing: in Gilgal they offered bullocks: even their altars are like stone-heaps in the furrows of the field." The Lord meets the delusion of the people, that they had become great and powerful through their own exertion, by reminding them that He (&#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; is adversative, yet I) has been Israel's God from Egypt hither, and that to Him they owe all prosperity and good in both past and present (cf. <a href="/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>). Because they do not recognise this, and because they put their trust in unrighteousness rather than in Him, He will now cause them to dwell in tents again, as in the days of the feast of Tabernacles, i.e., will repeat the leading through the wilderness. It is evident from the context that mo&#772;&#8219;e&#772;d (the feast) is here the feast of Tabernacles. &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; (the days of the feast) are the seven days of this festival, during which Israel was to dwell in booths, in remembrance of the fact that when God led them out of Egypt He had caused them to dwell in booths (tabernacles, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42-43</a>). &#1488;&#1491; &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1498; stands in antithesis to &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; ot si in <a href="/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>. "The preterite is changed into a future through the ingratitude of the nation" (Hengstenberg). The simile, "as in the days of the feast," shows that the repetition of the leading through the desert is not thought of here merely as a time of punishment, such as the prolongation of the sojourn of the Israelites in the wilderness for forty years really was (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>). For their dwelling in tents, or rather in booths (sukko&#772;th), on the feast of Tabernacles, was intended not so much to remind the people of the privations of their unsettled wandering life in the desert, as to call to their remembrance the shielding and sheltering care and protection of God in their wandering through the great and terrible wilderness (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42-43</a>). We must combine the two allusions, therefore: so that whilst the people are threatened indeed with being driven out of the good and glorious land, with its large and beautiful cities and houses full of all that is good (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10</a>.), into a dry and barren desert, they have also set before them the repetition of the divine guidance through the desert; so that they are not threatened with utter rejection on the part of God, but only with temporary banishment into the desert. In <a href="/hosea/12-10.htm">Hosea 12:10</a> and <a href="/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a> the two thoughts of <a href="/hosea/12-9.htm">Hosea 12:9</a> are still further expanded. In <a href="/hosea/12-10.htm">Hosea 12:10</a> they are reminded how the Lord had proved Himself to be the God of Israel from Egypt onwards, by sending prophets and multiplying prophecy, to make known His will and gracious counsel to the people, and to promote their salvation. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; with &#1506;&#1500;, to speak to, not because the word is something imposed upon a person, but because the inspiration of God came down to the prophets from above. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, not "I destroy," for it is only the kal that occurs in this sense, and not the piel, but "to compare," i.e., speak in similes; as, for example, in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1-11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1-5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a> etc.: "I have left no means of admonishing them untried" (Rosenmller). Israel, however, has not allowed itself to be admonished and warned, but has given itself up to sin and idolatry, the punishment of which cannot be delayed. Gilead and Gilgal represent the two halves of the kingdom of the ten tribes; Gilead the land to the east of the Jordan, and Gilgal the territory to the west. As Gilead is called "a city (i.e., a rendezvous) of evil-doers" (&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;) in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/6-8.htm">Hosea 6:8</a>, so is it here called distinctly &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, worthlessness, wickedness; and therefore it is to be utterly brought to nought. &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; are synonymous, denoting moral and physical nonentity (compare <a href="/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a>). Here the two notions are so distributed, that the former denotes the moral decay, the latter the physical. Worthlessness brings nothingness after it as a punishment. &#1488;&#1498;, only  equals  nothing, but equivalent to utterly. The perfect &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; is used for the certain future. Gilgal, which is mentioned in <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>, as the seat of one form of idolatrous worship, is spoken of here as a place of sacrifice, to indicate with a play upon the name the turning of the altars into heaps of stones (Gallim). The desolation or destruction of the altars involves not only the cessation of the idolatrous worship, but the dissolution of the kingdom and the banishment of the people out of the land. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which only occurs in the plural here, cannot of course be the dative (to sacrifice to oxen), but only the accusative. The sacrifice of oxen was reckoned as a sin on the part of the people, not on account of the animals offers, but on account of the unlawful place of sacrifice. The suffix to mizbecho&#772;tha&#770;m (their sacrifices) refers to Israel, the subject implied in zibbe&#772;chu&#772;. </body></html>
