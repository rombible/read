Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners.

God had twice promised, when the memory of the plagues which He sent on Egypt was still fresh "if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God - I will put none of the diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians" <a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-15.htm">Deuteronomy 7:15</a>. Contrariwise, God had forewarned them in that same prophecy of Moses, that, if they disobeyed Him, "He will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt which thou was afraid of, and they shall cleave unto thee" (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-60.htm">Deuteronomy 28:60</a>, add <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>). Egypt was, at times, subject to great visitations of the plague ; it is said to be its birthplace . Palestine was by nature healthy. Hence, and on account of the terribleness of the scourge, God so often speaks of it, as of His own special sending. He had threatened in the law; "I will sold a pestilence upon you" <a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>; "the Lord thy God will make the pestilence cleave unto you" <a href="/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21</a>. Jeremiah says to the false prophet Hananiah; "The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms, of war and of evil and of pestilence" <a href="/jeremiah/28-8.htm">Jeremiah 28:8</a>. Amos bears witness that those visitations came. Jeremiah Jer 14:12; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17-18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-17.htm">Jeremiah 34:17</a> and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>, etc.) prophesied them anew, together with the sword and with famine. Israel, having sinned like Egypt, was to be punished like Egypt.<p>And have taken away your horses - Literally, as English margin. "with the captivity of your horses." After famine, drought, locust, pestilence, followed that worst scourge of all, that through man. The possessions of the plain of Jezreel, so well suited for cavalry, probably induced israel to break in this respect the law of Moses. Hazael "left to Jehoahaz but 50 horsemen and 10 chariots and 10,000 footmen, for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing." Their armies, instead of being a defense, lay unburied on the ground, a fresh source of pestilence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. pestilence after the manner of Egypt&#8212;such as I formerly sent on the Egyptians (Ex 9:3, 8, &c.; Ex 12:29; De 28:27, 60).

A reference may here be made to the wars with the Syrians, wherein the Israelites suffered heavy losses (<a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3, 7, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And have taken away your horses;</span> rather, <span class="accented">together with your captive horses</span>, still under the regimen of "I have slain." The destruction of men and horses is mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The stink of your camps.</span> These unburied caresses caused pestilence in the district.

I knew thee in the desert, in the land of burning heats." As in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-10.htm">Hosea 12:10</a>, a contrast is drawn here again between the idolatry of the people and the uninterrupted self-attestation of Jehovah to the faithless nation. From Egypt hither Israel has known no other God than Jehovah, i.e., has found no other God to be a helper and Saviour. Even in the desert He knew Israel, i.e., adopted it in love. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, to know, when applied to God, is an attestation of His love and care (compare <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>, etc.).
