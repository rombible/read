Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two or three cities wandered into one city - Those then who were punished, were more than those who were reprieved. The word "wandered" literally, "trembled," expresses the unsteady reeling gate of those exhausted, in quest of food . They staggered through weakness, and uncertain, amid the general drought, whither to betake themselves. This was done, not in punishment but to heal. God paused, in order to give them opportunity to repent; in deed, His long-suffering only showed to themselves and to others, that they would not; "and ye returned not not Me; saith the Lord." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. three cities wandered&#8212;that is, the inhabitants of three cities (compare Jer 14:1-6).
