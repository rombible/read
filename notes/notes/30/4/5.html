In little or great, the calf-worship at Bethel, or the use of leaven in the sacrifice, they did as they willed. The prophet seems to have joined purposely the fundamental change, by which Jeroboam substituted the worship of nature for its God, and a minute alteration of the ritual, to show that one and the same temper, self-will, reigned in all, dictated all they did. The use of leaven in the things sacrificed was forbidden, out of a symbolic reason, that is, not in itself, but as representing something else. The Eastern leaven, like that used in France, consisting of what is sour, had the idea of decay and corruption connected with it. Hence, it was unfit to be offered to God. For whatever was the object of any sacrifice, whether of atonement or thanksgiving, perfection in its kind was essential to the idea of offering. Hence, it was expressly forbidden. "No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven, for ye shall burn no leaven in an offering of the Lord made by fire" (<a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>; add. <a href="/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17</a>). At other times it is expressly commanded, that "unleavened bread" should be used. In two cases only, in which the offering was not to be burned, were offerings to be made of leavened bread:<p>(1) the two loaves of first-fruits at Pentecost <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>, and<p>(2) an offering with which the thank offering was accompanied, and which was to be the priest's <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13-14</a>.<p>The special meat offering of the thank offering was to be without leaven <a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12</a>. To "offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven" was a direct infringement of God's appointment. It proceeded from the same frame of mind, as the breach of the greatest. Self-will was their only rule. What they willed, they kept; and what they willed, they brake. Amos bids them then go on, as they did in their willfulness, breaking God's commands of set purpose, and keeping them by accident.<p>Rup.: "This is a most grave mode of speaking, whereby He now saith, 'Come and do so and so, and He Himself who saith this, hateth those same deeds of theirs. He so speaketh, not as willing, but as abandoning not as inviting, but as expelling; not in exhortation but in indignation. He subjoins then, (as the case required,) 'for so ye loved.' As if He said, 'I therefore say, 'come to Bethel' where is your god, your calf, because 'so ye loved,' and hitherto ye have come. I therefore say, 'transgress,' because ye do transgress, and ye will to transgress. I say, 'come to Gilgal,' where were idols (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-19.htm">Judges 3:19</a>, English margin) long before Jeroboam's calves, because ye come and ye will to come. I say, 'multiply transgressions,' because ye do multiply it, and yet will to multiply it. I say, 'bring your sacrifices,' because ye offer them and ye will to offer them, to whom ye ought not. I say, 'offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven,' because ye so do, and ye will do it, leavened as ye are with 'the old leaven of malice and wickedness,' against the whole authority of the holy and spiritual law, which forbiddeth to offer in sacrifice anything leavened.<p>This pleaseth your gods, that ye be leavened, and without 'the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth' <a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>. To them then 'sacrifice the sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven,' because to Me ye, being sinners, cannot offer a seemly sacrifice of praise. And so doing, 'proclaim and publish the free offerings,' for so ye do, and so ye will to do, honoring the sacrifices which ye offer to your calves with the same names, whereby the authority of the law nameth those which are offered unto Me; 'burnt offerings,' and 'peace offerings;' and 'proclaim' them 'with the sound of trumpet and harp, with timbrel and dancing, with strings and organ, upon the well turned cymbals and the loud cymbals' <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/150-1.htm">Psalm 150:1-6</a>, that so ye may be thought to have sung louder and stronger than the tribe of Judah or the house of David in the temple of the Lord, because ye are more.' All these things are said, not with the intention of one willing, but with the indignation of one forsaking, as in many other instances. As that which the same Lord said to His betrayer; 'what thou doest, do quickly' <a href="/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a>. And in the Revelations we read, 'He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still' <a href="/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>. These things, and the rest of the like sort, are not the words of one commanding, or, of His own Will, conceding, but permitting and forsaking. 'For He was not ignorant, (Wisdom saith) (Wisdom <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>) that they were a naughty generation, and their malice was inbred, and that their cogitation never would be changed. '"<p>Proclaim and publish the free offerings - o: "Account much of what ye offer to God, and think that ye do great things, as though ye honored God condignly, and were under no obligation to offer such gifts. The whole is said in irony. For some there are, who appreciate magnificently the gifts and services which they offer to God, and think they have attained to great perfection, as though they made an adequate return to the divine benefits, not weighing the infinite dignity of the Divine Majesty, the incomparable greatness of the divine benefits, the frailty of their own condition and the imperfection of their service. Against whom is that which the Saviour saith, 'When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do' <a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>.

The frankincense was laid on the meat offering, and taken by the priest from it to burn on the altar (Le 2:1, 2, 8-11). Though unleavened cakes were to accompany the peace offering sacrifice of animals, leavened bread was also commanded (Le 7:12, 13), but not as a "meat offering" (Le 2:11).<p>this liketh you&#8212;that is, this is what ye like.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/amos/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven; </span> as all the rest of your will-worship, so this also is against the express law, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm" title="No meat offering, which you shall bring to the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for you shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:11</a></span>, but yet you will persist in it; and do so at your peril, try whether it end in good to you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Proclaim and publish the free-offerings; </span> publicly, frequently, and earnestly persuade your people to voluntary sacrifices, in which you think to please me; but you offer them all to idols; this your religion is impiety. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">This liketh you; </span> as you invented it, so it pleaseth you, and you will not be reclaimed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye children of Israel; </span> ye idolatrous, apostate Israelites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saith the Lord God; </span> for these you shall be punished by the Lord your God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/amos/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven,....

The words point simply to the distress and affliction which Jacob had to endure, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>, as Calvin has correctly interpreted them. "Their father Jacob," he says, "who was he? what was his condition?... He was a fugitive from his country. Even if he had always lived at home, his father was only a stranger in the land. But he was compelled to flee into Syria. And how splendidly did he live there? He was with his uncle, no doubt, but he was treated quite as meanly as any common slave: he served for a wife. And how did he serve? He was the man who tended the cattle." Sha&#770;mar, the tending of cattle, was one of the hardest and lowest descriptions of servitude (cf. <a href="/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>). Sede&#772;h 'a&#774;ra&#770;m (the field of Aram) is no doubt simply the Hebrew rendering of the Aramaean Paddan-'a&#774;ra&#770;m (<a href="/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-18.htm">Genesis 31:18</a> : see at <a href="/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>). Jacob's flight to Aramaea, where he had to serve, is contrasted in sv. 10 with the leading of Israel, the people sprung from Jacob, out of Egypt by a prophet, i.e., by Moses (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>); and the guarding of cattle by Jacob is placed in contrast with the guarding of Israel on the part of God through the prophet Moses, when he led them through the wilderness to Canaan. The object of this is to call to the nation's remembrance that elevation from the lowest condition, which they were to acknowledge with humility every year, according to <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>., when the first-fruits were presented before the Lord. For Ephraim had quite forgotten this. Instead of thanking the Lord for it by love and faithful devotedness to Him, it had provoked Him in the bitterest manner by its sins (&#1492;&#1499;&#1506;&#1497;&#1505;, to excite wrath, to provoke to anger: tamru&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, an adverbial accusative  equals  bitterly). For this should its blood-guiltiness remain upon it. According to <a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>., da&#770;m&#305;&#772;m denotes grave crimes that are punishable by death. Na&#770;tash, to let a thing alone, as in <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>; or to leave behind, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>. Leaving blood-guiltiness upon a person, is the opposite of taking away (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;) or forgiving the sin, and therefore inevitably brings the punishment after it. Cherpa&#770;tho&#772; (its reproach or dishonour) is the dishonour which Ephraim had done to the Lord by sin and idolatry (cf. <a href="/isaiah/65-7.htm">Isaiah 65:7</a>). And this would be repaid to it by its Lord, i.e., by Jehovah. </body></html>
