What is got and kept wrongfully, will not be kept long. Some are at ease, but there will come a day of visitation, and in that day, all they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall fail them. God will inquire into the sins of which they have been guilty in their houses, the robbery they have stored up, and the luxury in which they lived. The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do not fortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievous and vexatious. Yet a remnant, according to the election of grace, will be secured by our great and good Shepherd, as from the jaws of destruction, in the worst times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the day that I shall visit the transgression of Israel upon, him, I will also visit (upon) the altars of Bethel - Israel then hoped that its false worship of "nature" would avail it. God says, contrariwise, that when He should punish, all their false worship, so far from helping them, should itself be the manifest object of His displeasure. Again God attests, at once, His long-suffering and His final retribution. Still had He foreborne to punish, "being slow to anger and of great goodness;" but when that day, fixed by the divine Wisdom, should come, wherein He should vindicate His own holiness, by enduring the sin no longer, then He would "visit their transgressions," that is, all of them, old and new, forgotten by man or remembered, "upon them." Scripture speaks of "visiting offences upon" because, in God's Providence, the sin returns upon a man's own head. It is not only the cause of his being punished, but it becomes part of his punishment.<p>The memory of a man's sins will be part of his eternal suffering. Even in this life, "remorse," as distinct from repentance, is the "gnawing" of a man's own conscience for the folly of his sin. Then also God would visit upon the false worship. It is thought that God visits less speedily even grave sins against Himself, (so that man does not appeal falsely to Him and make Him, in a way, a partner of his offence,) than sins against His own creature, man. It may be that, All-Merciful as He is, He bears the rather with sins, involving corruption of the truth as to Himself, so long as they are done in ignorance, on account of the ignorant worship <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>; <a href="/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a> of Himself, or the fragments of truth which they contain, until the evil in them have its full sway in moral guilt <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>. Montanus: "Wonderful is the patience of God in enduring all those crimes and injuries which pertain directly to Himself; wonderful His waiting for repentance. But the deeds of guilt which violate human society, faith, and justice, hasten judgment and punishment, and, as it were, with a most effectual cry call upon the Divine Mind to punish, as it is written, "The voices of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground, And now cursed art thou, ..." <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10-11</a>.<p>If then upon that very grave guilt against God Himself there be accumulated these other sins, this so increases the load, that God casts it out. However long then Israel with impunity, given itself to that vain, alien worship, this evinced the patience, not the approval, of God. Now, when they are to be punished for the fourth transgresston, they will be punished for the first, second and third, and so, most grievously; when brought to punishment for their other sins, they should suffer for their other guilt of impiety and superstition."<p>And the horns of the altar - This was the one great "altar" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm">1 Kings 12:32-33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1-5</a> for burnt-offerings, set up by Jeroboam, in imitation of that of God at Jerusalem, whose doom was pronounccd in the act of its would-be consecration. He had copied faithfully outward form. At each corner, where the two sides met in one, rose the "horn," or pillar, a cubit high , there to sacrifice victims, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/118-27.htm">Psalm 118:27</a>, there to place the blood of atonement <a href="/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>. So far from atoning, they themselves were "the" unatoned "sin" of "Jeroboam whereby <a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21</a> he drove Israel from following the Lord, and made them sin a great sin. These were to be cut off; hewn down, with violence. A century and a half had passed, since the man of God had pronounced its sentence. They still stood. The day was not yet come; Josiah was still unborn; yet Amos, as peremptorily, renews the sentence. In rejecting these, whereon the atonement was made, God pronounced them out of covenant with Himself. Heresy makes itself as like as it can to the truth, but is thereby the more deceiving, not the less deadly. Amos mentions the altars of Bethel, as well as the altar. Jeroboam made but one altar, keeping as close as he could to the divine ritual. But false worship and heresy ever hold their course, developing themselves. They never stand still where they began, but spread, like a cancer <a href="/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17</a>. It is a test of heresy, like leprosy, that it spreads abroad <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a>, preying on what at first seemed sound. The oneness of the altar had relation to the Unity of God. In Samaria, they worshiped, they know not what <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>, not God, but some portion of His manifold operations. The many altars, forbidden as they were, were more in harmony with the religion of Jeroboam, even because they were against God's law. Heresy develops, becoming more consistent, by having less of truth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. That&#8212;rather, "since," or "for." This verse is not, as English Version translates, the thing which the witnesses cited are to "testify" (Am 3:13), but the reason why God calls on the heathen to witness Samaria's guilt; namely, in order to justify the punishment which He declares He will inflict.<p>I will also visit &#8230; Beth-el&#8212;the golden calves which were the source of all "the transgressions of Israel" (1Ki 12:32; 13:2; 2Ki 23:15, 16), though Israel thought that by them their transgressions were atoned for and God's favor secured.<p>horns of the altar&#8212;which used to be sprinkled with the blood of victims. They were horn-like projecting points at the corners of ancient altars. The singular, "altar," refers to the great altar erected by Jeroboam to the calves. The "altars," plural, refer to the lesser ones made in imitation of the great one (2Ch 34:5, compare with 1Ki 13:2; Ho 8:11; 10:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/amos/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the day; </span> in the appointed time, and within compass of a little time too; God will in his set time make quick work with them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Visit the transgressions of Israel upon him; </span> the many and great transgressions of the ten tribes, these God will, as he hath foretold by his prophets, severely punish, and in particular their idolatry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The altars, </span> erected unto the calves, and on which they Offered sacrifices to those idols by Jeroboam’s appointment at first, and by the continued commands of their idolatrous governors.

The three or four mentioned in the preceding chapter, the great multitude of them, their profaneness, uncleanness, and luxury, their injustice and oppression of the poor; when he should visit and punish for these sins, as he would by the hand of the Assyrian, he would not forget their idolatry; though no notice is taken of this before, in the appeal to the Heathen princes, who were likewise guilty of it: <p>I will also visit the altars of Bethel; where one of the calves Jeroboam made was set up and worshipped; and where was an altar erected, and sacrifice offered on it, <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>; and here the plural number is put for the singular; though it may be, that in process of time more altars might be set up as they increased in idolatry, and as seems from <a href="/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a>; and now the Lord would show his resentment at them, and punish those that worshipped and sacrificed there.

Israel is called Canaan here, not so much on account of its attachment to Canaanitish idolatry (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>), as according to the appellative meaning of the word Kena&#8219;an, which is borrowed from the commercial habits of the Canaanites (Phoenicians), viz., merchant or trader (<a href="/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>; <a href="/job/40-30.htm">Job 40:30</a>), because, like a fraudulent merchant, it strove to become great by oppression and cheating; not "because it acted towards God like a fraudulent merchant, offering Him false show for true reverence," as Schmieder supposes. For however thoroughly this may apply to the worship of the Israelites, it is not to this that the prophet refers, but to fraudulent weights, and the love of oppression or violence. And this points not to their attitude towards God, but to their conduct towards their fellow-men, which is the very opposite of what, according to the previous verse, the Lord requires (chesed u&#772;mishpa&#770;t), and the very thing which He has forbidden in the law, in <a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-13.htm">Deuteronomy 24:13-16</a>, and also in the case of &#8219;a&#770;shaq, violence, in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-2.htm">Leviticus 6:2-4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>. Ephraim prides itself upon this unrighteousness, in the idea that it has thereby acquired wealth and riches, and with the still greater self-deception, that with all its acquisition of property it has committed no wrong that was sin, i.e., that would be followed by punishment. &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; does not mean "might" here, but wealth, opes, although as a matter of fact, since Ephraim says this as a nation, the riches and power of the state are intended. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497; is not written at the head absolutely, in the sense of "so far as what I have acquired is concerned, men find no injustice in this;" for it that were the case, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497; would stand for &#1500;&#1497;; but it is really the subject, and &#1497;&#1510;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is to be taken in the sense of acquiring  equals  bringing in (cf. <a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>, etc.). </body></html>
