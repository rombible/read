Now, that soft, rounded, oblong, hill of Samaria, was one large luxurious couch, in which its rich and great rested securely, propped and cushioned up on both sides, in, what is still the place of dignity, "the corner of a bed," or "Divan," that is, the inner corner where the two sides meet. Damascus also, which Jeroboam had won for Israel, was a canopied couch to them, in which they stayed themselves. It is an image of listless ease and security, like that of these whom the false prophetesses lulled into careless stupidity as to their souls; "sewing pillows to all armholes," or "wrists" <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a>, whereon to lean in a dull inertness.<p>In vain! Of all those who then dwelt at ease and in luxury, the Good Shepherd Himself should rescue from "the lion," (the enemy, in the first instance the Assyrian,) a small remnant, in the sight of the enemy and of man of little account, but precious in the sight of God. The enemy would leave them perhaps, as not worth removing, just as, when the lion has devoured the fat and the strong, the shepherd may recover from him some slight piece of skin or extremity of the bones. Amos then, as well as Joel (see the note at <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>), preaches that same solemn sentence, so repeated throughout the prophets, "a reimnant" only "shall be saved." So doubtless it was in the captivity of the ten tribes, as in the rest. So it was in Judah, when certain "of the poor of the land" only were "left behind vinedessers and for farmers" <a href="/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-16.htm">Jeremiah 52:16</a>. In the Gospel, "not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty, not many noble were called" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>, but "God chose the poor of this world, rich in faith <a href="//biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>, and the Good Shepherd rescued from the mouth of the lion those whom man despised, yet who "had ears to hear."<p>After the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, a poor remnant only escaped. Rup.: "The spirit of prophecy foresaw both captivities, the end whereof was to confirm the faith, not in one place only but in all the earth, and so a slight remnant was "rescued from the mouth of the lion," that is, from the slaughter of the destroyers, and permitted to live, that through them, as a witness and monument, the justice of God might be known from age to age, and the truth of the Scriptures might be everywhere, borne about by them, still witnessing to Christ the Son of God, who is known by the law and the prophets. Hapness remnants, so "taken out" for the good of others, not their own!" As these remnants of the animal show what it was which the lion destroyed, yet are of no further profit, so are they now a memorial of what they once were, what grace through their sins they have lost.<p>Rib.: "Many souls will perish because they trust in their own strength, and no more call on God to have mercy on them than if they could rise of themselves and enter the way of salvation without God. They trust in the power of their friends, or the friendship of princes, or the doctrines of philophers, and repose in them as in a couch of Damascus. But Christ, the Good Shepherd, will rescue out of the mouth of "the lion," who "goeth about seeking, whom he may devour," what is last and of least esteem in this world, who have anything whereby the Good Shepherd can hold them. The "legs" signify the desire to go to hear the Word of God; the extremity of the ear, that obedience was not wholly lost. For if any begin even in part to obey the word of God which he hath heard, God, of His fatherly mercy, will help him and lead him on to perfect obedience. The legs also denote desire , whereby, as by certain steps, the soul approacheth to God or departeth from Him. Yet if a soul would be saved, desires suffice not; but if to these obedience to the heavenly commands be added, it shall be rescued from the mouth of the lion." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. shepherd&#8212;a pastoral image, appropriately used by Amos, a shepherd himself.<p>piece of &#8230; ear&#8212;brought by the shepherd to the owner of the sheep, so as not to have to pay for the loss (Ge 31:39; Ex 22:13). So if aught of Israel escapes, it shall be a miracle of God's goodness. It shall be but a scanty remnant. There is a kind of goat in the East the ears of which are a foot long, and proportionally broad. Perhaps the reference is to this. Compare on the image 1Sa 17:34, 35; 2Ti 4:17.<p>that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed&#8212;that is, that live luxuriously in Samaria (compare Am 6:1, 4). "A bed" means here the Oriental divan, a raised part of the room covered with cushions.<p>in Damascus in a couch&#8212;Jeroboam II had lately restored Damascus to Israel (2Ki 14:25, 28). So the Israelites are represented as not merely in "the corner of a bed," as in Samaria, but "in a (whole) couch," at Damascus, living in luxurious ease. Of these, now so luxurious, soon but a remnant shall be left by the foe. The destruction of Damascus and that of Samaria shall be conjoined; as here their luxurious lives, and subsequently under Pekah and Rezin their inroads on Judah, were combined (Isa 7:1-8; 8:4, 9; 17:3). The parallelism of "Samaria" to "Damascus," and the Septuagint favor English Version rather than Gesenius: "on a damask couch." The Hebrew pointing, though generally expressing damask, may express the city "Damascus"; and many manuscripts point it so.

The comparison, which is suggested no doubt by the experiences of Amos’ shepherd life, illustrates forcibly both the scant numbers and the shattered condition of the survivors, besides hinting at the formidable powers of the assailant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be taken out</span>] <span class="ital">be</span> <span class="bld">rescued.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that</span> <span class="bld">sit</span> <span class="ital">in Samaria in the corner of a</span> <span class="bld">divan</span>] The grandees of Samaria are represented as sitting luxuriously in the cushioned corners of their divans. In Assyria the king reclined, or sat up, on a couch beside the table, leaning his weight upon his left elbow, and having his right hand free and disposable (see the representation in Rawlinson’s <span class="ital">Anc. Monarchies</span>, ed. 4, i. 493). In the modern oriental houses of the wealthy (Van Lennep, <span class="ital">Bible Customs in Bible Lands</span>, p. 460, referred to by Mitchell), ‘a divan,’ or cushioned seat, about a yard in width, extends along three sides of the principal room, while a row of richly woven stuffed cushions lines the wall behind, and forms a support for the back: the seat of honour is the inmost corner of the divan, opposite the door. In some such luxurious state the magnates of Samaria sat in Amos’s day. The framework of the seat was often inlaid with ivory (<a href="/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and in Damascus</span> in <span class="ital">a couch</span>] The Hebrew text can hardly be right; nor, as pointed, is the Heb. word here found (<span class="ital">d’mésheḳ</span>) identical with that for Damascus (<span class="ital">damméseḳ</span>). Most moderns render <span class="ital">and on the damask</span> (whence R.V. <span class="ital">silken cushions</span>) <span class="ital">of a couch</span>. This rendering yields an excellent sense; but it cannot be regarded as certain: for (1) it is doubtful whether, in the time of Amos, Damascus was yet celebrated for the manufacture which in modern European languages is called after it: (2) in Arabic also, the name of the material (<span class="ital">dimaḳs</span>), which has been appealed to in support of this explanation, differs from that of the city (<span class="ital">Dimaḳsh</span>); hence it is very questionable whether it really derives its name from it. It is considered by Fränkel, <span class="ital">Aram. Fremdwörter im Arabischen</span>, p. 40, to be varied by metathesis from <span class="ital">midaḳs</span>, a form which also occurs, and which in its turn is derived from the Syr. <span class="ital">mîtaḳs</span>, which is the Greek <span class="greekheb">μέταξα</span>. Whatever uncertainty there may be about the word, it must, however, either be, or be the corrupt representative of, a term either synonymous or parallel with <span class="ital">corner</span>, in the preceding clause.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The prophet shows that the chastisement is inevitable, and that only the smallest remnant, the most worthless among the inhabitants, and they with much difficulty, can escape. The illustration from a common incident in a shepherd's life is very natural in Amos. <span class="cmt_word">Taketh</span>; better, <span class="accented">rescueth</span>. So below, <span class="cmt_word">shall be taken out;</span> <span class="accented">shall be rescued</span>. The usual explanation is that a shepherd attacks the lion which has seized one of his sheep (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a>, etc.), and rescues from it the most worthless parts - "a couple of shank bones or a bit, or tip, of an ear." But as an attack on a lion would be an abnormal act of courage on the part of a shepherd, and the comparison is with things likely and usual, it is probable that the meaning is that the shepherd finds only these poor remnants after the lion has left his prey. So such a poor remnant shall be rescued from the ten tribes of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">That dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed;</span> that sit at ease, lounging in the cosiest corner of the divan, an image of indolent ease and careless security in the face of impending judgment. <span class="cmt_word">And in Damascus in a couch;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">et in Damasci grabato</span>. The Syriac and Jewish Versions agree in considering the word "Damascus" to be a proper name. The other modern rendering takes it to mean the material which we call "damask," or something similar. Hence our Revised Version gives, "on the silken cushions of a bed;" and others, "on the damask of a couch." Dr. Pusey retains the old rendering, on the grounds that there is no evidence to prove that the manufactures for which Damascus was celebrated in after time existed at this period, its exports being then wine and white wool (<a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), and that the Arabic word <span class="accented">dimakso</span> (which critics have cited as connected with the term "damask") has nothing to do with Damascus, and meant raw, not manufactured, "silk." He translates, "in Damascus, a couch," and explains this to mean that Damascus, which Jeroboam II had won for Israel (<a href="/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>), "was a canopied couch to them, in which they stayed themselves." This agrees with the ancient Jewish interpretation, which explains the clause to mean that the Israelites would some day depend for help on the Syrians represented by Damascus A third exposition, favoured by the Latin Vulgate, makes the words to mean, "on a couch of Damascus;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Syrian couch of a costly and luxurious nature. This comes to the same as the modern rendering given, above and seems to be the easiest explanation of the expression. The difficulty depends chiefly on the punctuation of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5da;</span>; or them may be some corruption in the text. What the LXX. meant by their rendering is problematical,<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>, "The children of Israel who dwell in Samaria in the presence of the tribe and in Damascus." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To this God Israel is now to return. <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>.

The next two clauses, as the omission of the copula before chesed and the change in the tense clearly show, are to be taken as explanatory of &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;. The conversion is to show itself in the perception of love and right towards their brethren, and in constant trust in God. But Israel is far removed from this now.
