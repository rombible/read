They could not expect communion with God, unless they first sought peace with him. Where there is not friendship, there can be no fellowship. God and man cannot walk together, except they are agreed. Unless we seek his glory, we cannot walk with him. Let us not presume on outward privileges, without special, sanctifying grace. The threatenings of the word and providence of God against the sin of man are certain, and certainly show that the judgments of God are at hand. Nor will God remove the affliction he has sent, till it has done its work. The evil of sin is from ourselves, it is our own doing; but the evil of trouble is from God, and is his doing, whoever are the instruments. This should engage us patiently to bear public troubles, and to study to answer God's meaning in them. The whole of the passage shows that natural evil, or troubles, and not moral evil, or sin, is here meant. The warning given to a careless world will increase its condemnation another day.

When a bird trying to fly upwards is made to fall upon the earth snare, it is a plain proof that the snare is there; so, Israel, now that thou art falling, infer thence, that it is in the snare of the divine judgment that thou art entangled [Ludovicus De Dieu].<p>shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing&#8212;The bird-catcher does not remove his snare off the ground till he has caught some prey; so God will not withdraw the Assyrians, &c., the instruments of punishment, until they have had the success against you which God gives them. The foe corresponds to the "snare," suddenly springing from the ground and enclosing the bird on the latter touching it; the Hebrew is literally, "Shall the snare spring from the earth?"

No, there must be a snare set, or a bird can never be taken in it; and that is done, not by chance, but with the design of the fowler; yea, with the knowledge and will of God himself, <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>; the design of this is to show, that no judgment or affliction comes upon a people, or they into one, by chance, or without the appointment of God; they are his nets and snares, which he on purpose spreads and sets for persons, to take them in; and unless he did do so, they would not fall into any; see <a href="/job/5-6.htm">Job 5:6</a>; <p>shall one take up a snare from the earth; the Targum adds, out of its time: <p>and have taken nothing at all? when men set a snare to catch anything, do they take it up before anything is caught? they do not; they let it stand till something is ensnared in it, and so their end answered, and then they take it up, and not before. And thus when God denounces or brings a judgment, or an affliction, upon a people, does he remove it before the end is answered by it? he does not; if the end is to bring men to a sense of sin, and humiliation for it; or to bring near to God who have been wandering from him; or to try their graces, or take away their sin; when such an end is answered, then, and not till then, is the snare taken up, or the affliction removed; tilt such an end is brought about, the distress is continued, or the threatening of it; and of this Israel is hereby assured. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/amos/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{d}</span> Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin <i>is</i> for him? shall <i>one</i> take up a <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</span><p>(d) Can anything come without God's providence?<p>(e) Will his threatenings be in vain?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/amos/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="bld">Will</span> <span class="ital">a bird fall</span> <span class="bld">into</span> <span class="ital">a</span> <span class="bld">net</span> <span class="ital">upon the earth</span>, <span class="bld">when there is</span> <span class="ital">no</span> <span class="bld">bait</span> <span class="ital">for it?</span>] The <span class="ital">paḥ</span> must have been a kind of net; not improbably like the bird-traps figured in Wilkinson-Birch, <span class="ital">Ancient Egyptians</span>, ed. 1878, ii. 103, consisting of network strained over two semicircular flaps, moving on a common axis: this was laid upon the ground, and when the bait in the middle was touched by a bird, the two flaps, by a mechanical contrivance, flew up and closed, entrapping the bird.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gin</span>] <span class="bld">bait.</span> The <span class="ital">môḳçsh</span> (lit. a <span class="ital">fowling-instrument</span>) is shewn by the present passage to have been something connected with the <span class="ital">paḥ</span>, without which the latter was useless: elsewhere it often denotes metaphorically that which <span class="ital">allures</span> a person to destruction (e.g. <a href="/exodus/23-33.htm" title="They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me: for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-16.htm" title="And you shall consume all the people which the LORD your God shall deliver you; your eye shall have no pity on them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-21.htm" title="And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.

Tremble like birds out of Egypt, and like doves out of the land of Asshur: and I cause them to dwell in their houses, is the saying of Jehovah." When the Lord turns His pity towards the people once more, they will follow Him, and hasten, with trembling at His voice, from the lands of their banishment, and be reinstated by Him in their inheritance. The way for this promise was opened indeed by <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>, but here it is introduced quite abruptly, and without any logical particle of connection, like the same promise in <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>. &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497;, to walk after the Lord, denotes not only "obedience to the gathering voice of the Lord, as manifested by their drawing near" (Simson), but that walking in true obedience to the Lord which follows from conversion (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-8.htm">1 Kings 14:8</a>), so that the Chaldee has very properly rendered it, "They will follow the worship of Jehovah." This faithfulness they will exhibit first of all in practical obedience to the call of the Lord. This call is described as the roaring of a lion, the point of comparison lying simply in the fact that a lion announces its coming by roaring, so that the roaring merely indicates a loud, far-reaching call, like the blowing of the trumpet in <a href="/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>. The reason for what is affirmed is then given: "for He (Jehovah) will really utter His call," in consequence of which the Israelites, as His children, will come trembling (cha&#770;re&#772;d synonymous with pa&#770;chad, <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, from the sea, i.e., from the distant islands and lands of the west (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>), as well as from Egypt and Assyria, the lands of the south and east. These three regions are simply a special form of the idea, "out of all quarters of the globe;" compare the more complete enumeration of the several remote countries in <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>. The comparison to birds and doves expresses the swiftness with which they draw near, as doves fly to their dovecots (<a href="/isaiah/60-8.htm">Isaiah 60:8</a>). Then will the Lord cause them to dwell in their houses, i.e., settle them once more in their inheritance, in His own land (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>, where &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; is added). On the construing of &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; with &#1506;&#1500;, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-43.htm">1 Kings 20:43</a>, and the German auf der Stube sein. The expression &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1497;&#1497; affixes the seal of confirmation to this promise. The fulfilment takes place in the last says, when Israel as a nation shall enter the kingdom of God. Compare the remarks on this point at <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1-3</a>. </body></html>
