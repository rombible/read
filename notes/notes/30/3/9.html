The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do not fortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievous and vexatious.

Amos had already pronounced God's sentence on "the palaces of Ashdod" and all Philistia, for their sins against Himself in His people (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a>). Israel now, or a little later, courted Egypt <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>. To friend then and to foe, to those whom they dreaded and those whom they courted, God would lay open their sins. Contempt and contumely from an enemy aggravate suffering: man does not help whom he despiseth. "They were all ashamed of a people who could not profit them," saith Isaiah Isa 30:5 subsequently, of Egypt in regard to Judah. From those palaces, already doomed to destruction for their sins, the summons was to go, to visit Samaria, and see her sins, amid grace which those people had not. As our Lord says, "It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment, than for that city" <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>. Shame toward man survives shame toward God. What people are not ashamed to do, they are, apart from any consequences, ashamed to confess that they have done. Nay, to avoid a little passing shame, they rush upon "everlasting shame." So God employs all inferior motives, shame, fear, hope of things present, if by any means He can win people, not to offend Him.<p>Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria - that is, those surrounding it. Samaria was chosen with much human wisdom for the strong capital of a small people. Imbedded in mountains, and out of any of the usual routes , it lay, a mountain-fastness in a rich valley. Armies might surge to and fro in the valley of Jezreel, and be unconscious of its existence. The way from that great valley to Samaria lay, every way, through deep and often narrowing valleys , down which the armies of Samaria might readily pour, but which, like Thermopylae, might be held by a handful of men against a large host.<p>The broad vale near the hill of Dothan , along which the blinded Syrian army followed Elisha to Samaria, contracts into "a narrow valley" , before it reaches Samaria. The author of the book of Judith, who knew well the country, speaks of "the passages of the hill-country" near Dothaim, "by" which "there was an entrance into Judaea, and it was easy to stop them that would come up, because the passage was strait for two men at the most" . : "A series of long winding ravines open from the mountains to the plain; these were the passes so often defended by the 'horns of Joseph, the ten thousands of Ephraim, and the thousands of Manasseh' against the invaders from the north."<p>Within these lay  "the wide rocky rampart" which fenced in Samaria from the north . "The fine round swelling hill of Samaria, now cultivated to the top, (about 1,100 feet above the sea , and 300 from its own valley ,) stands alone in the midst of a great basin of some two hours (or 5 miles) in diameter surrounded by higher mountains on every side." : "The view from its summit presents a splendid panorama of the fertile basin and the mountains around, teeming with large villages, and includes not less than 25 degrees of the Mediterranean." Such a place, out of reach, in those days, from the neighboring heights, was well-near impregnable, except by famine. But its inhabitants must have had handed down to them the memory, how those heights had once been populated, while their valleys were thronged with "all the hosts" <a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24</a> of Benhadad, his chariots and his horsemen; and the mountains, in which they had trusted to shut out the enemy, were the prison-walls of their famished people.<p>From those heights , "the Syrians could plainly distinguish the famishing inhabitants of the city. The adjacent circle of hills were so densely occupied, that not a man could push through to bring provisions to the beleaguered city." The city, being built on the summit and terraced sides of the hill, unfenced and unconcealed by walls which, except at its base, were unneeded, lay open, unsheltered in every part from the gaze of the besiegers. The surrounding hills were one large amphitheater, from where to behold the tragedy of Israel , and enemies were invited to be the spectators. They could see its faminestricken inhabitants totter along those open terraces. Sin had brought this chastisement upon them. God had forgiven them then. When God who had, by His prophet, foretold their relief then <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1-2</a>, now by His prophet called anew those enemies of Samaria to those same heights to behold her sins, what could this mean but that He summoned them to avenge what He summoned them to behold?<p>It was no figure of speech. God avenges, as He comforts, not in word, but in deed. The triumph of those enemies David had especially deprecated, "Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumised triumph" <a href="/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>. To these Israel was to be a gazingstock. They were like "the woman set in the midst <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3</a>, amid one encircling sea of accusing insulting faces, with none to pity, none to intercede, none to show mercy to them who "had shewed no mercy." Faint image of the shame of that Day, when not people's deeds only, but "the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed" <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>, and "they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us" <a href="/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>; and of that "shame" there will be no end, for it is "everlasting" <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>.<p>And behold the great tumults - I. e, the alarms, restlessness, disorders and confusion of a people intent on gain; turning all law upside down, the tumultuous noise of the oppressors and oppressed. It is the word which Solomon uses , "Better is little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasure and tumult therewith," the tumults and restlessness of continual gaining. "And the oppressed," or better (as in the English margin) the oppressions , the manifold ever-repeated acts by which people were crushed and trampled on.<p>In the midst thereof - Admitted within her, domiciled, reigning there in her very center, and never departing out of her, as the Psalmist says, "Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deciet and guile depart not from her streets" <a href="/psalms/55-11.htm">Psalm 55:11</a>. Aforetime, God spared His people, that "His Name <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a> should not be polluted before the pagan, among whom they were, in whose sight I made Myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt." Now He summons those same pagan as witnesses that Israel was justly condemned. These sins, being sins against the moral law, the pagan would condemn. People condemn in others, what they do themselves. But so they would see that God hated sin, for which He spared not His own people, and could the less triumph over God, when they saw the people whom God had established and protected, given up to the king of Assyria. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Some, translating <span class="accented">al</span> "upon," say that the prophets are bidden publish their  message upon the flat roofs of the palaces, that it may be heard far and near (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>).

It was to the eternal disgrace of Israel that there were doings in her cities which the very heathen would condemn. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He held his brother's heel in the womb, and in his man's strength he fought with God. <a href="/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>. He fought against the angel, and overcame; wept, and prayed to Him: at Bethel he found Him, and there He talked with us. <a href="/hosea/12-5.htm">Hosea 12:5</a>. And Jehovah, God of hosts, Jehovah is His remembrance." The name Jacob, which refers to the patriarch himself in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-3.htm">Hosea 12:3</a>, forms the link between <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a> and <a href="/hosea/12-3.htm">Hosea 12:3</a>. The Israelites, as descendants of Jacob, were to strive to imitate the example of their forefather. His striving hard for the birthright, and his wrestling with God, in which he conquered by prayer and supplication, are types and pledges of salvation to the tribes of Israel which bear his name.<p>(Note: "He shows what good Jacob received, and the son is named in the father: he calls to remembrance the ancient history, that they may see both the mercy of God towards Jacob, and his resolute firmness towards the Lord." - Jerome.)<p>&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, a denom. from &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, "to hold the heel"  equals  &#1488;&#1495;&#1494; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>, which the prophet has in his mind, not "to overreach," as in <a href="/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a>. For the wrestling with God, mentioned in the second clause of the verse, proves most indisputably that Jacob's conduct is not held up before the people for a warning, as marked by cunning or deceit, as Umbreit and Hitzig suppose, but is set before them for their imitation, as an eager attempt to secure the birthright and the blessing connected with it. This shows at the same time, that the holding of the heel in the mother's womb is not quoted as a proof of the divine election of grace, and, in fact, that there is no reference at all to the circumstance, that "even when Jacob was still in his mother's womb, he did this not by his own strength, but by the mercy of God, who knows and loves those whom He has predestinated" (Jerome). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, is his manly strength (cf. <a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>) he wrestled with God (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-25.htm">Genesis 32:25-29</a>). This conflict (for the significance of which in relation to Jacob's spiritual life, see the discussion at Genesis l.c.) is more fully described in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>, for the Israelites to imitate. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; is the angel of Jehovah, the revealer of the invisible God (see the Commentary on the Pentateuch, pp. 118ff. transl.). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; is from <a href="/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>. The explanatory clause, "he wept, and made supplication to Him" (after <a href="/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a>), gives the nature of the conflict. It was a contest with the weapons of prayer; and with these he conquered. These weapons are also at the command of the Israelites, if they will only use them. The fruit of the victory was, that he (Jacob) found Him (God) at Bethel. This does not refer to the appearance of God to Jacob on his flight to Mesopotamia (<a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>), but to that recorded in <a href="/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>., when God confirmed his name of Israel, and renewed the promises of His blessing. And there, continues the prophet, He (God) spake with us; i.e., not there He speaks with us still, condemning by His prophets the idolatry at Bethel (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4-5</a>), as Kimchi supposes; but, as the imperfect &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; corresponds to &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "there did He speak to us through Jacob," i.e., what He there said to Jacob applies to us.<p>(Note: "Let it be carefully observed, that God is said to have talked at Bethel not with Jacob only, but with all his posterity. That is to say, the things which are here said to have been done by Jacob, and to have happened to him, had not regard to himself only, but to all the race that sprang from him, and were signs of the good fortune which they either would, or certainly might enjoy" (Lackemacher in Rosenmller's Scholia).)<p>The explanation of this is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-5.htm">Hosea 12:5</a>, where the name is recalled in which God revealed Himself to Moses, when He first called him (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>), i.e., in which He made known to him His true nature. Yeho&#772;va&#770;h zikhro&#772; is taken literally from &#1494;&#1492; &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;; but there the name Jehovah is still further defined by "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," here by "the God of hosts." This difference needs consideration. The Israelites in the time of Moses could only put full confidence in the divine call of Moses to be their deliverer out of the bondage of Egypt, on the ground that He who called him was the God who had manifested Himself to the patriarchs as the God of salvation; but for the Israelites of Hosea's time, the strength of their confidence in Jehovah arose from the fact that Jehovah was the God of hosts, i.e., the God who, because He commands the forces of heaven, both visible and invisible, rules with unrestricted omnipotence on earth as well as in heaven (see at <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>). </body></html>
