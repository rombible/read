It may be observed further on this verse, that there was no great revolution in the affairs, either of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, or in those of the neighbouring nations, which the prophets of God did not foretel; in order that the Jews might constantly be reminded of their God, either as a rewarder or punisher. <span class="ital">The lion hath roared, who will not fear? — </span>As when a lion roars, no one who hears can avoid fearing, so now, God having threatened, all who are made acquainted with the threatening ought to be alarmed and to stand in awe. <span class="ital">The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy? — </span>When God himself speaks, or commands, who will dare to do otherwise than obey? or, what prophet will have courage to refuse or forbear uttering what God reveals to him, and orders him to utter; for if the anger of a lion is to be feared, how much more the anger of God? <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/amos/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The distinguishing favours of God to us, if they do not restrain from sin, shall not exempt from punishment. They could not expect communion with God, unless they first sought peace with him. Where there is not friendship, there can be no fellowship. God and man cannot walk together, except they are agreed. Unless we seek his glory, we cannot walk with him. Let us not presume on outward privileges, without special, sanctifying grace. The threatenings of the word and providence of God against the sin of man are certain, and certainly show that the judgments of God are at hand. Nor will God remove the affliction he has sent, till it has done its work. The evil of sin is from ourselves, it is our own doing; but the evil of trouble is from God, and is his doing, whoever are the instruments. This should engage us patiently to bear public troubles, and to study to answer God's meaning in them. The whole of the passage shows that natural evil, or troubles, and not moral evil, or sin, is here meant. The warning given to a careless world will increase its condemnation another day.

And so now the Lord is about to reveal through Amos, His servant and prophet, what He willeth to do to the 10 tribes, that forsaking their idols and turning to Him, they might be freed from the impending peril; which is of the great mercy of God. He foretelleth evil to come, that He may not be compelled to inflict it.

"Ephraim has surrounded me with lying, and the house of Israel with deceit: and Judah is moreover unbridled against God, and against the faithful Holy One. <a href="/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a> (Heb.

And Jehovah has a controversy with Judah, and to perform a visitation upon Jacob, according to his ways: according to his works will He repay him." In the name of Jehovah, the prophet raises a charge against Israel once more. Lying and deceit are the terms which he applies, not so much to the idolatry which they preferred to the worship of Jehovah (&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, Theod.), as to the hypocrisy with which Israel, in spite of its idolatry, claimed to be still the people of Jehovah, pretended to worship Jehovah under the image of a calf, and turned right into wrong.<p>(Note: Calvin explains &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; correctly thus: "that He (i.e., God) had experienced the manifold faithlessness of the Israelites in all kinds of ways." He interprets the whole sentence as follows: "The Israelites had acted unfaithfully towards God, and resorted to deceits, and that not in one way only, or of only one kind; but just as a man might surround his enemy with a great army, so had they gathered together innumerable frauds, with which they attacked God on every side.")<p>Be&#772;th Yisra&#770;'e&#772;l (the house of Israel) is the nation of the ten tribes, and is synonymous with Ephraim. The statement concerning Judah has been interpreted in different ways, because the meaning of &#1512;&#1491; is open to dispute. Luther's rendering, "but Judah still holds fast to its God," is based upon the rabbinical interpretation of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, in the sense of &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;, to rule, which is decidedly false. According to the Arabic ra&#770;d, the meaning of ru&#772;d is to ramble about (used of cattle that have broken loose, or have not yet been fastened up, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>); hiphil, to cause to ramble about (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>). Construed as it is here with &#1506;&#1501;, it means to ramble about in relation to God, i.e., to be unbridled or unruly towards God. &#1506;&#1501;, as in many other cases where reciprocal actions are referred to, standing towards or with a person: see Ewald, 217, h. &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;, the faithful, holy God. Qedo&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m is used of God, as in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> (cf. <a href="/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19</a>), as an intensive pluralis majestatis, construed with a singular adjective (cf. <a href="/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>). &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;, firm, faithful, trustworthy; the opposite of ra&#770;d. Judah is unbridled towards the powerful God ('El), towards the Holy One, who, as the Faithful One, also proves Himself to be holy in relation to His people, both by the sanctification of those who embrace His salvation, and also by the judgment and destruction of those who obstinately resist the leadings of His grace. In <a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a> the lying and deceit of Israel are more fully described. &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is not to entertain one's self on wind, i.e., to take delight in vain things; but &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; means to eat or graze spiritually; and ru&#772;a&#774;ch, the wind, is equivalent to emptiness. The meaning therefore is, to strive eagerly after what is empty or vain; synonymous with ra&#770;daph, to pursue. &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, the east wind, in Palestine a fierce tempestuous wind, which comes with burning heat from the desert of Arabia, and is very destructive to seeds and plants (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>, and Wetzstein's Appendix to Delitzsch's Commentary on Job). It is used, therefore, as a figurative representation, not of vain hopes and ideals, that cannot possibly be reached, but of that destruction which Israel is bringing upon itself. "All the day," i.e., continually, it multiplies lying and violence, through the sins enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>, by which the kingdom is being internally broken up. Added to this, there is the seeking for alliances with the powers of the world, viz., Assyria and Egypt, by which it hopes to secure their help (<a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>), but only brings about its own destruction. Oil is taken to Egypt from the land abounding in olives (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>), not as tribute, but as a present, for the purpose of securing an ally in Egypt. This actually took place during the reign of Hoshea, who endeavoured to liberate himself from the oppression of Assyria by means of a treaty with Egypt (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>).<p>(Note: Manger has given the meaning correctly thus: "He is looking back to the ambassadors sent by king Hoshea with splendid presents to the king of Egypt, to bring him over to his side, and induce him to send him assistance against the king of Assyria, although he had bound himself by a sacred treaty to submit to the sovereignty of the latter." Compare also Hengstenberg's Christology, vol. i. p. 164 transl., where he refutes the current opinion, that the words refer to two different parties in the nation, viz., an Assyrian and an Egyptian party, and correctly describes the circumstances thus: "The people being severely oppressed by Asshur, sometimes apply to Egypt for help against Asshur, and at other times endeavour to awaken friendly feelings in the latter.")<p>The Lord will repay both kingdoms for such conduct as this. But just as the attitude of Judah towards God is described more mildly than the guilt of Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-12.htm">Hosea 11:12</a>, so the punishment of the two is differently described in <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>. Jehovah has a trial with Judah, i.e., He has to reprove and punish its sins and transgressions (<a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>). Upon Jacob, or Israel of the ten tribes (as in <a href="/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>), He has to perform a visitation, i.e., to punish it according to its ways and its deeds (cf. <a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>). &#1500;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;, it is to be visited, i.e., He must visit. </body></html>
