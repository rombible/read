Amos, born in the Southern Kingdom, and accustomed to the simple life of a shepherd, blazed up in indignation at the signs of misused wealth and selfish luxury that he saw everywhere, in what was to him almost a foreign country. If one fancies a godly Scottish Highlander sent to the West end of London, or a Bible-reading New England farmer’s man sent to New York’s ‘upper ten,’ one will have some notion of this prophet, the impressions made, and the task laid on him. He has a message to our state of society which, in many particulars, resembles that which he had to rebuke.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There seems to be a slight dislocation in the order of the verses of the passage, for <a href="/amos/5-7.htm" title="You who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,">Amos 5:7</a> comes in awkwardly, breaking the connection between <a href="/amos/5-6.htm" title="Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.">Amos 5:6</a> and <a href="/amos/5-8.htm" title="Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:">Amos 5:8</a>, and itself cut off from <a href="/amos/5-10.htm" title="They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.">Amos 5:10</a>, to which it belongs. If we remove the intruding verse to a position after <a href="/amos/5-9.htm" title="That strengthens the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.">Amos 5:9</a>, the whole passage is orderly and falls into three coherent parts: an exhortation to seek Jehovah, enforced by various considerations {<a href="/amos/5-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live:">Amos 5:4</a> - <a href="/amos/5-9.htm" title="That strengthens the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.">Amos 5:9</a>}; a vehement denunciation of social vices {<a href="/amos/5-7.htm" title="You who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,">Amos 5:7</a>, <a href="/amos/5-10.htm" title="They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.">Amos 5:10</a> - <a href="/amos/5-13.htm" title="Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.">Amos 5:13</a>}; and a renewed exhortation to seek God by doing right to man {<a href="/amos/5-14.htm" title="Seek good, and not evil, that you may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as you have spoken.">Amos 5:14</a> - <a href="/amos/5-15.htm" title="Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.">Amos 5:15</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Amos’s first call to Israel is but the echo of God’s to men, always and everywhere. All circumstances, all inward experiences, joy and sorrow, prosperity and disaster, our longings and our fears, they all cry aloud to us to seek His face. That loving invitation is ever sounding in our ears. And the promise which Amos gave, though it may have meant on his lips the continuance of national life only, yet had, even on his lips, a deeper meaning, which we now cannot but hear in it. For, just as to ‘seek the Lord’ means more to us than it did to Israel, so the consequent life has greatened, widened, deepened into life eternal. But Amos’s narrower, more external promise is true still, and there is no surer way of promoting true well-being than seeking God. ‘With Thee is the fountain of life,’ in all senses of the word, from the lowest purely physical to the highest, and it is only they who go thither to draw that will carry away their pitchers full of the sparkling blessing. The fundamental principle of Amos’s teaching is an eternal truth, that to seek God is to find Him, and to find Him is life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But Amos further teaches us that such seeking is not real nor able to find, unless it is accompanied with turning away from all sinful quests after vanities. We must give up seeking Bethel, Gilgal, or Beersheba, seats of the calf worship, if we are to seek God to purpose. The sin of the Northern Kingdom was that it wanted to worship Jehovah under the symbol of the calves, thus trying to unite two discrepant things. And is not a great deal of our Christianity of much the same quality? Too many of us are doing just what Elijah told the crowds on Carmel that they were doing, trying to ‘shuffle along on both knees.’ We would seek God, but we would like to have an occasional visit to Bethel. It cannot be done. There must be detachment, if there is to be any real attachment. And the certain transiency of all creatural objects is a good reason for not fastening ourselves to them, lest we should share their fate. ‘Gilgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought,’ therefore let us join ourselves to the Eternal Love and we shall abide, as it abides, for ever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The exhortation is next enforced by presenting the consequences of neglecting it. To seek Him is life, not to seek Him incurs the danger of finding Him in unwelcome ways. That is for ever true. We do not get away from God by forgetting Him, but we run the risk of finding in Him, not the fire which vitalises, purifies, melts, and gladdens, but that which consumes. The fire is one, but its effects are twofold. God is for us either that fire into which it is blessedness to be baptized, or that by which it is death to be burned up. And what can Bethel, or calves, or all the world do to quench it or pluck us out of it?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Once more the exhortation is urged, if we link <a href="/amos/5-8.htm" title="Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:">Amos 5:8</a> with <a href="/amos/5-6.htm" title="Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.">Amos 5:6</a>, and supply ‘Seek ye’ at its beginning. Here the enforcement is drawn from the considerations of God’s workings in nature and history. The shepherd from Tekoa had often gazed up at the silent splendours of the Pleiades and Orion, as he kept watch over his flocks by night, and had seen the thick darkness on the wide uplands thinning away as the morning stole op over the mountains across the Dead Sea, and the day dying as he gathered his sheep together. He had cowered under the torrential rains which swept across his exposed homeland, and had heard God’s voice summoning the obedient waters of the sea, that He might pour them down in rain. But the moral government of the world also calls on men to seek Jehovah. ‘He causeth destruction to flash forth on the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.’ High things attract the lightning. Godless strength is sure, sooner or later, to be smitten down, and no fortress is so impregnable that He cannot capture and overthrow it. Surely wisdom bids us seek Him that does all these wonders, and make Him our defence and our high tower.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second part gives a vivid picture of the vices characteristic of a prosperous state of society which is godless, and therefore selfishly luxurious. First, civil justice is corrupted, turned into bitterness, and prostrated to the ground. Then bold denouncers of national sins are violently hated. Do we not know that phase of an ungodly and rich society? What do the newspapers say about Christians who try to be social reformers? Are the epithets flung at them liker bouquets or rotten eggs? ‘Fanatics and faddists’ are the mildest of them. Then the poor are trodden down and have to give large parts of their scanty harvests to the rich. Have capital and labour just proportions of their joint earnings? Would a sermon on <a href="/amos/5-11.htm" title="For as much therefore as your treading is on the poor, and you take from him burdens of wheat: you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink wine of them.">Amos 5:11</a> be welcome in the suburbs of industrial centres, where the employers have their ‘houses of hewn stone’? Such houses, side by side with the poor men’s huts, struck the eye of the shepherd from Tekoa as the height of sinful luxury, and still more sinful disproportion in the social condition of the two classes. What would he have said if he had lived in England or America? Justice, too, was bought and sold. A murderer could buy himself off, while the poor man, who could not pay, lost his case. We do not bribe juries, but {legal} justice is an expensive luxury still, and counsel’s fees put it out of the reach of poor men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> One of the worst features of such a state of society as Amos saw is that men are afraid to speak out in condemnation of it, and the ill weeds grow apace for want of a scythe. Amos puts a certain sad emphasis on ‘prudent,’ as if he was feeling how little he could be called so, and yet there is a touch of scorn in him too. The man who is over-careful of his skin or his reputation will hold his tongue; even good men may become so accustomed to the glaring corruptions of society in the midst of which they have always lived, that they do not feel any call to rebuke or wage war against them; but the brave man, the man who takes his ideals from Christ, and judges society by its conformity with Christ’s standard, will not keep silence, and the more he feels that ‘It is an evil time’ the more will he feel that he cannot but speak out, whatever comes of his protest. What masquerades as prudence is very often sinful cowardice, and such silence is treason against Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The third part repeats the exhortation to ‘seek,’ with a notable difference. It is now ‘good’ that is to be sought, and ‘evil’ that is to be turned from. These correspond respectively to ‘Jehovah,’ and ‘Bethel, Gilgal, and Beersheba,’ in former verses. That is to say, morality is the garb of religion, and religion is the only true source of morality. If we are not seeking the things that are lovely and of good report, our professions of seeking God are false; and we shall never earnestly and successfully seek good and hate evil unless we have begun by seeking and finding God, and holding Him in our heart of hearts. Modern social reformers, who fancy that they can sweeten society without religion, might do worse than go to school to Amos.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Notable, too, is the lowered tone of confidence in the beneficial result of obeying the Prophet’s call. In the earlier exhortation the promise had been absolute. ‘Seek ye Me, and ye <span class="ital">shall</span> live’; now it has cooled to ‘it may be.’ Is Amos faltering? No; but while it is always true that blessed life is found by the seeker after God, because He finds the very source of life, it is not always true that the consequences of past turnings from Him are diverted by repentance. ‘It may be’ that these have to be endured, but even they become tokens of Jehovah’s graciousness, and the purified ‘remnant of Joseph’ will possess the true life more abundantly because they have been exercised thereby.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/amos/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/amos/5-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live:...">Amos 5:4-5</a>. </span><span class="ital">For — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">nevertheless, seek ye me, and ye shall live</span> — That is, ye shall be prosperous again; for life, in the Scripture language, is used to express prosperity, or happiness.

The Lord still proclaims mercy to men, but they often expect deliverance from such self-invented forms as make their condemnation sure. While they refuse to come to Christ and to seek mercy in and by him, that they may live, the fire of Divine wrath breaks forth upon them. Men may make an idol of the world, but will find it cannot protect.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seek ye Me and ye shall live - Literally, "seek Me; and live." Wonderful conciseness of the word of God, which, in two words, comprises the whole of the creature's duty and his hopes, his time and his eternity. The prophet users the two imperatives, inoneing both, man's duty and his reward. He does not speak of them, as cause and effect, but as one. Where the one is, there is the other. To seek God is to live. For to seek God is to find Him, and God is Life and the Source of life. Forgiveness, grace, life, enter the soul at once. But the seeking is diligent seeking. : "It is not to seek God anyhow, but as it is right and meet that He should be sought, longed for, prayed for, who is so great, a Good, constantly, fervently, yea, to our power, the more constantly and fervently, as an Infinite Good is more to be longed for, more loved than all created good." The object of the search is God Himself. "Seek Me," that is, seek God for Himself, not for anything out of Him, not for His gifts, not for anything to be loved with Him. This is not to seek Him purely. All is found in Him, but by seeking Him first, and then loving Him in all, and all in Him. "And ye shall live," first by the life of the body, escaping the enemy; then by the life of grace now, and the life of glory hereafter, as in that of the Psalmist, "your heart shall live who seek God" <a href="/psalms/69-32.htm">Psalm 69:32</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Seek ye me, and ye shall live&#8212;literally, "Seek &#8230; Me, and live." The second imperative expresses the certainty of "life" (escape from judgment) resulting from obedience to the precept in the first imperative.

"Seek me in the appointed way, and ye shall be saved from destruction" (comp. <a href="/genesis/42-18.htm">Genesis 42:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The guilt of Ephraim is bound together: his sin is preserved. <a href="/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>. The pains of a travailing woman come upon him: he is an unwise son; that he does not place himself at the time in the breaking forth of children." <a href="/hosea/13-12.htm">Hosea 13:12</a> is a special application of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-34.htm">Deuteronomy 32:34</a> to the ten tribes. Tsa&#770;ru&#772;r, bound up in a bundle, like a thing which you wish to take great care of (compare <a href="/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>). The same thing is applied in tsa&#770;phu&#772;n, hidden, carefully preserved, so as not to be lost (<a href="/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>). "All their sins are preserved for punishment" (Chald.). Therefore will pains overtake Ephraim like a woman in labour. The pains of childbirth are not merely a figurative representation of violent agony, but of the sufferings and calamities connected with the refining judgments of God, by which new life was to be born, and a complete transformation of all things effected (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9-10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>). He cannot be spared these pains, for he is a foolish son (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-28.htm">Deuteronomy 32:28</a>.). But in what respect? This is explained in the words &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "for at the time," or as &#1506;&#1514; cannot stand for &#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, more correctly "when it is time," he does not place himself in, i.e., does not enter, the opening of the womb. Mishbar ba&#770;n&#305;&#772;m is to be explained as in <a href="/2_kings/19-3.htm">2 Kings 19:3</a> and <a href="/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a>; and &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, c. &#1489; as in <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>. If the child does not come to the opening at the right time, the birth is retarded, and the life of both mother and child endangered. The mother and child are one person here. And this explains the transition from the pains of the mother to the behaviour of the child at the time of birth. Ephraim is an unwise son, inasmuch as even under the chastening judgment he still delays his conversion, and will not let himself be new-born, like a child, that at the time of the labour-pains will not enter the opening of the womb and so come to the birth. </body></html>
