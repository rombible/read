The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Woe unto you that desire - for yourselves.<p>The Day of the Lord - There were "mockers in those days" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a>; Jde 1:18, as there are now, and as there shall be in the last. And as the "scoffers in the last days" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a>; Jde 1:18 shall say, "Where is the promise of His coming?" so these said, "let Him make speed and hasten His work, that we way see it, and let the council of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it" <a href="/isaiah/5-19.htm">Isaiah 5:19</a>. Jeremiah complained; "they say unto me, where is the word of the Lord? let it come now!" <a href="/jeremiah/17-15.htm">Jeremiah 17:15</a>. And God says to Ezekiel, "Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, the days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? The vision that he seeth is for many days, and he prophesieth of the times far off" <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>. "They would shew their courage and strength of mind, by longing for the Day of the Lord, which the prophets foretold, in which God was to shew forth His power on the disobedient."<p>Lap.: "Let it come, what these prophets threaten until they are hoarse, let it come, let it come. It is ever held out to us, and never comes. We do not believe that it will come at all, or if it do come, it will not be so dreadful after all; it will go as it came." It may be, however, that they who scoffed at Amos, cloked their unbelief under the form of desiring the good days, which God had promised by Joel afterward. Jerome: "There is not," they would say, "so much of evil in the captivity, as there is of good in what the Lord has promised afterward." Amos meets the hypocrisy or the scoff, by the appeal to their consciences, "to what end is it to you?" They had nothing in common with it or with God. Whatever it had of good, was not for such as them. "The Day of the Lord is darkness, and not light." Like the pillar of the cloud between Israel and the Egyptians, which betokened God's presence, every day in which He shows forth His presence, is a day of light and darkness to those of different characters.<p>The prophets foretold both, but not to all. These scoffers either denied the Coming of that day altogether, or denied its terrors. Either way, they disbelieved God, and, disbelieving Him, would have no share in His promises. To them, the Day of the Lord would be unmixed darkness, distress, desolation, destruction, without one ray of gladness. The tempers of people, their belief or disbelief, are the same, as to the Great Day of the Lord, the Day of Judgment. It is all one, whether people deny it altogether or deny its terrors. In either case, they deny it, such as God has ordained it. The words of Amos condemn them too. "The Day of the Lord" had already become the name for every day of judgment, leading on to the Last Day. The principle of all God's judgments is one and the same. One and the same are the characters of those who are to be judged. In one and the same way, is each judgment looked forward to, neglected, prepared for, believed, disbelieved. In one and the same way, our Lord has taught us, will the Great Day come, as the judgments of the flood or upon Sodom, and will find people prepared or unprepared, as they were then. Words then, which describe the character of any day of Judgment, do, according to the Mind of God the Holy Spirit, describe all, and the last also. Of this too, and that chiefly, because it is the greatest, are the words spoken, "Woe unto you, who desire," amiss or rashly or scornfully or in misbelief, "the Day of the Lord, to what end is it for you? The Day of the Lord is darkness and not light."<p>Rup.: "This sounds a strange woe. It had not seemed strange, had he said, 'Woe to you, who fear not the Day of the Lord.' For, 'not to fear,' belongs to bad, ungodly people. But the good may desire it, so that the Apostle says, 'I desire to depart and to be with Christ' <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>. Yet even their desire is not without a sort of fear. For 'who can say, I have made my heart clean?' <a href="/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>. Yet that is the fear, not of slaves, but of sons; 'nor hath it torment,' <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>, for it hath 'strong consolation through hope' <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>; <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>. When then he says, 'Woe unto you that desire the Day of the Lord,' he rebuketh their boldness, 'who trust in themselves, that they are righteous' <a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9</a>." "At one and the same time," says Jerome, "the confidence of the proud is shaken off, who, in order to appear righteous before people, are accustomed to long for the Day of Judgment and to say, 'Would that the Lord would come, would that we might be dissolved and be with Christ,' imitating the Pharisee, who spake in the Gospel, "God, I thank Thee, that I am not as other men are" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11-12</a>.<p>For the very fact, that they "desire," and do not fear, "the Day of the Lord," shows, that they are worthy of punishment, since no man is without sin <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-36.htm">2 Chronicles 6:36</a>, and the "stars are not pure in His sight" <a href="/job/25-5.htm">Job 25:5</a>. And He "concluded all under sin, that he might have mercy upon all" <a href="/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a>; <a href="/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>. Since, then, no one can judge concerning the Judgment of God, and we are to "give account of every idle word" <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>, and Job "offered sacrifices" <a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a> daily for his sons, lest they should have thought something perversely against the Lord, what rashness it is, to long to reign alone! <a href="/1_corinthians/4-8.htm">1 Corinthians 4:8</a>. In troubles and distresses we are accustomed to say, 'would that we might depart out of the body and be freed from the miseries of this world,' not knowing that, while we are in this flesh, we have place for repentance; but if we depart, we shall hear that of the prophet, "in hell who will give Thee thanks?" <a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>. That is "the sorrow of this world" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>, which worketh "death," wherewith the Apostle would not have him sorrow who had sinned with his father's wife; the sorrow whereby the wretched Judas too perished, who, "swallowed up with overmuch sorrow" <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>, joined murder <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3-5</a> to his betrayal, a murder the worst of murders, so that where he thought to find a remedy, and that death by hanging was the end of ills, there he found the lion and the bear, and the serpent, under which names I think that different punishments are intended, or else the devil himself, who is rightly called a lion or bear or serpent." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

The expression is based probably upon the Hebrew use of <span class="ital">day</span> as equivalent to <span class="ital">day of battle</span> or <span class="ital">victory</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm" title="You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/9-4.htm" title="For you have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.">Isaiah 9:4</a>, the ‘day’ of Midian, i.e. the day of victory over Midian). From the present passage it appears to have been a current popular idea that Jehovah would one day manifest Himself, and confer some crowning victory upon His people: Amos points out that whether that will be so or not, depends upon Israel’s <span class="ital">moral</span> condition; the ‘day of Jehovah,’ such as the people imagine, would not be necessarily a day of victory to Israel over foreign powers, but a day in which Jehovah’s righteousness would be vindicated against <span class="ital">sin</span>, whether among foreign nations or His own people: so long therefore as Israel neglects to amend its ways, and continues to treat ritual as a substitute for morality, it will find Jehovah’s day to be the reverse of what it anticipates, a day not of triumph but of disaster. The ‘day of Jehovah,’ as thus understood by Amos, becomes a figure which is afterwards often employed by the prophets in their pictures of impending judgement. The conception places out of sight the human agents, by whom actually the judgement, as a rule, is effected, and regards the decisive movements of history as the exclusive manifestation of Jehovah’s purpose and power. The prophets, in adopting the figure, develope it under varying imagery, suggested partly by the occasion, partly by their own imagination. Thus Isaiah (<a href="/context/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:...">Isaiah 2:12-21</a>) represents it as directed against the various objects of pride and strength which Judah had accumulated in the days of Uzziah; Joel (<a href="/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a> ff.) derives his imagery from a recent visitation of locusts (as described in ch. 1): for other examples, see <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7</a>; <a href="/context/zephaniah/1-14.htm" title="The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hastens greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly....">Zephaniah 1:14-16</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/13-6.htm" title="Howl you; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty....">Isaiah 13:6-10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-8.htm" title="The mirth of tabrets ceases, the noise of them that rejoice ends, the joy of the harp ceases.">Isaiah 24:8</a>; <a href="/context/joel/3-14.htm" title="Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision....">Joel 3:14-16</a>.

"Hear this, ye old men; and attend, all ye inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing indeed happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers? <a href="/joel/1-1.htm">Joel 1:1</a>. Ye shall tell your sons of it, and your sons their sons, and their sons the next generation. <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>. The leavings of the gnawer the multiplier ate, and the leavings of the multiplier the licker ate, and the leavings of the licker the devourer ate." Not only for the purpose of calling the attention of the hearers to his address, but still more to set forth the event of which he is about to speak as something unheard of - a thing that has never happened before, and therefore is a judgment inflicted by God - the prophet commences with the question addressed to the old men, whose memory went the furthest back, and to all the inhabitants of Judah, whether they had ever experienced anything of the kind, or heard of such a thing from their fathers; and with the command to relate it to their children, and grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.<p>(Note: "As he is inquiring concerning the past according to the command of Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>, he asks the old men, who have been taught by long experience, and are accustomed, whenever they see anything unusual, to notice that this is not according to the ordinary course of nature, which they have observed for so many years. And since this existing calamity, caused by the insects named, has lasted longer and pressed more heavily than usual, he admonishes them to carry their memory back to the former days, and see whether anything of the kind ever happened naturally before; and if no example can be found, the prophet's advice is, that they should recognise this as the hand of God from heaven." - Tarnov.)<p>"The inhabitants of the land" are the inhabitants of Judah, as it was only with this kingdom that Joel was occupied (cf. <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a> and <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>). &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is the occurrence related in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>, which is represented by the question "Has this been in your days?" as a fact just experienced. Yether hagga&#770;za&#770;m, the leavings of the gnawer, i.e., whatever the gnawer leaves unconsumed of either vegetables or plants. The four names given to the locusts, viz., ga&#770;za&#770;m, 'arbeh, yeleq, and cha&#770;sil, are not the names applied in natural history to four distinct species, or four different generations of locusts; nor does Joel describe the swarms of two successive years, so that "ga&#770;za&#770;m is the migratory locust, which visits Palestine chiefly in the autumn, 'arbeh the young brood, yeleq the young locust in the last stage of its transformation, or before changing its skin for the fourth time, and cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l the perfect locust after this last change, so that as the brood sprang from the ga&#770;za&#770;m, cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l would be equivalent to ga&#770;za&#770;m" (Credner). This explanation is not only at variance with <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>, where ga&#770;za&#770;m stands last, after cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l, but is founded generally merely upon a false interpretation of <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-15.htm">Nahum 3:15-16</a> (see the passage) and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, where the adjective sa&#770;ma&#770;r (horridus, horrible), appended to yeleq, from sa&#770;ma&#770;r, to shudder, by no means refers to the rough, horny, wing-sheath of the young locusts, and cannot be sustained from the usage of the language, It is impossible to point out any difference in usage between ga&#770;za&#770;m and cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l, or between these two words and 'arbeh. The word ga&#770;za&#770;m, from ga&#770;za&#770;m, to cut off (in Arabic, Ethiopic, and the Rabb.), occurs only in this passage, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>, where it is applied to a swarm of flying locusts, which leave the vine, fig-tree, and olive, perfectly bare, as it is well known that all locusts do, when, as in Amos, the vegetables and field fruits have been already destroyed. 'Arbeh, from ra&#770;bha&#770;h, to be many, is the common name of the locust, and indeed in all probability of the migratory locust, because this always appears in innumerable swarms. Cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l, from cha&#770;sal, to eat off, designates the locust (ha&#770;'arbeh), according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>, by its habit of eating off the field crops and tree fruits, and is therefore used in <a href="/1_kings/8-37.htm">1 Kings 8:37</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-28.htm">2 Chronicles 6:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>, as synonymous with ha&#770;'arbeh, and in <a href="/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a> in its stead. Yeleq, from ya&#770;laq  equals  la&#770;qaq, to lick, to lick off, occurs in <a href="/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a> as equivalent to 'arbeh, and in Nahum as synonymous with it; and indeed it there refers expressly to the Egyptian plague of locusts, so that young locusts without wings cannot possibly be thought of. Hagga&#770;za&#770;m the gnawer, hayyeleq the licker, hecha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l the devourer, are therefore simply poetical epithets applied to the 'arbeh, which never occur in simple plain prose, but are confined to the loftier (rhetorical and poetical) style. Moreover, the assumption that Joel is speaking of swarms of locusts of two successive years, is neither required by <a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a> (see the comm. on this verse), nor reconcilable with the contents of the verse itself. If the 'arbeh eats what the ga&#770;za&#770;m has left, and the yeleq what is left by the 'arbeh, we cannot possibly think of the field and garden fruits of two successive years, because the fruits of the second year are not the leavings of the previous year, but have grown afresh in the year itself.<p>(Note: Bochart (Hieroz. iii. p. 290, ed. Ros.) has already expressed the same opinion. "If," he says, "the different species had been assigned to so many different years, the 'arbeh would not be said to have eaten the leavings of the ga&#770;za&#770;m, or the yeleq the leavings of the 'arbeh, or the cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l the leavings of the yeleq; for the productions of this year are not the leavings of last, nor can what will spring up in future be looked upon as the leavings of this. Therefore, whether this plague of locusts was confined to one year, or was repeated for several years, which seems to be the true inference from <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>, I do not think that the different species of locusts are to be assigned to different years respectively, but that they all entered Judaea in the same year; so that when one swarm departed from a field, another followed, to eat up the leavings of the previous swarm, if there were any; and that this was repeated as many times as was necessary to consume the whole, so that nothing at all should be left to feed either man or beast.")<p>The thought is rather this: one swarm of locusts after another has invaded the land, and completely devoured its fruit. The use of several different words, and the division of the locusts into four successive swarms, of which each devours what has been left by its precursor, belong to the rhetorical drapery and individualizing of the thought. The only thing that has any real significance is the number four, as the four kinds of punishment in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>, and the four destructive judgments in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>, clearly show. The number four, "the stamp of oecumenicity" (Kliefoth), indicates here the spread of the judgment over the whole of Judah in all directions. </body></html>
