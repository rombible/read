Evil times will not bear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evil men indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak to them. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to save the land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, to beseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seek him; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as for sinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shall pass through them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in all vineyards shall be wailing - All joy should be turned into sorrow. Where aforetime was the vintage-shout in thankfulness for the ingathering, and anticipating gladness to come, there, in the source of their luxury, should be wailing, the forerunner of sorrow to come. it was a vintage, not of wine, but of woe.<p>For I will pass through thee - In the destruction of the firstborn in Egypt, God did not "pass through" but "passed over" them, and they kept, in memory thereof the feast of the Passover. Now God would no longer "pass over" them and their sins. He says, "I will pass through thee," as He then said, "I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn of the land of Egypt - and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment" <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>. As God says by Hosea, "I will not enter the city" <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm">Hosea 11:9</a>, that is, He would not make His presence felt, or take cognizance, when to take cognizance would be to punish, so here, contrariwise, He says, "I will pass through," taking exact and severe account, in judgment. Jerome further says, "so often as this word is used in Holy Scripture, in the person of God, it denotes punishment, that He would not abide among them, but would pass through and leave them. Surely, it is an image of this, that, when the Jews would have cast our Lord headlong from the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, "He passed through the midst of them <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/4-30.htm">Luke 4:30</a>, so that they could not see Him nor know Him, "and so went His way." And this, when He had just told them, that none of the widows of Israel were fed by Elias, or the lepers cleansed by Elisha, save the widow of Sarepta, and Naaman the Syrian. So should their leprosy cleave to them, and the famine of the word of God and of the oil of the Holy Spirit abide among them, while the Gentiles were washed by His laver and fed with the bread of life." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. in all vineyards &#8230; wailing&#8212;where usually songs of joy were heard.<p>pass through thee&#8212;taking vengeance (Ex 12:12, 23; Na 1:12).

The pronoun &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; and the suffix to &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1501; refer to everything that the prophet has laid before the people in his book for warning, for reproof, for correction, for chastening in righteousness.

"The ways of Jehovah" (darkhe&#772; Yeho&#772;va&#770;h) are the ways taken by God in the guidance and government of men; not only the ways which He prescribes for them, but also His guidance of them.
