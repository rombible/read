Shiche&#772;th does not mean to act corruptly here, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-7.htm">Exodus 32:7</a>, but to bring into corruption, to ruin, as in <a href="/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/9-15.htm">Genesis 9:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-15.htm">Numbers 32:15</a>, etc. The sentence &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; cannot be explained in any other way than by supplying the pronoun &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, as a subject taken from the suffix to &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;&#1498; (Marck, and nearly all the modern commentators). "This throws thee into distress, that thou hast resisted me, who am thy help." &#1489;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1498;: as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, except that &#1489; is used in the sense of against, as in <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>, etc. This opposition did not take place, however, when all Israel demanded a king of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). For although this desire is represented there (<a href="/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7</a>) as the rejection of Jehovah, Hosea is speaking here simply of the Israel of the ten tribes. The latter rebelled against Jehovah, when they fell away from the house of David, and made Jeroboam their king, and with contempt of Jehovah put their trust in the might of their kings of their own choosing (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>.). But these kings could not afford them any true help. The question, "Where" ('eh&#305;&#772; only occurs here and twice in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>, for &#1488;&#1497; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1492;, possibly simply from a dialectical variation - vid. Ewald, 104, c - and is strengthened by &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488;, as in <a href="/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>), "Where is thy king, that he may help thee?" does not presuppose that Israel had no king at all at that time, and that the kingdom was in a state of anarchy, but simply that it had no king who could save it, when the foe, the Assyrian, attacked it in all its cities. Before sho&#772;pheteykha&#770; (thy judges) we must repeat 'e&#774;h&#305;&#772; (where). The sho&#772;phet&#305;&#772;m, as the use of the word sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m (princes) in its stead in the following clause clearly shows, are not simple judges, but royal counsellors and ministers, who managed the affairs of the kingdom along with the king, and superintended the administration of justice. The saying, "Give me a king and princes," reminds us very forcibly of the demand of the people in the time of Samuel; but they really refer simply to the desire of the ten tribes for a king of their own, which manifested itself in their dissatisfaction with the rule of the house of David, and their consequent secession, and to their persistence in this secession amidst all the subsequent changes of the government. We cannot therefore take the imperfects &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1488;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; in <a href="/hosea/13-11.htm">Hosea 13:11</a> as pure preterites, i.e., we cannot understand them as referring simply to the choice of Jeroboam as king, and to his death. The imperfects denote an action that is repeated again and again, for which we should use the present, and refer to all the kings that the kingdom of the ten tribes had received and was receiving still, and to their removal. God in His wrath gives the sinful nation kings and takes them away, in order to punish the nation through its kings. This applies not merely to the kings who followed one another so rapidly through conspiracy and murder, although through these the kingdom was gradually broken up and its dissolution accelerated, but to the rulers of the ten tribes as a whole. God gave the tribes who were discontented with the theocratical government of David and Solomon a king of their own, that He might punish them for their resistance to His government, which came to light in the rebellion against Rehoboam. He suspended the division of the kingdom not only over Solomon, as a punishment for his idolatry, but also over the rebellious ten tribes, who, when they separated themselves from the royal house to which the promise had been given of everlasting duration, were also separated from the divinely appointed worship and altar, and given up into the power of their kings, who hurled one another from the throne; and God took away this government from them to chastise them for their sins, by giving them into the power of the heathen, and by driving them away from His face. It is to this last thought, that what follows is attached. The removal of the king in wrath would occur, because the sin of Ephraim was reserved for punishment. </body></html>
