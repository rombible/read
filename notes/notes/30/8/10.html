The prophet threatens a famine of the word of Jehovah, and a parching thirst for the Water of Life, now no longer attainable. Such terrible destitution often supervenes on the neglect of the Word of God, the power to discern the ever-present Word being exhausted. Then comes the withdrawal of revelation, the silence of seers. One of the awful dooms of unbelief in the next world will be this famine, this hopeless thirst and fathomless suspense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/amos/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/amos/8-10.htm" title="And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.">Amos 8:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">I will turn your feasts into mourning </span>— God commanded the Jews to celebrate their festivals with joy and gladness; but this it would be impossible for them to do under such melancholy circumstances and manifestations of the divine displeasure. <span class="ital">And all your songs into lamentation — </span>The particular psalms and hymns which used to be sung at the great festivals are here alluded to. <span class="ital">And I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins — </span>All sorts of persons shall put on mourning. <span class="ital">And baldness upon every head — </span>Shaving the head and beard was a sign of the greatest sadness. <span class="ital">I will make it as the mourning, </span>rather, <span class="ital">as in the mourning of </span>[or <span class="ital">for</span>] <span class="ital">an only son — </span>That is, a most heavy mourning; for the death of an only son generally occasions the severest grief; <span class="ital">and the end thereof as a bitter day — </span>A sorrowful day, which you shall wish you had never seen, shall succeed your dark night.

They were weary of the restraints of the sabbaths and the new moons, and wished them over, because no common work might be done therein. This is the character of many who are called Christians. The sabbath day and sabbath work are a burden to carnal hearts. It will either be profaned or be accounted a dull day. But can we spend our time better than in communion with God? When employed in religious services, they were thinking of marketings. They were weary of holy duties, because their worldly business stood still the while. Those are strangers to God, and enemies to themselves, who love market days better than sabbath days, who would rather be selling corn than worshipping God. They have no regard to man: those who have lost the savour of piety, will not long keep the sense of common honesty. They cheat those they deal with. They take advantage of their neighbour's ignorance or necessity, in a traffic which nearly concerns the labouring poor. Could we witness the fraud and covetousness, which, in such numerous forms, render trading an abomination to the Lord, we should not wonder to see many dealers backward in the service of God. But he who thus despises the poor, reproaches his Maker; as it regards Him, rich and poor meet together. Riches that are got by the ruin of the poor, will bring ruin on those that get them. God will remember their sin against them. This speaks the case of such unjust, unmerciful men, to be miserable indeed, miserable for ever. There shall be terror and desolation every where. It shall come upon them when they little think of it. Thus uncertain are all our creature-comforts and enjoyments, even life itself; in the midst of life we are in death. What will be the wailing in the bitter day which follows sinful and sensual pleasures!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will turn your feasts into mourning - He recurs to the sentence which he had pronounced <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm">Amos 8:3</a>, before he described the avarice and oppression which brought it down. Hosea too had foretold, "I will cause all her mirth to cease, her feast-days, etc" <a href="/hosea/2-11.htm">Hosea 2:11</a>. So Jeremiah describes, "the joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning" <a href="/lamentations/5-15.htm">Lamentations 5:15</a>. The Book of Tobit bears witness how these sayings of <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/54.htm">Amos 54</a>ed in the hearts of the captive Israelites. The word of God seems oftentimes to fail, yet it finds those who are His. "I remembered," he said, "that prophecy of Amos, your feasts shall be turned into mourning" (Tobit 2:6).<p>The correspondence of these words with the miracle at our Blessed Lord's Passion, in that "the earth was darkened in the clear day, at noon-day," was noticed by the earliest fathers , and that the more, since it took place at the Feast of the Passover, and, in punishment for that sin, their "feasts were turned into mourning," in the desolation of their country and the cessation of their worship.<p>I will bring up sackcloth - (that is, the rough coarse haircloth, which, being fastened with the girdle tight over the loins (see above <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>, pp. 107, 109), was wearing to the frame) "and baldness upon every head." The mourning of the Jews was no half-mourning, no painless change of one color of becoming dress for another. For the time, they were dead to the world or to enjoyment. As the clothing was coarse, uncomely, distressing, so they laid aside every ornament, the ornament of their hair also (as English widows used, on the same principle, to cover it). They shore it off; each sex, what was the pride of their sex; the men, their beards; the women, their long hair. The strong words, "baldness, is balded <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>, shear <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>, hew off, enlarge thy baldness" , are used to show the completeness of this expression of sorrow. None exempted themselves in the universal sorrow; "on every head" came up "baldness."<p>And I will make it - (probably, the whole state and condition of things, everything, as we use our "it") as the mourning of an only son As, when God delivered Israel from Egypt, "there was not," among the Egyptians: "a house where there was not one dead <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>, and one universal cry arose from end to end of the land, so now too in apostate Israel. The whole mourning should be the one most grievous mourning of parents, over the one child in whom they themselves seemed anew to live.<p>And the end thereof as a bitter day - Most griefs have a rest or pause, or wear themselves out. "The end" of this should be like the beginning, nay, one concentrated grief, a whole day of bitter grief summed up in its close. It was to be no passing trouble, but one which should end in bitterness, an unending sorrow and destruction; image of the undying death in hell. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. baldness&#8212;a sign of mourning (Isa 15:2; Jer 48:37; Eze 7:18).<p>I will make it as &#8230; mourning of an only son&#8212;"it," that is, "the earth" (Am 8:9).

"Calling upon the name of Jehovah" signifies not only the public worship of God, but inward worship also, in which the confession of the mouth is also an expression of the heart. Upon Mount Zion will be pele&#772;ta&#770;h, i.e., not deliverance, but that which has escaped, or, in a collective sense, those who have escaped the judgment, as the synonym ser&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;m, which follows, clearly shows. Mount Zion and Jerusalem are not mentioned here as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, but, according to their spiritual significance, as the place where the Lord was enthroned in the sanctuary in the midst of His people; that is to say, as the central spot of the kingdom of God. Consequently it is not "to the whole nation of Judah as such that deliverance is promised, on the assumption that in those times of distress the population of the land would have streamed to Jerusalem" (Hitzig), but only to those who call upon the name of the Lord, i.e., to the true worshippers of God, upon whom the Spirit of God is poured out. The words &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497; are not synonymous with &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1497;&#1497; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-5.htm">Isaiah 40:5</a>, etc.), but point to a prophetic word already known, viz., to <a href="//biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>, where the saying of the Lord, that in the midst of the judgment there would be rescued ones upon Mount Zion, occurs word for word. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; also depends &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: "and among those that remain will be those whom Jehovah calls." Sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;d is one who is left after a judgment or a battle; hence in <a href="/jeremiah/42-17.htm">Jeremiah 42:17</a> and <a href="/joshua/8-22.htm">Joshua 8:22</a> it is connected with pa&#770;l&#305;&#772;t (one who has escaped from destruction), so that here ser&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;m and pele&#772;ta&#770;h are actually alike, the ser&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;m being just the escaped ones upon Mount Zion. Through this clause there is appended to what precedes the fresh definition, that among the saved will be found those whom the Lord calls. These may either be the believing portion of Judah, or believers from among the heathen. If we adopted the first view, the sentence would simply contain a more precise definition of the thought, that none are saved but those who call upon the name of the Lord, and therefore would preclude the possibility of including all the inhabitants of Judah among those who call upon the Lord. If we took the second view, the sentence would add this new feature to the thought contained in the first hemistich, that not only citizens of Jerusalem and Judah would be saved in the time of judgment, but all who called upon the Lord out of every nation. The latter view deserves the preference, because the expression &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1497;&#1497; did not need a more precise definition. The salvation of believers from the heathen world is implied in the first half of the verse, since it is simply connected with calling upon the name of the Lord. The Apostle Paul has quoted it in this sense in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>, as a proof of the participation of the heathen in the Messianic salvation.<p>If we proceed now to seek for the fulfilment of this prophecy, the Apostle Peter quoted the whole of these verses (28-32), with the exception of <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples, on the first Whitsuntide feast of the apostolical church, as having been fulfilled by that Whitsuntide miracle (<a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-21</a>); and in his subsequent reference to this fulfilment in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-39.htm">Joel 2:39</a>, "For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call," he even adds the closing words of Joel (<a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>).<p>(Note: In quoting this passage Peter follows the lxx on the whole, even in their deviations from the original text, viz., in &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; (<a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, <a href="/joel/2-29.htm">Joel 2:29</a>), in the addition of &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; and &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (<a href="/joel/2-29.htm">Joel 2:29</a>), in &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834; for &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; (<a href="/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4</a>), because these differences were of no consequence, so far as his object was concerned. On the other hand, he has interpreted &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1503;) by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and added for the same purpose, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. He has also transposed the two clauses &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; ... and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, probably simply for the purpose of letting the youths follow the sons and daughters, and placing the old men in the third row; and lastly, he has added &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834; ..., and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9; to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, to give greater prominence to the antithesis.)<p>Consequently the Christian church from time immemorial has recognised in the miracle of Pentecost the outpouring of the Spirit of God predicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a> :<p>(Note: See Hengstenberg, Christol. i. pp. 345, 346, translation.)<p>so that the only point upon which there has been a division of opinion has been, whether the fulfilment is to be confined to the feast of Pentecost (as nearly all the fathers and earlier Lutheran commentators suppose); or is to be sought for in certain events of Joel's own time, as well as the first feast of Pentecost (Ephr. Syr., Grot., and others); or, lastly, whether the occurrence at the first feast of Pentecost is to be regarded as simply the beginning of the fulfilment which has continued throughout the whole of the Christian era (Calov., Hengstenberg, and many others). Even the Rabbins, with the exception of R. Mose Hakkohen in Aben Ezra, who sees only a reference to some event in Joel's own time, expect the fulfilment to take place in the future on the advent of the Messiah (Yarchi, Kimchi, Abarb.). Of the three views expressed by Christian commentators, the third is the only one that answers to the nature of the prophecy as correctly interpreted. The outpouring of the Spirit of God, or the communication of it in all its fulness to the covenant nation, without any limitation whatever, is a standing mark with the prophets of the Messianic times (compare <a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a> with <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>) or new covenant (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>.; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). And even if the way was opened and prepared for this by the prophetic endowment of particular members of the old covenant, these sporadic communications of the Spirit of God in the Old Testament times cannot be regarded as the first steps in the fulfilment of our prophecy, since they were not outpourings of the Spirit of God. This first took place when Christ Jesus the Son of God had completed the work of redemption, i.e., on the first feast of Pentecost after the resurrection and ascension of Christ. Previous to this the words of <a href="/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a> applied: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x399;&#787;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;. The reference in this prophecy to the founding of the new covenant, or Christian church, is also evident from the words, "And it shall come to pass afterwards," for which Peter substituted, "And it shall come to pass in the last days," interpreting &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1503;, the use of which was occasioned by the retrospective reference to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>, with perfect correctness so far as the fact was concerned, by the formula answering to &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, viz., &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, which always denotes the Messianic future, or times of the completion of the kingdom of God. And just as acha&#774;re&#772; khe&#772;n precludes any reference to an event in Joel's own time, so does &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; preclude any fulfilment whatever in the times before Christ. But however certain it may be that the fulfilment first took place at the first Christian feast of Pentecost, we must not stop at this one pentecostal miracle. The address of the Apostle Peter by no means requires this limitation, but rather contains distinct indications that Peter himself saw nothing more therein than the commencement of the fulfilment, "but a commencement, indeed, which embraced the ultimate fulfilment, as the germ enfolds the tree." We see this in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, where he exhorts his hearers to repent and be baptized, and adds the promise, "and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost;" and again in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>, where he observes, "The promise belongs to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;), as many as the Lord our God will call." For if not only the children of the apostle's contemporaries, but also those that were afar off - i.e., not foreign Jews, but the far-off heathen - were to participate in the gift of the Holy Spirit, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit which commenced at Pentecost must continue as long as the Lord shall receive into His kingdom those who re still standing afar off, i.e., until the fulness of the Gentiles shall have entered the kingdom of God. See Hengstenberg, Christology, i. pp. 326ff. transl., where further reasons are adduced for taking this to be the allusion in the prophecy.<p>There is far greater diversity in the opinions entertained as to the fulfilment of <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30-32</a> : some thinking of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (Grotius, Turretius, and the Socinians); and others of judgments upon the enemies of the covenant nation shortly after the return from the Babylonian exile (Ephr. Syr. and others); others, again, of the last judgment (Tertull., Theod., Crus.), or the destruction of Jerusalem and the last judgment (Chrys.). Of all these views, those which refer to events occurring before the Christian era are irreconcilable with the context, according to which the day of the Lord will come after the outpouring of the Spirit of God. Even the wonders connected with the death of Christ and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, of which some have thought, cannot properly be taken into account, although the marvellous phenomena occurring at the death of Christ - the darkening of the sun, the shaking of the earth, and the rending of the rocks - were harbingers of the approaching judgment, and were recognised by the &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; as warnings to repent, and so escape from the judgment (<a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44</a>, <a href="/luke/23-48.htm">Luke 23:48</a>). For the signs in heaven and earth that are mentioned in <a href="/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30</a> and <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> were to take place before the coming of the terrible day of the Lord, which would dawn after the outpouring of the Spirit of God upon all flesh, and which came, as history teaches, upon the Jewish nation that had rejected its Saviour on the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and upon the Gentile world-power in the destruction of the Roman empire, and from that time forward breaks in constant succession upon one Gentile nation after another, until all the ungodly powers of this world shall be overthrown (cf. <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>). On account of this internal connection between the day of Jehovah and the outpouring of the Spirit upon the church of the Lord, Peter also quoted vv. 30-32 of this prophecy, for the purpose of impressing upon the hearts of all the hearers of his address the admonition, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation" (<a href="/acts/2-40.htm">Acts 2:40</a>), and also of pointing out the way of deliverance from the threatening judgment to all who were willing to be saved. </body></html>
