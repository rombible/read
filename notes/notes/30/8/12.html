The word is used of the reeling of drunkards, of the swaying to and fro of trees in the wind, of the quivering of the lips of one agitated, and then of the unsteady seeking of persons bewildered, looking for what they know not where to find. "From sea to sea," from the sea of Galilee to the Mediterranean, that is, from east to west, "and from the north even to the sunrising," round again to the east, from where their search had begun, where light should be, and was not. It may be, that Amos refers to the description of the land by Moses, adapting it to the then separate condition of Ephraim, "your south border shall be from the extremity of the Salt Sea (Dead Sea) eastward - and the goings out of it shall be at the sea, and for the western border ye shall have the great sea for a border. And this shall be your north border - and the border shall descend and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward" <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3-12</a>. Amos does not mention "the south," because "there" alone, where they might have found, where the true worship of God was, they did not seek. Had they sought God in Judah, instead of seeking to aggrandize themselves by its subdual, Tiglath-pileser would probably never have come against them. One expedition only in the seventeen years of his reign was directed westward , and that was at the petition of Ahaz.<p>The principle of God's dealings, that, in certain conditions of a sinful people, He will withdraw His word, is instanced in Israel, not limited to it. God says to Ezekiel, "I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb; and shalt not be to them a reprover, for it is a rebellious house" <a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a>; and Ezekiel says, "Destruction shall come upon destruction, and rumor shall be upon rumor, and they shall seek a vision from the prophet, and the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancients" <a href="/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a>. : "God turns away from them, and checks the grace of prophecy. For since they neglected His law, He on His side, stays the prophetic gift. "And the word was precious in those days, there was no open vision," that is, God did not speak to them through the prophets; He breathed not upon them the Spirit through which they spake. He did not appear to them, but is silent and hidden. There was silence, enmity between God and man." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. they shall wander from sea to sea&#8212;that is, from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean, from east to west.<p>from &#8230; north &#8230; to &#8230; east&#8212;where we might expect "from north to south." But so alienated was Israel from Judah, that no Israelite even then would think of repairing southward, that is, to Jerusalem for religious information. The circuit is traced as in Nu 34:3, &c., except that the south is omitted.

Bib. ch. 4.) Judgment upon the World of Nations, and Glorification of Zion- <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-1.htm">Joel 3:1</a>, <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>. "For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall turn the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I will gather together all nations, and bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will contend with them there concerning my people and my inheritance Israel, which they have scattered among the nations, and my land have they divided. <a href="/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>. And for my people they cast the lot; and gave the boy for a harlot, and the maiden they have sold for wine, and drunk (it)." The description of the judgment-day predicted in <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> commences with an explanatory &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. The train of thought is the following: When the day of the Lord comes, there will be deliverance upon Zion only for those who call upon the name of the Lord; for then will all the heathen nations that have displayed hostility to Jehovah's inheritance be judged in the valley of Jehoshaphat. By hinne&#772;h, the fact to be announced is held up as something new and important. The notice as to the time points back to the "afterward" in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> : "in those days," viz., the days of the outpouring of the Spirit of God. This time is still further described by the apposition, "at that time, when I shall turn the captivity of Judah," as the time of the redemption of the people of God out of their prostrate condition, and out of every kind of distress. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1488;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is not used here in the sense of "to bring back the prisoners," but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a>, in the more comprehensive sense of restitutio in integrum, which does indeed include the gathering together of those who were dispersed, and the return of the captives, as one element, though it is not exhausted by this one element, but also embraces their elevation into a new and higher state of glory, transcending their earlier state of grace. In  &#1493;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;  the prediction of judgment is appended to the previous definition of the time in the form of an apodosis. The article in  &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;  (all the nations) does not refer to "all those nations which were spoken of in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1-11</a> and 2 under the figure of the locusts" (Hengstenberg), but is used because the prophet had in his mind all those nations upon which hostility towards Israel, the people of God, is charged immediately afterwards as a crime: so that the article is used in much the same manner as in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>, because the notion, though in itself an indefinite one, is more fully defined in what follows (cf. Ewald, 227, a). The valley of Yeho&#772;sha&#770;pha&#770;t, i.e., Jehovah judges, is not the valley in which the judgment upon several heathen nations took place under Jehoshaphat (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>), and which received the name of Valley of blessing, from the feast of thanksgiving which Jehoshaphat held there (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-26</a>), as Ab. Ezra, Hofmann, Ewald, and others suppose; for the "Valley of blessing" was not "the valley of Kidron, which was selected for that festival in the road back from the desert of Tekoah to Jerusalem" (see Bertheau on 2 Chronicles c.), and still less "the plain of Jezreel" (Kliefoth), but was situated in the neighbourhood of the ruins of Bereiku&#770;t, which have been discovered by Wolcott (see Ritter, Erdkunde, xv. p. 635, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 292). On the other hand, the valley of Jehoshaphat is unquestionably to be sought for, according to this chapter (as compared with <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>), in or near Jerusalem; and the name, which does not occur anywhere else in either the Old or New Testament, excepting here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12</a>, is formed by Joel, like the name &#8219;e&#772;meq hecha&#770;ru&#772;ts in v. 14, from the judgment which Jehovah would hold upon the nations there. The tradition of the church (see Euseb. and Jerome in the Onom. s.v. &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;, Caelas, and Itiner. Anton. p. 594; cf. Robinson, Pal. i. pp. 396, 397) has correctly assigned it to the valley of the Kidron, on the eastern side of Jerusalem, or rather to the northern part of that valley (<a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>), or valley of Shaveh (<a href="/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>). There would the Lord contend with the nations, hold judgment upon them, because they had attacked His people (nacha&#774;la&#770;th&#305;&#772;, the people of Jehovah, as in <a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>) and His kingdom ('arts&#305;&#772;). The dispersion of Israel among the nations, and the division (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1511;) of the Lord's land, cannot, of course, refer to the invasion of Judah by the Philistines and Arabians in the time of Joram (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16-17</a>). For although these foes did actually conquer Jerusalem and plunder it, and carried off, among other captives, even the sons of the king himself, this transportation of a number of prisoners cannot be called a dispersion of the people of Israel among the heathen; still less can the plundering of the land and capital be called a division of the land of Jehovah; to say nothing of the fact, that the reference here is to the judgment which would come upon all nations after the outpouring of the Spirit of God upon all flesh, and that it is not till <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4-8</a> that Joel proceeds to speak of the calamities which neighbouring nations had inflicted upon the kingdom of Judah. The words presuppose as facts that have already occurred, both the dispersion of the whole nation of Israel in exile among the heathen, and the conquest and capture of the whole land by heathen nations, and that in the extent to which they took place under the Chaldeans and Romans alone. </body></html>
