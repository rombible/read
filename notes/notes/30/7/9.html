The remembrance of the mercies we formerly received, like the produce of the earth of the former growth, should make us submissive to the will of God, when we meet with disappointments in the latter growth. The Lord has many ways of humbling a sinful nation. Whatever trouble we are under, we should be most earnest with God for the forgiveness of sin. Sin will soon make a great people small. What will become of Israel, if the hand that should raise him be stretched out against him? See the power of prayer. See what a blessing praying people are to a land. See how ready, how swift God is to show mercy; how he waits to be gracious. Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself reared as a defence to his sanctuary. The Lord now seems to stand upon this wall. He measures it; it appears to be a bowing, bulging wall. Thus God would bring the people of Israel to the trial, would discover their wickedness; and the time will come, when those who have been spared often, shall be spared no longer. But the Lord still calls Israel his people. The repeated prayer and success of the prophet should lead us to seek the Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The high places of Isaac - He probably calls the ten tribes by the name of Isaac, as well as of Israel, in order to contrast their deeds with the blameless, gentle piety of Isaac, as well as the much-tried faithfulness of Israel. It has been thought too that he alludes to the first meaning of the name of Isaac. His name was given from the joyous laughter at the unheard-of promise of God, to give children to those past age; their high places should be a laughter, but the laughter of mockery . The "sanctuaries" were perhaps the two great idol-temples at Bethel and Dan, over against the one "sanctuary" of God at Jerusalem; the "high places" were the shrines of idolatry, especially where God had shown mercy to the patriarchs and Israel, but also all over the land. All were to be wasted, because all were idolatrous.<p>I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword - God speaks after the manner of people, who, having been still, arise against the object of their enmity. He makes Himself so far one with the instruments of His sentence, that, what they do, He ascribes to Himself. Jeroboam II must, from his military success, have been popular among his people. Successful valor is doubly prized, and he had both valor  and success. God had "saved Israel by" His "hand" <a href="/2_kings/14-27.htm">2 Kings 14:27</a>. A weak successor is often borne with for the merits of his father. There were no wars from without which called for strong military energy or talent, and which might furnish an excuse for superseding a faineant king. Ephraim had no ambition of foreign glory, to gratify. Zechariah, Jeroboam's son, was a sensualist ; but many sensualists have, at all times, reigned undisturbed. Shallum who murdered Zechariah was simply a "conspirator" <a href="/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>; he represented no popular impulse, and was slain himself a month <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13-14</a> after. Yet Amos foretells absolutely that the house of Jeroboam should perish by the sword, and in the next generation his name was clean put out. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/amos/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. high places&#8212;dedicated to idols.<p>of Isaac&#8212;They boasted of their following the example of their forefather Isaac, in erecting high places at Beer-sheba (Am 5:5; compare Ge 26:23, 24; 46:1); but he and Abraham erected them before the temple was appointed at Jerusalem&#8212;and to God; whereas they did so, after the temple had been fixed as the only place for sacrifices&#8212;and to idols. In the Hebrew here "Isaac" is written with s, instead of the usual ts; both forms mean "laughter"; the change of spelling perhaps expresses that their "high places of Isaac" may be well so called, but not as they meant by the name; for they are only fit to be laughed at in scorn. Probably, however, the mention of "Isaac" and "Israel" simply expresses that these names, which their degenerate posterity boasted in as if ensuring their safety, will not save them and their idolatrous "sanctuaries" on which they depended from ruin (compare Am 8:14).<p>house of Jeroboam with &#8230; sword&#8212;fulfilled in the extinction of Zachariah, son of Jeroboam II, the last of the descendants of Jeroboam I, who had originated the idolatry of the calves (2Ki 15:8-10).<p>Am. 7:10-17.

Worship at such local sanctuaries, down to the 7th cent. b.c., in so far as it was not contaminated with heathen elements, was regarded as quite regular (comp. <a href="/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-13.htm" title="As soon as you be come into the city, you shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden.

"Yet even now, is the saying of Jehovah, turn ye to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning. <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>. And rend your heart and not your garments, and turn back to Jehovah your God; for He is gracious and merciful, long-suffering, and great in kindness, and suffers Himself to repent of the evil. <a href="/joel/2-14.htm">Joel 2:14</a>. Who knoweth He turns and repents, and leaves behind Him blessing, meat-offering and drink-offering for Jehovah your God?" As the plague of locusts was intended to bring the people to reflect upon their conduct towards the Lord, so was the announcement of the great day of judgment and all its terrors made with no other object than to produce repentance and conversion, and thereby promote the good of the people of God. Joel therefore appends to the threatening of judgment a summons to sincere conversion to the Lord; and this he does by first of all addressing the summons to the people as a saying of Jehovah (v. 12), and then explaining this word of God in the most emphatic manner (vv. 13, 14). The Lord God requires conversion to Himself with all the heart (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; and for &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1506;&#1491;, <a href="/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>), associated with deep-rooted penitence on account of sin, which is to be outwardly manifested in fasting and mourning. But lest the people should content themselves with the outward signs of mourning, he proceeds in <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a> with the warning admonition, "Rend your heart, and not your garments." Rending the heart signifies contrition of heart (cf. <a href="/psalms/51-19.htm">Psalm 51:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). He then assigns the motive for this demand, by pointing to the mercy and grace of God, in the words of <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, with which the Lord made known to Moses His inmost nature, except that in the place of &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, which we find in this passage, he adds, on the ground of the facts recorded in <a href="/ezekiel/32-14.htm">Ezekiel 32:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>, &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;. On the strength of these facts he hopes, even in the present instance, for forgiveness on the part of God, and the removal of the judgment. "Who knoweth?" equivalent to "perhaps;" not because "too confident a hope would have had in it something offensive to Jehovah" (Hitzig), but "lest perchance they might either despair on account of the magnitude of their crimes, or the greatness of the divine clemency might make them careless" (Jerome).<p>(Note: "He speaks after the manner of a terrified conscience, which is lifted up again with difficulty after a season of affliction, and begins to aspire after hope and the mercy of God.
