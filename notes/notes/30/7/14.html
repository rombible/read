Prophecy, like other occupations, tended to form a hereditary guild, but Amos was not by birth a prophet. The word for “gatherer” is rendered in the LXX. and Vulg. “nipper,” or “pincher.” There was a custom mentioned in Theophrastus, <span class= "ital">Hist.

Those who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerful motives with others also. But those who have a warrant from God, like Amos, ought not to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. The Lord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours, can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And all who oppose or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects to their souls, unless they repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I was no prophet - The order of the words is emphatic. "No prophet I, and no prophet's son I, for a herdsman I, and dresser of sycamores." It may be, Amos would meet, for the people's sake, Amaziah's taunt. He had a living, simple indeed, yet that of the prophets was as simple. But chiefly he tells them of the unusual character of his mission. He did not belong to the order of the prophets, nor had he been educated in the schools of the prophets, nor had he any human training. He was thinking of nothing less; he was doing the works of his calling, until "God took him from following the flock," and gave him his commission. Rup.: "He promises humbly what he had been, what he had been made, not by merits, but by grace, that he had not assumed the prophetic office by hereditary right, nor had he begun to prophesy out of his own mind, but, being under the necessity of obeying, he had fulfilled the grace and the command of God who inspired and sent Him." Twice he repeats, "The Lord took me; the Lord said unto me;" inculcating that, what Amaziah forbade, God bade. All was of God. "He" had but obeyed. Jerome: "As then the Apostles, when the Scribes and Pharisees forbade them to teach in the Name of Jesus, answered, 'We must obey God rather than man' <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, so Amos, when forbidden by the idol-priests to prophesy, not only prophesies, shewing that he feared God bidding, more than their forbidding, but he boldly and freely denounces the punishment of him who endeavored to forbid and hinder the word of God." Rup.: "heaven thundered and commanded him to prophesy; the frog croaked in answer out of his marsh, 'prophesy no more.

I was no prophet&#8212;in answer to Amaziah's insinuation (Am 7:12), that he discharged the prophetical office to earn his "bread" (like Israel's mercenary prophets). So far from being rewarded, Jehovah's prophets had to expect imprisonment and even death as the result of their prophesying in Samaria or Israel: whereas the prophets of Baal were maintained at the king's expense (compare 1Ki 18:19). I was not, says Amos, of the order of prophets, or educated in their schools, and deriving a livelihood from exercising the public functions of a prophet. I am a shepherd (compare Am 7:15, "flock"; the Hebrew for "herdsman" includes the meaning, shepherd, compare Am 1:1) in humble position, who did not even think of prophesying among you, until a divine call impelled me to it.<p>prophet's son&#8212;that is, disciple. Schools of prophets are mentioned first in First Samuel; in these youths were educated to serve the theocracy as public instructors. Only in the kingdom of the ten tribes is the continuance of the schools of the prophets mentioned. They were missionary stations near the chief seats of superstition in Israel, and associations endowed with the Spirit of God; none were admitted but those to whom the Spirit had been previously imparted. Their spiritual fathers travelled about to visit the training schools, and cared for the members and even their widows (2Ki 4:1, 2). The pupils had their common board in them, and after leaving them still continued members. The offerings which in Judah were given by the pious to the Levites, in Israel went to the schools of the prophets (2Ki 4:42). Prophecy (for example, Elijah and Elisha) in Israel was more connected with extraordinary events than in Judah, inasmuch as, in the absence of the legal hierarchy of the latter, it needed to have more palpable divine sanction.<p>sycamore&#8212;abounding in Palestine. The fruit was like the fig, but inferior; according to Pliny, a sort of compound, as the name expresses, of the fig and the mulberry. It was only eaten by the poorest (compare 1Ki 10:27).<p>gatherer&#8212;one occupied with their cultivation [Maurer]. To cultivate it, an incision was made in the fruit when of a certain size, and on the fourth day afterwards it ripened [Pliny, Natural History, 13.7,14].

With much freedom, boldness, and intrepidity, and yet with modesty and humility; not at all moved by his frowns or his flattery: <p>I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son: he was not a prophet originally, or from his youth, as Kimchi; he was not born and bred one; neither his father was a prophet, by whom he could get any instructions in the mystery of prophesying; nor was he a disciple of any of the prophets, or brought up in any of their schools as some were; he was no prophet till the Lord called him immediately, at once, from his secular employment to this office; and therefore did not take it up to get a livelihood by Jarchi and Aben Ezra interpret it, that he was not one of the false prophets that prophesied for hire, and took a reward: <p>but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit; that is, originally: this was the employment he was brought up in from his youth, and was in it when he was called to be a prophet; he looked after cattle, both great and small; and at a certain time of the year used, to gather sycamore fruit, which was a kind of figs; and by, its name had the resemblance both of figs and mulberries. Some take it to be what were called Egyptian figs; these he gathered, either for the use of his masters, or for food for himself, or for the cattle, or both: or he was an "opener" of them, as the Septuagint; he cut, them, and made incisions in them; for, as Pliny (l), Dioscorides (m), and Theophrastus (n) observe, this fruit must be cut or scratched, either with the nail, or with iron, or it will not ripen; but, four days after being scratched or cut, will become ripe. Mr. Norden (o), a late traveller in Egypt, has given us a very particular account of this tree and its fruit. <p>"This sycamore (he says) is of the height of a beech, and bears its fruit in a manner quite different from other trees; it has them on the trunk itself, which shoots out little sprigs in form of grape stalks; at the end of which grow the fruit close to one another, almost like bunches of grapes. The tree is always green, and bears fruit several times in the year, without observing any certain seasons: for I have seen (says he) some sycamores that have given fruit two months after others. The fruit has the figure and smell of real figs, but is inferior to them in the taste, having a disgusting sweetness. Its colour is a yellow, inclining to an ochre, shadowed by a flesh colour. In the inside it resembles the common figs, excepting that it has a blackish colouring with yellow spots. This sort of tree is pretty common in Egypt; the people for the greater part live upon its fruit, and think themselves well regaled when they have a piece of bread, a couple of sycamore figs, and a pitcher filled with water from the Nile.'' <p>This account in several things agrees with what Pliny (p) and Solinus (q) relate of this tree and its fruit; very likely there might be many of these trees in Judea; there seem to have been great numbers of them in Solomon's time, <a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>; and perhaps it was one of these that Zacchaeus climbed, in order to see Christ, <a href="/luke/19-4.htm">Luke 19:4</a>; for this sort of trees delight in vales and plains, such as were the plains of Jericho; and in the Talmud (r) we read of sycamore trees in Jericho; and of the men of Jericho allowing the branches of them to be cut down for sacred uses. These also grew in lower Galilee, but not in upper Galilee; and that they were frequent in the land of Israel appears from the rules the Misnic doctors (s) give about the planting, and cutting them down; and in the opening of these trees, and making incisions in them, and in gathering the fruit of them, Amos might be concerned. Kimchi and Ben Melech say the word signifies to "mix", and that his business was to mix these together with other fruit. Aben Ezra observes, that in the Arabic language it signifies to dry; and then his work was, after he had gathered them, to lay them a drying. Some render the word a "searcher" (t) of them; as if his employment was to look out for them, and seek them where they were to be got: however, be this as it will, the prophet suggests that he had been used to a low life, and to mean fare, with which he was contented, and did not take up this business of prophesying for bread, and could return to his former employment without any regret, to get a maintenance, if so was the will of God. The Targum gives it a different sense, <p>"for I am a master of cattle, and have sycamores in the fields;'' <p>and so Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, represent him as suggesting that he was rich, and had no need of bread to be given him, or to prophesy for that. <p>(l) Nat.

The fruit is infested with an insect (the <span class="ital">Sycophaga crassipes</span>), and till the ‘eye’ or top has been punctured, so that the insects may escape, it is not eatable[185].

The exercise of the prophetical office was restricted neither to sex nor rank. There were many prophetesses in Israel, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Deborah (<a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>.), Huldah (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>), Noadiah (<a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and besides a large number of nameless prophets there are twenty-three whose names are preserved in Holy Writ, omitting those whose writings have come down to us (Ladd, 'Doctrine of Scripture,' 1:117, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">A prophet's son;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> brought up in the schools of the prophets, the pupils of which were called "sons of the prophets" (see <a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm">1 Kings 20:35</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5</a>). Amos was neither self-commissioned nor trained in any human institution. <span class="cmt_word">A herdman</span> (<span class="accented">boger</span>); usually "a cowherd;" here "a shepherd;" <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">A gatherer of sycomore fruit.</span> The phrase, <span class="accented">boles</span> <span class="accented">shiqmim</span>, may mean either one who plucks mulberry figs for his own sustenance, or one who cultivates them for others. The latter is probably the meaning of the term here. The Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "pricking sycamore fruit," and that of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">vellicans sycomoros</span>, indicate the artificial means for ripening the fruit, which was done by scraping, scratching, or puncturing it, as is sometimes done to the figs of commerce. As the tree bore many crops of fruit in the year, it would afford constant employment to the dresser (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' 3. p. 1394; 'Bible Educator,' 4, p. 343). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18</a> and <a href="/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a> contain the historical statement, that in consequence of the penitential prayer of the priests, the Lord displayed His mercy to His people, and gave them a promise, the first part of which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19-27</a>. <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18</a>, <a href="/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a>. "Then Jehovah was jealous for His land, and had compassion upon His people. And Jehovah answered, and said." The grammar requires that we should take the imperfects with Vav consec. in these clauses, as statements of what actually occurred. The passages in which imperfects with Vav cons. are either really or apparently used in a prophetic announcement of the future, are of a different kind; e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>, where we find one in a subordinate clause preceded by perfects. As the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1503; describes the promise which follows, as an answer given by Jehovah to His people, we must assume that the priests had really offered the penitential and supplicatory prayer to which the prophet had summoned them in <a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>. The circumstance that this is not expressly mentioned, neither warrants us in rendering the verbs in <a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a> in the present, and taking them as statements of what the priest really did (Hitzig), nor in changing the historical tenses in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18</a>, <a href="/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a> into futures. We have rather simply to supply the execution of the prophet's command between <a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a> and <a href="/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18</a>. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; with &#1500;, to be jealous for a person, i.e., to show the jealousy of love towards him, as in <a href="/exodus/39-25.htm">Exodus 39:25</a>; <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a> (see at <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). &#1495;&#1502;&#1500; as in <a href="/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-21.htm">1 Samuel 23:21</a>. In the answer from Jehovah which follows, the three features in the promise are not given according to their chronological order; but in order to add force to the description, we have first of all, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a>, a promise of the relief of the distress at which both man and beast had sighed, and then, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>, a promise of the destruction of the devastator; and it is not till <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-21.htm">Joel 2:21-23</a> that the third feature is mentioned in the further development of the promise, viz., the teacher for righteousness. Then finally, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23-27</a>, the fertilizing fall of rain, and the plentiful supply of the fruits of the ground that had been destroyed by the locusts, are more elaborately described, as the first blessing bestowed upon the people. </body></html>
