The remembrance of the mercies we formerly received, like the produce of the earth of the former growth, should make us submissive to the will of God, when we meet with disappointments in the latter growth. The Lord has many ways of humbling a sinful nation. Whatever trouble we are under, we should be most earnest with God for the forgiveness of sin. Sin will soon make a great people small. What will become of Israel, if the hand that should raise him be stretched out against him? See the power of prayer. See what a blessing praying people are to a land. See how ready, how swift God is to show mercy; how he waits to be gracious. Israel was a wall, a strong wall, which God himself reared as a defence to his sanctuary. The Lord now seems to stand upon this wall. He measures it; it appears to be a bowing, bulging wall. Thus God would bring the people of Israel to the trial, would discover their wickedness; and the time will come, when those who have been spared often, shall be spared no longer. But the Lord still calls Israel his people. The repeated prayer and success of the prophet should lead us to seek the Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/amos/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stood upon - (Rather "over" "a wall" made by "a plumbline;" lit.

A third vision, which was in the following manner: <p>and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand: this "wall" was the people of Israel, who were built up as a wall, firm and strong; and so stood against their enemies, while supported by the Lord, and he stood by them. The Septuagint version is, "an adamantine wall". In their constitution, both civil and ecclesiastic, they were formed according to the good and righteous laws of God, which may be signified by the plumbline; and so the Targum renders it, "the wall of judgment". And now the Lord appears standing upon this wall, to trample it down, and not to support it; and with a plumbline in his hand, to examine and try whether this wall was as it was first erected; whether it did not bulge out, and vary from its former structure, and was not according to the line and rule of his divine word, which was a rule of righteousness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/amos/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall <i>made</i> by a plumbline, <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> with a plumbline in his hand.</span><p>(e) Signifying that this would be the last measuring of the people, and that he would defer his judgment no longer.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/amos/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">upon</span>] or leaning <span class="ital">over</span> (cf. <a href="/amos/9-1.htm" title="I saw the LORD standing on the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that flees of them shall not flee away, and he that escapes of them shall not be delivered.">Amos 9:1</a>), i.e. (R.V.) <span class="bld">beside.</span> The prophet sees Jehovah <span class="ital">stationed</span> (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm" title="And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: the land where on you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed;">Genesis 28:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-13.htm" title="The LORD stands up to plead, and stands to judge the people.">Isaiah 3:13</a> a, <a href="/isaiah/21-8.htm" title="And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:">Isaiah 21:8</a> b),—<span class="ital">niẓẓâb</span>, implying a rather more set and formal attitude than <span class="ital">‘ômçd</span>, ‘standing,’—<span class="ital">beside a plummet-wall</span> (i.e. a wall built to the plummet), and holding <span class="ital">a plummet in his hand:</span> the design of the vision is thus to represent Him as a builder, whose aim is to secure that everything with which he has to do is built true.

As the word in other dialects means tin or lead, it is usually taken here to mean the plumb line which builders use to ascertain that their work is even and perpendiculur (see a very different explanation in Knabenbauer, p. 314, etc.). The "wall" is the kingdom of Israel, once carefully built up, solidly constructed, accurately arranged. God had made it upright; how was it now? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The whole universe trembles at this judgment of God. <a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>. "Before it the earth quakes, the heavens tremble: sun and moon have turned black, and the stars have withdrawn their shining. <a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>. And Jehovah thunders before His army, for His camp is very great, for the executor of His word is strong; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible, and who can endure it?" The remark of Jerome on <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>, viz., that "it is not that the strength of the locusts is so great that they can move the heavens and shake the earth, but that to those who suffer from such calamities, from the amount of their own terror, the heavens appear to shake and the earth to reel," is correct enough so far as the first part is concerned, but it by no means exhausts the force of the words. For, as Hitzig properly observes, the earth could only quake because of the locusts when they had settled, and the heavens could only tremble and be darkened when they were flying, so that the words would in any case be very much exaggerated. But it by no means follows from this, that &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; is not to be taken as referring to the locusts, like &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>, but to the coming of Jehovah in a storm, and that it is to be understood in this sense: "the earth quakes, the air roars at the voice of Jehovah, i.e., at the thunder, and storm-clouds darken the day." For although na&#770;than qo&#772;lo&#772; (shall utter His voice) in <a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a> is to be understood as referring to the thunder, Joel is not merely describing a storm, which came when the trouble had reached its height and put an end to the plague of locusts (Credner, Hitzig, and others). &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; cannot be taken in any other sense than that in which it occurs in <a href="/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>; that is to say, it can only refer to "the great people and strong," viz., the army of locusts, like &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;. Heaven and earth tremble at the army of locusts, because Jehovah comes with them to judge the world (cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>). The sun and moon become black, i.e., dark, and the stars withdraw their brightness ('a&#770;saph, withdraw, as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-19.htm">1 Samuel 14:19</a>), i.e., they let their light shine no more. That these words affirm something infinitely greater than the darkening of the lights of heaven by storm-clouds, is evident partly from the predictions of the judgment of the wrath of the Lord that is coming upon the whole earth and upon the imperial power (<a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>), at which the whole fabric of the universe trembles and nature clothes itself in mourning, and partly from the adoption of this particular feature by Christ in His description of the last judgment (<a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm">Mark 13:24-25</a>). Compare, on the other hand, the poetical description of a storm in <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>., where this feature is wanting. (For further remarks, see at <a href="/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>.) At the head of the army which is to execute His will, the Lord causes His voice of thunder to sound (na&#770;than qo&#772;l, to thunder; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>, etc.). The reason for this is given in three sentences that are introduced by k&#305;&#772;. Jehovah does this because His army is very great; because this powerful army executes His word, i.e., His command; and because the day of judgment is so great and terrible, that no one can endure it, i.e., no one can stand before the fury of the wrath of the Judge (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). </body></html>
