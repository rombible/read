All who are grown up, ought often to reflect upon the goodness of God to them in their childhood. He took care of them, took pains with them, not only as a father, or a tutor, but as a mother, or nurse. When they were in the wilderness, God showed them the way in which they should go, and bore them up, taking them by the arms. He taught them the way of his commandments by the ceremonial law given by Moses. He took them by the arms, to guide them, that they might not stray, and to hold them up, that they might not stumble and fall. God's spiritual Israel are all thus supported. It is God's work to draw poor souls to himself; and none can come to him except he draw them. With bands of love; this word signifies stronger cords than the former. He eased them of the burdens they had long groaned under. Israel is very ungrateful to God. God's counsels would have saved them, but their own counsels ruined them. They backslide; there is no hold of them, no stedfastness in them. They backslide from me, from God, the chief good. They are bent to backslide; they are ready to sin; they are forward to close with every temptation. Their hearts are fully set in them to do evil. Those only are truly happy, whom the Lord teaches by his Spirit, upholds by his power, and causes to walk in his ways. By his grace he takes away the love and dominion of sin, and creates a desire for the blessed feast of the gospel, that they may feed thereon, and live for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the sword shall abide on his cities - Literally, "shall light, shall whirl" down upon.

By God's appointment, "blood will have blood." Their own sword first came down and rested upon them; then the sword of the Assyrian.

Nay, they could not free themselves from invasion and attack. The sword of war would whirl down upon their cities and consume the branches, that is, the villages, or the city bars, or the strong warriors set for defense. Some understand the word so variously interpreted in the sense of "liars," and refer it to the prophets, priests, and politicians who spake falsehood and. acted deceitfully.

Again, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is, as already intimated, variously rendered. The most appropriate translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> is (literally, "<span class="accented">poles</span> for carrying the ark," <a href="/exodus/25-13.htm">Exodus 25:13</a>) "<span class="accented">bolts</span> or bars" for securing gates, the root being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;</span>, to separate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Some explain it as a figure for "<span class="accented">mighty</span> men;" so Jerome and the Targum, as also Rashi: "It destroys his heroes and consumes them." this is the meaning of the word preferred by Gesenius. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> Ewald understands it in the sense of "fortresses," especially on the frontier, by which a land is shut against or opened to the enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Aben Ezra and Kimchi take it to mean "branches," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> villages, and are followed by the Authorized Version. "The explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>," <span class="accented">says</span> Kimchi, "is ' branches,' and it is a figure for villages, for he had already mentioned his cities; and villages are related to cities as branches to a tree; in like manner they are called ' daughters,' being related to a city as daughters to a mother." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(e)</span> The LXX. render it by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, as also the Syriac. <span class="cmt_word">Because of their own counsels</span>. The cause of all their calamitous invasions, which city gates barred and bolted could not shut out, was their evil counsels in departing from the Lord, as Kimchi correctly explains: "All this comes upon them in consequence of their evil counsel, because they have forsaken my service to serve other gods." Rashi draws attention to the peculiarity of the accentuation - tasha and sellug - to separate it from the preceding word. The Septuagint here again blunders, obviously reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and translating, "And shall eat (the fruit) of their evil counsel." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son." Gomer does indeed occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2-3</a>, as the name of a people; but we never meet with it as the name of either a man or a woman, and judging from the analogy of the names of her children, it is chosen with reference to the meaning of the word itself. Gomer signifies perfection, completion in a passive sense, and is not meant to indicate destruction or death (Chald. Marck), but the fact that the woman was thoroughly perfected in her whoredom, or that she had gone to the furthest length in prostitution. Diblaim, also, does not occur again as a proper name, except in the names of Moabitish places in <a href="/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a> (&#8219;Almon-diblathaim) and <a href="/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a> (Beth-diblathaim); it is formed from debhe&#772;la&#770;h, like the form 'Ephraim, and in the sense of debhe&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, fig-cakes. "Daughter of fig-cakes," equivalent to liking fig-cakes, in the same sense as "loving grape-cakes" in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>, viz., deliciis dedita.<p>(Note: This is essentially the interpretation given by Jerome: "Therefore is a wife taken out of Israel by Hosea, as the type of the Lord and Saviour, viz., one accomplished in fornication, and a perfect daughter of pleasure (filia voluptatis), which seems so sweet and pleasant to those who enjoy it.")<p>The symbolical interpretation of these names is not affected by the fact that they are not explained, like those of the children in <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>., since this may be accounted for very simply from the circumstance, that the woman does not now receive the names for the first time, but that she had them at the time when the prophet married her. </body></html>
