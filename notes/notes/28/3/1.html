Gomer is now the concubine slave of another—possibly in poor and destitute condition. And yet the prophet’s love for her is like Jehovah’s love for “the children of Israel, even when they are turned to other gods, <span class= "ital">and love grape-cakes”</span>—the luscious sacrificial cakes used in idolatrous worship: a term generally descriptive of the licentious accompaniments of the Ashtoreth worship. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hosea/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/3-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.">Hosea 3:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then said the Lord unto me, Go yet, love a woman — </span>This is the literal meaning of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">עוד לךְ אהב אשׁה</span>, and is the sense in which It is understood by the LXX., who read, <span class="greekheb">ετι πορευθητι</span>, <span class="greekheb">και αγαπησον γυναικα</span>; and by the Vulgate, which renders it, <span class="ital">Adhuc vade et dilige mulierem. </span>A different woman from the person whom he had espoused before seems evidently to be intended. Thus St. Jerome and St. Cyril of Alexandria understand the words, considering the connection here spoken of as a new one, formed after the dismission of <span class="ital">Gomer; </span>in which opinion they are followed by Estius, Menochius, Tirinus, and many other expositors. The injunction, Archbishop Newcome supposes, was given after the death of Hosea’s former wife. But if not, it was undoubtedly given after she was divorced, for her unfaithfulness to her husband; in consequence of which, according to the law, he could not take her back again. <span class="ital">Beloved of her friend — </span>That is, her husband. But the LXX. render the words, <span class="greekheb">αγαπωσαν πονηρα</span>, <span class="ital">loving evil things; </span>a reading which accords with that of the Arabic and Syriac, and is approved both by Archbishop Newcome and Bishop Horsley; the former of whom renders the clause, <span class="ital">A lover of evil, </span>and the latter, <span class="ital">addicted to wickedness, </span>observing, “I adopt the rendering of the LXX. and Syriac, which nothing opposes but the Masoretic pointing.” <span class="ital">And an adulteress — </span>That is, who had been such, and that not only in the spiritual sense, of forsaking God, but according to the carnal meaning of the term. <span class="ital">According to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel — After the manner of Jehovah’s love for the children of Israel, who look to other gods, </span>or, <span class="ital">although they look to other gods, and are addicted to goblets of wine. </span>So Bishop Horsley, who observes, that <span class="ital">“children of Israel, </span>and <span class="ital">house of Israel, </span>are two distinct expressions, to be differently understood. The <span class="ital">house of Israel,</span> and sometimes <span class="ital">Israel </span>by itself, is a particular appellation of the ten tribes, a distinct kingdom from Judah. But the <span class="ital">children of Israel, </span>is a general appellation for the whole race of the Israelites, comprehending both kingdoms. Indeed it was the only general appellation, before the captivity of the ten tribes; afterward, the kingdom of Judah only remaining, <span class="ital">Jews </span>came into use as the name of the whole race, which before had been the appropriate name of the kingdom of Judah. It occurs, for the first time 2 Kings 16., in the history of Ahaz. It is true, we read in <a href="/hosea/1-11.htm" title="Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.">Hosea 1:11</a>, of <span class="ital">the children of Judah, and the children of Israel; </span>but this is only an honourable mention of Judah, as the principal tribe, not as a distinct kingdom. And the true exposition of the expression is, ‘the children of Judah, and all the rest of the children of Israel.’ We find Judah thus particularly mentioned, as a principal part of the people, before the kingdoms were separated: see <a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.">2 Samuel 24:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm" title="Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.">1 Kings 4:20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm" title="And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.">1 Kings 4:25</a>. And yet, at that time, Israel was the general name, <a href="/1_kings/4-1.htm" title="So king Solomon was king over all Israel.">1 Kings 4:1</a>.” The expression, <span class="ital">And love flagons of wine, </span>implies, that they loved to drink wine in the temples of their idols. They were wont to pour out wine to their false gods, and, it is probable, drank the remainder even to excess. The festivity, or rather dissoluteness, which was used by the heathen in the worship of their gods, seems to have been one principal thing that made the Israelites so fond of their rites of worship. Some think that the words, rendered here <span class="ital">flagons, </span>or <span class="ital">goblets, of wine, </span>should be translated <span class="ital">cakes of dried grapes. </span>The expression, <span class="ital">according to the love of the Lord, </span>&c., means, Let this be an emblem of my love to the children of Israel; or, By this I intend to let Israel know how I have loved them, and what returns they have made for my love. How great and constant my love has been to them, and how inconstant and insincere theirs has been to me. The words seem, in general, to express their leaving the service of the true God, and imitating the idolaters, in following after false gods, bodily delights and pleasures, as gluttony, drunkenness, and the like, which the service of idols did not only permit, but require.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-3 The dislike of men to true religion is because they love objects and forms, which allow them to indulge, instead of mortifying their lusts. How wonderful that a holy God should have good-will to those whose carnal mind is enmity against Him! Here is represented God's gracious dealings with the fallen race of mankind, that had gone from him. This is the covenant of grace he is willing to enter into with them, they must be to him a people, and he will be to them a God. They must accept the punishment of their sin, and must not return to folly. And it is a certain sign that our afflictions are means of good to us, when we are kept from being overcome by the temptations of an afflicted state.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Go yet, love a woman, beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress - This woman is the same Gomer, whom the prophet had before been bidden to take, and whom, (it appears from this verse) had forsaken him, and was living in adultery with another man. The "friend"  is the husband himself, the prophet. The word "friend" expresses, that the husband of Gomer treated her, not harshly, but mildly and tenderly so that her faithlessness was the more aggravated sin. "Friend or neighbor" too is the word chosen by our Lord to express His own love, the love of the good Samaritan, who, not being akin, became "neighbor to Him who fell among thieves," and had mercy upon him. Gomer is called "a woman,"  in order to describe the state of separation, in which she was living. Yet God bids the prophet to "love her," i. e., show active love to her, not, as before, to "take" her, for she was already and still his with, although unfaithful. He is now bidden to buy her back, with the price and allowance of food, as of a worthless slave, and so to keep her apart, on coarse food, abstaining from her former sins, but without the privileges of marriage, yet with the hope of being, in the end, restored to be altogether his wife. This prophecy is a sequel to the former, and so relates to Israel, after the coming of Christ, in which the former prophecy ends.<p>According to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel - The prophet is directed to frame his life, so as to depict at once the ingratitude of Israel or the sinful soul, and the abiding, persevering, love of God. The woman, whom God commands him to love, he had loved before her fall; he was now to love her after her fall, and amid her fall, in order to rescue her from abiding in it. His love was to outlive her's, that he might win her at last to him. Such, God says, "is the love of the Lord for Israel." He loved her, before she fell, for the woman was "beloved of her friend, and yet an adulteress." He loved her after she fell, and while persevering in her adultery. For God explains His command to the prophet still to love her, by the words, "according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel, while they look to other gods, literally, and they are looking." The words express a contemporary circumstance. God was loving them and looking upon them; and they, all the while, were looking to other gods.<p>Love flagons of wine - Literally, "of grapes," or perhaps, more probably, "cakes of grapes," i. e., dried raisins. Cakes were used in idolatry <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a>. The "wine" would betoken the excess common in idolatry, and the bereavement of understanding: the cakes denote the sweetness and lusciousness, yet still the dryness, of any gratification out of God, which is preferred to Him. Israel despised and rejected the true Vine, Jesus Christ, the source of all the works of grace and righteousness, and "loved the dried cakes," the observances of the law, which, apart from Him, were dry and worthless. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Ho 3:1-5.

Or, as the Targum, <p>"the Lord said unto me again''; <p>for the word yet or again is to be joined to this, and not the following clause; and shows that this is a new vision, prophecy, or parable, though respecting the same persons and things: <p>go, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress; not the prophet's wife, not Gomer, but some other feigned person; beloved either of her own husband, as the Targum and Jarchi, notwithstanding her unchastity and unfaithfulness to him; or of another man, as Aben Ezra, who had a very great respect for her, courted her, and perhaps had betrothed her, but had not yet consummated the marriage; and, though a harlot, loved her dearly, and could not get off his affections from her, but hankered after her; or of the prophet, as Kimchi, who paraphrases it, <p>"thou shall love her, and be to her a friend;'' <p>to protect and defend her, as harlots used to have one in particular they called their friend, by whose name they were called, and was a cover to them. The sense is, that the prophet was to go to the people of Israel, and deliver this parable to them, setting forth their state and condition, and their behaviour towards God, and his great love to them, notwithstanding all their baseness and ingratitude; it was as if a woman that was either married or betrothed, or that either had a husband or a suitor that so dearly loved her, that though she was guilty of uncleanness, and continued in it, yet would not leave her; and which is thus expressed by the Targum, <p>"go, deliver a prophecy against the house of Israel, who are like a woman dear to her husband; and though she commits fornication against him, yet he so loves her that he will not put her away:'' <p>according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel; or such is the love of the Lord to them; for though they were guilty of idolatry, intemperance, and other immoralities, yet still he loved them, and formed designs of grace and goodness for them. And thus, though God does not love sinners as such; yet he loves them, though they are sinners, and when and while they are such; as appears by his choice of them, and covenant with them, by Christ's dying for them while sinners, and by his quickening them when dead in trespasses and sins: <p>who look to other gods; or "though they look to other gods" (c); look to them and worship them, pray unto them, put their trust in them, and expect good things from them: <p>and love flagons of wine, or "tubs of grapes" (d); or of wine made of them; or lumps of raisins, cakes or junkets made of them and other things, as the Septuagint; and may respect either the drunkenness and intemperance of the ten tribes; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a>, they loved, as Kimchi says, the delights of the world, and not the law and commandments of God; or the feasts that were made in the temples of their idols they loved good eating and drinking, and that made them like idolatry the better for the sake of those things; see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>, for the Heathens used to eat and drink to excess at their sacrifices: hence Diogenes (e) the philosopher was very angry with those who sacrificed to the gods for their health, yet in their sacrifices feasted to the prejudice of their health. <p>(c)  "quamvis respiciant", Piscator.

And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitutions and children of prostitutions: for the land has committed great prostitution, departing from the LORD.">Hosea 1:2</a>), besides which the allegory would have been spoiled had there been two women concerned. Gomer is throughout the symbol of faithless but not forsaken Israel. The narrative is told in a condensed allusive style, which makes some demand on the imagination of the reader. If Gomer is to be taken back, it is clear that she must have left her husband, and the price at which (<span class="ital"><a href="/hosea/3-2.htm" title="So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:">Hosea 3:2</a></span>) she has to be brought back shews that she had fallen into depths of misery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">beloved of a paramour, and an adulteress.</span> As if Jehovah had said, Love her just as she is; the definition is added for the reader’s sake, to show how great an act was demanded of Hosea, like ‘Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest’ (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>). For the rendering ‘paramour’, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm" title="Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 3:20</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-2.htm" title="She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she has none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.">Lamentations 1:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who look</span> …] Rather, <span class="bld">whereas they</span> (on their side) <span class="bld">turn.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">flagons of wine</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">cakes of grapes</span>.

The cakes here mentioned, however, must have been of a superior kind; they bear a different name, and appear from <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm" title="Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall you mourn; surely they are stricken.">Isaiah 16:7</a> (corrected translation) to have been considered as luxuries.

So all the people departed every one to his house.">2 Samuel 6:19</a>), or more correctly of the sacrificial feast implied by the context. This latter point is interesting as it suggests that Baal-worship was closely related to the festivities of the vintage (Prof. Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">The Old Testament in the Jewish Church</span>, p. 434). Hosea too seems to refer to these cakes in connexion with the sacrificial feasts, not without a touch of sarcasm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I bought her to me</span>] Why Hosea had to buy his wife back from her paramour, does not appear; had he lost his rights over her by her flight and adultery? Perhaps it was simply to avoid an altercation with the adulterer, or we may imagine such a scene as is depicted by Dean Plumptre in his poem Gomer’ (<span class="ital">Lazarus</span> p. 87). The view of Pococke and Pusey that Hosea means to explain how he undertook to allow his wife just sufficient for a decent maintenance till she should be reinstated in her full position, accounts no doubt for grain being given as well as money, but does violence to the letter of the text, as there is no sufficient proof of the rendering ‘I provided her with food’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a homer of barley, and a half homer of barley</span>] In <a href="/2_kings/7-18.htm" title="And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:">2 Kings 7:18</a> two seahs of barley are rated at a shekel. This however was immediately after the siege of Samaria had been raised; the normal rate would probably have been lower, say three seahs at a shekel, so that a homer (= 30 seahs) would have cost ten shekels and a homer and a half fifteen. The total price paid by Hosea would therefore be thirty shekels (about <span class="ital">£</span> 3. 15<span class="ital">s.</span>) the average value of a slave (see <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm" title="If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.">Exodus 21:32</a>). Why it was paid partly in money, partly in kind, cannot be determined. Hosea only tells us enough to make the allegory intelligible. Gomer in her misery is a type of Israel in her unhappy alienation from her God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a half-homer</span>] Strictly, <span class="bld">a lethech.</span> The Sept. has ‘a bottle of wine’ (<span class="greekheb">νέβελ οἴνου</span>). Probably the translator was unacquainted with the ‘lethech’, which was apparently not a primitive measure. Its precise relation to the homer is uncertain; A.V. however is borne out by the Jewish tradition. There is nothing analogous to it in the Egyptian dry measure, which in other details agrees exactly with the Hebrew (Révillout, <span class="ital">Revue égyptologique</span> 11. 190).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The general meaning of this verse is well given in the Chaldee Targum: "Go, utter a prophecy against the house of Israel, who are like a woman very dear to her husband, and who, though she is unfaithful to him, is nevertheless so greatly loved by him that he is unwilling to put her away. Such is the love of the Lord towards Israel; but they turn aside to the idols of the nations." The word <span class="accented">mr</span> is in contrast with '<span class="accented">techillath</span>, as the second part of Jehovah's continued discourse. It is erroneously and, contrary to the accents, constructed with "said" by Kimchi and others (Ewald considers it admissible, Umbreit preferable). Kimchi's comment on this verse is: "After the prophet finished his words of consolation, he returns to words of censure, turning to the men of his own time. And it is the custom of the prophets to intermingle reproofs with consolations in their discourses. But he says <span class="accented">yet</span> (again), because he had already commanded him to marry a wife of whoredoms, and now he speaks to him another parable." This time he does not employ the ordinary and usual word "take," but "love." plainly implying that he had already married her, so that her unfaithfulness took place in wedlock; or rather indicating the object of the union. <span class="cmt_word">Beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress</span>. Her friend or companion is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> her lawful husband, but contemporaneously and continuously with her husband's love to her are her adulteries with others, as is implied by the participles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;</span>, being indefinite as not having article or suffix, is understood by some to be an acquaintance or lover, and preferred, as a milder term, to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>. The contrast was realized in Jehovah's love for Israel, notwithstanding their spiritual adultery in worshipping other gods. <span class="cmt_word">According to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel who look</span> (turn) <span class="cmt_word">to other gods</span>. Two expressions in this clause recall, if they do not actually reflect, the words of two older Scriptures; thus in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a> we read, "Because the Lord loved you;" and in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-18.htm">Deuteronomy 31:18</a>, "They are turned unto ether gods." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And love flagons of wine</span> (margin, <span class="accented">grapes</span>). The term <span class="accented">ashishe</span>, according to Rashi and Aben Ezra, means "bowls," that is, "bowls of wine" (literally, "of grapes"). They probably connected the word with the root <span class="accented">shesh</span>, six, a sextorius, and hence any other wine-vessel. The Septuagint, however, renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "cakes with dried grapes." This meaning is to be preferred, whether we derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, to press together, or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire; according to the former and correct derivation, the sense being cakes of grapes pressed together; according to the latter, cakes baked with fire. Gesenius differentiates the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, dried grapes, but not pressed together into a cake, and from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, figs pressed together into a cake. These raisin-cakes were regarded as luxuries and used as delicacies; hence a fondness for such indicated a proneness to sensual indulgence, and figuratively the sensuous service belonging to idol-worship. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Since, from the explanation given by the angel in this verse, the vision relates to the Medo-Persian and the Javanic world-kingdoms, and to the persecuting kingdom of Antiochus which arose out of the latter, so it cannot be disputed that here, in prophetic perspective, the time of the end is seen together with the period of the oppression of the people of God by Antiochus, and the first appearance of the Messiah with His return in glory to the final judgment, as the latter is the case also in <a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>., 44f., and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. If Kliefoth objects: The coming of the Messiah may certainly be conceived of as bound up with the end of all things, and this is done, since both events stand in intimate causal relation to each other, not seldom in those O.T. prophets who yet do not distinguish the times; but they also know well that this intimate causal connection does not include contemporaneousness, that the coming of the Messiah in the flesh will certainly bring about the end of all things, but not as an immediate consequence, but after a somewhat lengthened intervening space, that thus, after the coming of the Messiah, a course of historical events will further unfold themselves before the end comes (which Daniel also knew, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> shows), and where the supposition is this, as in Daniel, there the time before the appearance of Christ in the flesh cannot be called the time of the end: - then the inference drawn in these last passages is not confirmed by the contents of the book of Daniel. For in the last vision (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10-12</a>) which Daniel saw, not only the time of oppression of Antiochus and that of the last enemy are contemplated together as one, but also the whole contents of this one vision are, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>, transferred to the "end of the days;" for the divine messenger says to Daniel, "I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the end of the days, for the vision yet relates to the days." And not only this, but also in <a href="/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a> it is said of the tribulation brought upon the people of God by Antiochus, that in it many would fall, to cleanse them and to purify them to the time of the end, for it is yet for the appointed time. Here, beyond doubt, the time of the persecution by Antiochus is placed in intimate union with the time of the end, but, as is to be particularly observed, not so that the two are spoken of as synchronous. This point is of importance for the right exposition of the verse before us. If, in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>, it is twice said la&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1511;&#1509; &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (the end is yet for the appointed time), and thus does not begin with the oppression of the people of God by Antiochus, so we may not conclude from these verses - and in this Kliefoth is perfectly justified - that Daniel expected the erection of the Messianic kingdom and the end of all history with the overthrow of Antiochus. If, however, on the whole, the intimate causal connection of the two periods of tribulation placed together in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> in one vision neither demands nor even permits us to regard the two as synchronous, so this erroneous conclusion drawn from these verses before us, in connection with an incorrect interpretation of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36-45</a>, is sufficiently obviated, both by <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> and 7, according to which the fourth world-kingdom shall precede the erection of the everlasting kingdom of God and the manifestation of the Son of man, as also by <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, where - as our exposition will show - the coming of the Messiah and the perfecting of the kingdom of God by the overthrow of the last enemy are dependent on one another in point of time - the coming of the Messiah after seven weeks, the perfecting of the kingdom of God will follow, but not trill after the lapse of seventy weeks.<p>This passage is to be understood according to these distinct revelations and statements, and not that because in them, according to prophetic perspective, the oppression of the people of the saints by Antiochus, the little horn, is seen in one vision with the tribulation of the end-time, therefore the synchronism or identity of the two is to be concluded, and the erection of the regnum gloriae and the end of the world to be placed at the destruction of this little horn. The words, "the vision relates to the time of the end," thus only declare that the prophecy has a reference to Messianic times. As to the nature of this reference, the angel gives some intimation when, having touched the prophet, who had fallen in amazement to the ground, he raised him up and enabled him to listen to his words (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>), the intimation that he would make known to him what would happen in the last time of violence (<a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>). &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; is the wrath of God against Israel, the punishment which God hung over them on account of their sins, as in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-17.htm">Jeremiah 25:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-24.htm">Ezekiel 22:24</a>, etc., and here the sufferings of punishment and discipline which the little horn shall bring over Israel. The time of this revelation of divine wrath is called &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; because it belongs to the &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, prepares the Messianic future, and with its conclusion begins the last age of the world, of which, however, nothing more particular is here said, for the prophecy breaks off with the destruction of the little horn. The vision of the eleventh chapter first supplies more particular disclosures on this point. In that chapter the great enemy of the saints of God, arising out of the third world-kingdom, is set forth and represented as the prefiguration or type of their last enemy at the end of the days. Under the words &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (which shall be) the angel understands all that the vision of this chapter contains, from the rising up of the Medo-Persian world-kingdom to the time of the destruction of Antiochus Epiphanes, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-25</a> show. But when he adds &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, he immediately makes prominent that which is the most important matter in the whole vision, the severe oppression which awaits the people of Israel in the future for their purification, and repeats, in justification of that which is said, the conclusion from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, in which he only exchanges &#1506;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is the definite time in its duration; &#1511;&#1509; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; thus denotes the end-time as to its duration. This expression is here chosen with regard to the circumstance that in <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a> the end of the oppression was accurately defined by the declaration of its continuance. The object of these words also is variously viewed by interpreters. The meaning is not that the angel wished to console Daniel with the thought that the judgment of the vision was not yet so near at hand (Zndel); for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, Daniel was not terrified by the contents of the vision, but by the approach of the heavenly being; and if, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>, the words of the angel so increased his terror that he fell down confounded to the earth, and the angel had to raise him by touching him, yet it is not at the same time said that the words of the angel of the end-time had so confounded him, and that the subsequent fuller explanation was somewhat less overwhelming than the words, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, something lighter or more comforting. Even though the statement about the time of the end contributed to the increase of the terror, yet the contents of <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a> were not fitted to raise up the prophet, but the whole discourse of the angel was for Daniel so oppressive that after hearing it, he was for some days sick, <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>. From Daniel's astonishment we are not to conclude that the angel in <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a> spoke of the absolute end of all things, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, on the contrary, of the end of the oppression of the people of Israel by Antiochus. By the words, "the vision relates to the appointed end-time," the angel wished only to point to the importance of his announcement, and to add emphasis to his call to the prophet to give heed.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-26</a><p>After the introductory words, we have now in these verses the explanation of the chief points of the vision.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-22</a> explain <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3-8</a>. "The kings of Media and Persia" are the whole number of the Medo-Persian kings as they succeed each other, i.e., the Medo-Persian monarchy in the whole of its historical development. To &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; the epithet &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, hairy, shaggy, is added to characterize the animal as an he-goat. The king of Javan (Greece) is the founder and representative of the Macedo-Grecian world-kingdom, or rather the royalty of this kingdom, since the great horn of the ram is forthwith interpreted of Alexander the Great, the first king of this kingdom. The words &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; to &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; (<a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a>) form an absolute subject-sentence, in which, however, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is not to be taken &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, it broke in pieces, so that ... (Kran.); for "the statement of the principal passage may not appear here in the subordinate relative passage" (Hitzig); but to the statement beginning with the participle the further definition in the verb. in. with  &#1493;consec. is added, without the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as is frequently the case (cf. Ewald's Lehr. 351), which we cannot give with so much brevity, but must express thus: "as concerning the horn, that it was broken in pieces, and then four stood up in its place, (this signifies) that four kingdoms shall arise from the people." &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; without the article does not signify from the people of Javan, for in this case the article would not have been omitted; nor does it signify from the heathen world, because a direct contrast to Israel does not lie before us; but indefinitely, from the territory of the people, or the world of the people, since the prophecy conceives of the whole world of the people (Vklerwelt) as united under the sceptre of the king of Javan. &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is a revived archaism; cf. <a href="/genesis/30-38.htm">Genesis 30:38</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>; Ewald, 191; Gesen.
