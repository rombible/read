The low price at which the prophet purchased this woman, was significative how base and of little value the Israelites were, since their apostacy from the worship of God to idolatry. Or, according to Calvin, “the parsimonious gift, a sum of money which was but half the price of a female slave, and a pittance of black barley bread, typified the hard fare which the Israelites were to expect at the hand of God in their state of exile.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-3 The dislike of men to true religion is because they love objects and forms, which allow them to indulge, instead of mortifying their lusts.

The homer and half-homer of barley, or forty-five bushels, are nearly the allowance of food for a slave among the Romans, four bushels a month. Barley was the offering of one accused of adultery, and, being the food of animals, betokens that she was "like horse and mule which have no understanding." The Jews gave dowries for their wives; but she was the prophet's wife already. It was then perhaps an allowance, whereby he bought her back from her evil freedom, not to live as his wife, but to be honestly maintained, until it should be fit, completely to restore her. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. I bought her&#8212;The price paid is too small to be a probable dowry wherewith to buy a wife from her parents; but it is just half the price of a female slave, in money, the rest of the price being made up in grain (Ex 21:32). Hosea pays this for the redemption of his wife, who has become the slave of her paramour. The price being half grain was because the latter was the allowance of food for the slave, and of the coarsest kind, not wheat, but barley. Israel, as committing sin, was the slave of sin (Joh 8:34; Ro 6:16-20; 2Pe 2:19). The low price expresses Israel's worthlessness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hosea/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">So I bought her; </span> as I was commanded, I procured, or, as we read it, bought her: which exactly answers to the state of the Jews when in Egypt, tainted with Egyptian idolatry, and poor, without a portion; bought or redeemed to be affianced to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fifteen pieces of silver; </span> whatever was the exact quantity and value of these pieces we need not here curiously inquire; but note, it was half the value of a slave, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/21-32.htm" title="If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.">Exodus 21:32</a></span>, and was some 37s. 6d. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">An homer:</span> this measure might be about fourteen bushels; so the whole will, for her diet, amount to twenty-one bushels, no great provision for her diet; and it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">barley</span> in both places, the meanest kind of provision, and suited to a low condition, <span class="bld"><a href="/judges/7-13.htm" title="And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.">Judges 7:13</a> <a href="/ezekiel/4-9.htm" title="Take you also to you wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make you bread thereof, according to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days shall you eat thereof.">Ezekiel 4:9</a>,12</span>: all this the fuller to set forth Israel’s indigence and ingratitude to God, and God’s bounty to Israel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hosea/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver,.... Or, "fifteen shekels", which was about one pound seventeen shillings and six pence of our money, reckoning a shekel at two shillings and six pence; though some make it to be but two shillings and four pence; this was but half the price of a servant, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>, and alludes to the dowry which men used to give to women at their marriage; see <a href="/1_samuel/18-25.htm">1 Samuel 18:25</a>. The word here used has the signification of digging; hence the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "I dug her"; and the abettors and defenders of it think it refers to the digging, or boring the ears of a servant that chose to continue with his master, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>, but the word is used in the sense of buying, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>, and so Jarchi says it has the sense of merchandise or bargaining; and in the sea coasts he observes, that they call  a purchase,  Perhaps the word is better rendered by the Septuagint and Arabic versions, "hired"; and "cara" in the Arabic language signifies "to hire"; so it is used in <a href="/acts/28-30.htm">Acts 28:30</a>. So with the Turks, as Monsieur Thevenot (f) observes, a letter out of beasts to hire is called "moucre" or "moukir", which comes from the Arabic word "kira", he says, which signifies to let or hire; and is here fitly used of a harlot. The Jews have many whims and fancies about these fifteen pieces of silver. The Targum, and Pesikta in Jarchi, take them to respect the fifteenth day of Nisan, on which the Israelites were redeemed out of Egypt; according to Aben Ezra, they design the fifteen kings of Judah, from Rehoboam to the captivity, reckoning the sons of Josiah as one, being brethren; according to others, in Kimchi, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the twelve tribes; and, according to Abarbinel, the fifteen prophets that prophesied of the redemption: <p>and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley; a "homer" held ten "ephahs", and a "lethec", or "half homer", five "ephahs", or so many bushels, these making the number fifteen: again, according to Saadiah, they design Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, and the twelve tribes; and, according to Aben Ezra, the number of the high priests in the kingdom of Judah and Jerusalem, a homer making thirty seahs, and a half homer fifteen, in all forty five; but according to others, in Kimchi, these design the forty five days between the coming of the Israelites out of Egypt and their receiving the law: but, leaving these fancies, as the number of shekels given for her was but a low price, and shows what an estimate was made of her; and barley being the coarsest of grain, and bread made of it, that of the worst sort, which the poorer people eat; may be expressive of the captive, servile, mean, and abject state of the people of Israel, from the time of their captivity to their conversion to Christ, as is after more fully explained. <p>(f) Travels, part 2.

In narrating the prophet's compliance with the Divine command, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;</span>is connected by Aben Ezra with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> in the sense of making acquaintance with; but it is more correctly referred by Kimchi to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> with daghesh euphonic in the <span class="accented">caph</span> as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> shall meet thee. "The daghesh of the <span class="accented">caph</span> is for euphony as in <span class="accented">miqdush</span>, and the root is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (Kimchi). The meaning is then simply and naturally traced as follows: to dig, obtain by digging, acquire. The price paid for the acquisition in this case was either the purchase money paid to the parents of the bride, as to Laban in the case of Rachel and Leah by Jacob, or the marriage present paid (<span class="accented">mohar</span>) to the bride herself. Another view represents the prophet paying the price to the woman's husband to whom she had been unfaithful, and who in consequence resigned her for so small a sum. It remains for us to attend to the amount thus paid. Fifteen pieces of silver or shekels would be about one pound fifteen shillings, or one pound seventeen and six-pence; while the price of the barley would he somewhere about the same. There were fifty or sixty shekels in a <span class="accented">mana</span>, Greek <span class="accented">mina</span>, and Latin <span class="accented">ulna</span>; while the maneh was cue-sixtieth of a talent (<span class="accented">kikteer</span>); and thus three thousand or three thousand six hundred shekels in a talent. The homer, the largest of the Hebrew dry measures, contained one cor or ten ephahs (  =   ten baths of liquids   =   ten Attic <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and the half-homer or <span class="accented">lethec</span> (<span class="accented">haemi-coros</span> in LXX.) was half a cop or five ephahs. These fifteen ephahs, at a shekel each - for under extraordinary circumstances (<a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>) we read of" two measures of barley for a shekel" - would be equivalent to one pound fifteen or seventeen shillings and sixpence. Both together  - the silver and the barley - would amount to thirty shekels, or three pounds and ten or fifteen shillings. Why this exact amount? and why such particularity in the reckoning? By turning to <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a> we learn that thirty shekels were the estimated value of a manservant or maidservant; for it is there stated that "if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver." The price paid by the prophet partly in money and partly in kind was exactly the price of an ordinary maidservant. The barley (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, plural, equivalent to "grains of barley") may hint the woman's unchastity, as it was the offering for a woman suspected of adultery (<a href="/numbers/5.htm">Numbers 5</a>.) The low estate of the person purchased is a legitimate inference kern all this. The wife, for whom such a paltry sum should be paid, and paid in such a way, or to whom such a petty gift would be offered, must be supposed to be in a condition of deep depression or in circumstances of great distress. Thus the sum paid by the prophet for his partner symbolizes the servile state of Israel when Jehovah chose them for his peculiar people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Since, from the explanation given by the angel in this verse, the vision relates to the Medo-Persian and the Javanic world-kingdoms, and to the persecuting kingdom of Antiochus which arose out of the latter, so it cannot be disputed that here, in prophetic perspective, the time of the end is seen together with the period of the oppression of the people of God by Antiochus, and the first appearance of the Messiah with His return in glory to the final judgment, as the latter is the case also in <a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>., 44f., and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. If Kliefoth objects: The coming of the Messiah may certainly be conceived of as bound up with the end of all things, and this is done, since both events stand in intimate causal relation to each other, not seldom in those O.T. prophets who yet do not distinguish the times; but they also know well that this intimate causal connection does not include contemporaneousness, that the coming of the Messiah in the flesh will certainly bring about the end of all things, but not as an immediate consequence, but after a somewhat lengthened intervening space, that thus, after the coming of the Messiah, a course of historical events will further unfold themselves before the end comes (which Daniel also knew, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> shows), and where the supposition is this, as in Daniel, there the time before the appearance of Christ in the flesh cannot be called the time of the end: - then the inference drawn in these last passages is not confirmed by the contents of the book of Daniel. For in the last vision (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10-12</a>) which Daniel saw, not only the time of oppression of Antiochus and that of the last enemy are contemplated together as one, but also the whole contents of this one vision are, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>, transferred to the "end of the days;" for the divine messenger says to Daniel, "I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the end of the days, for the vision yet relates to the days." And not only this, but also in <a href="/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a> it is said of the tribulation brought upon the people of God by Antiochus, that in it many would fall, to cleanse them and to purify them to the time of the end, for it is yet for the appointed time. Here, beyond doubt, the time of the persecution by Antiochus is placed in intimate union with the time of the end, but, as is to be particularly observed, not so that the two are spoken of as synchronous. This point is of importance for the right exposition of the verse before us. If, in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>, it is twice said la&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1511;&#1509; &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (the end is yet for the appointed time), and thus does not begin with the oppression of the people of God by Antiochus, so we may not conclude from these verses - and in this Kliefoth is perfectly justified - that Daniel expected the erection of the Messianic kingdom and the end of all history with the overthrow of Antiochus. If, however, on the whole, the intimate causal connection of the two periods of tribulation placed together in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> in one vision neither demands nor even permits us to regard the two as synchronous, so this erroneous conclusion drawn from these verses before us, in connection with an incorrect interpretation of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36-45</a>, is sufficiently obviated, both by <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> and 7, according to which the fourth world-kingdom shall precede the erection of the everlasting kingdom of God and the manifestation of the Son of man, as also by <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, where - as our exposition will show - the coming of the Messiah and the perfecting of the kingdom of God by the overthrow of the last enemy are dependent on one another in point of time - the coming of the Messiah after seven weeks, the perfecting of the kingdom of God will follow, but not trill after the lapse of seventy weeks.<p>This passage is to be understood according to these distinct revelations and statements, and not that because in them, according to prophetic perspective, the oppression of the people of the saints by Antiochus, the little horn, is seen in one vision with the tribulation of the end-time, therefore the synchronism or identity of the two is to be concluded, and the erection of the regnum gloriae and the end of the world to be placed at the destruction of this little horn. The words, "the vision relates to the time of the end," thus only declare that the prophecy has a reference to Messianic times. As to the nature of this reference, the angel gives some intimation when, having touched the prophet, who had fallen in amazement to the ground, he raised him up and enabled him to listen to his words (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>), the intimation that he would make known to him what would happen in the last time of violence (<a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>). &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; is the wrath of God against Israel, the punishment which God hung over them on account of their sins, as in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-17.htm">Jeremiah 25:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-24.htm">Ezekiel 22:24</a>, etc., and here the sufferings of punishment and discipline which the little horn shall bring over Israel. The time of this revelation of divine wrath is called &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; because it belongs to the &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, prepares the Messianic future, and with its conclusion begins the last age of the world, of which, however, nothing more particular is here said, for the prophecy breaks off with the destruction of the little horn. The vision of the eleventh chapter first supplies more particular disclosures on this point. In that chapter the great enemy of the saints of God, arising out of the third world-kingdom, is set forth and represented as the prefiguration or type of their last enemy at the end of the days. Under the words &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (which shall be) the angel understands all that the vision of this chapter contains, from the rising up of the Medo-Persian world-kingdom to the time of the destruction of Antiochus Epiphanes, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-25</a> show. But when he adds &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, he immediately makes prominent that which is the most important matter in the whole vision, the severe oppression which awaits the people of Israel in the future for their purification, and repeats, in justification of that which is said, the conclusion from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, in which he only exchanges &#1506;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is the definite time in its duration; &#1511;&#1509; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; thus denotes the end-time as to its duration. This expression is here chosen with regard to the circumstance that in <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a> the end of the oppression was accurately defined by the declaration of its continuance. The object of these words also is variously viewed by interpreters. The meaning is not that the angel wished to console Daniel with the thought that the judgment of the vision was not yet so near at hand (Zndel); for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, Daniel was not terrified by the contents of the vision, but by the approach of the heavenly being; and if, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>, the words of the angel so increased his terror that he fell down confounded to the earth, and the angel had to raise him by touching him, yet it is not at the same time said that the words of the angel of the end-time had so confounded him, and that the subsequent fuller explanation was somewhat less overwhelming than the words, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, something lighter or more comforting. Even though the statement about the time of the end contributed to the increase of the terror, yet the contents of <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a> were not fitted to raise up the prophet, but the whole discourse of the angel was for Daniel so oppressive that after hearing it, he was for some days sick, <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>. From Daniel's astonishment we are not to conclude that the angel in <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a> spoke of the absolute end of all things, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, on the contrary, of the end of the oppression of the people of Israel by Antiochus. By the words, "the vision relates to the appointed end-time," the angel wished only to point to the importance of his announcement, and to add emphasis to his call to the prophet to give heed.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-26</a><p>After the introductory words, we have now in these verses the explanation of the chief points of the vision.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-22</a> explain <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3-8</a>. "The kings of Media and Persia" are the whole number of the Medo-Persian kings as they succeed each other, i.e., the Medo-Persian monarchy in the whole of its historical development. To &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; the epithet &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, hairy, shaggy, is added to characterize the animal as an he-goat. The king of Javan (Greece) is the founder and representative of the Macedo-Grecian world-kingdom, or rather the royalty of this kingdom, since the great horn of the ram is forthwith interpreted of Alexander the Great, the first king of this kingdom. The words &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; to &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; (<a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a>) form an absolute subject-sentence, in which, however, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is not to be taken &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, it broke in pieces, so that ... (Kran.); for "the statement of the principal passage may not appear here in the subordinate relative passage" (Hitzig); but to the statement beginning with the participle the further definition in the verb. in. with  &#1493;consec. is added, without the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as is frequently the case (cf. Ewald's Lehr. 351), which we cannot give with so much brevity, but must express thus: "as concerning the horn, that it was broken in pieces, and then four stood up in its place, (this signifies) that four kingdoms shall arise from the people." &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; without the article does not signify from the people of Javan, for in this case the article would not have been omitted; nor does it signify from the heathen world, because a direct contrast to Israel does not lie before us; but indefinitely, from the territory of the people, or the world of the people, since the prophecy conceives of the whole world of the people (Vklerwelt) as united under the sceptre of the king of Javan. &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is a revived archaism; cf. <a href="/genesis/30-38.htm">Genesis 30:38</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>; Ewald, 191; Gesen. Gramm. 47. - &#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1495;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, but not in his power, not armed with the strength of the first king, cf. <a href="/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>.</body></html>
