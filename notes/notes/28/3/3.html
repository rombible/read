This was intended, 1st, To be an emblem of the state of the Jews during the Babylonish captivity; when snatched, as it were by force, from the objects of their impure love, they continued in their exile equally separated from their God and their idols; but with this difference, that their God retained toward them sentiments of affection, expecting on their part true repentance. And, 2d, “The condition of the woman, restrained from licentious courses, owned as a wife, but without conjugal rites, admirably represents also the present state of the Jews, manifestly owned as a peculiar people, withheld from idolatry, but as yet without access to God, through the Saviour.” — Horsley.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-3 The dislike of men to true religion is because they love objects and forms, which allow them to indulge, instead of mortifying their lusts.

Here is represented God's gracious dealings with the fallen race of mankind, that had gone from him. This is the covenant of grace he is willing to enter into with them, they must be to him a people, and he will be to them a God.

He does not say "to thee," so as to belong to her, but "toward thee;" i. e., he would have regard, respect to her; he would watch over her, be kindly disposed toward her; he, his affections, interests, thoughts, would be directed "toward" her. The word toward expresses regard, yet distance also.

V.). Gomer is to lead a quiet secluded life; her licentious course is cut short, and her conjugal intercourse may not yet be resumed.

Others, with Aben Ezra and Kimchi, understand, instead of ‘will be’, ‘will not go in’, taking the clause as a contrast to that which precedes (‘but I will not go in unto thee’). Ewald renders, ‘and yet I am kind unto thee’. It is possible that some short word (such as ‘so’ or ‘not’) has dropped out of the text.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shall not be for another man.</span> The prophet imposes certain restrictions of a very stringent character on his wife; he places her in a state of isolation; her past excesses and his purpose of effecting her reformation necessitate such measures, however strict and severe or even harsh they may appear. She is not to be admitted into full fellowship with her husband, nor is she to be allowed the possibility of intercourse with others. From friend, that is, husband and lovers, she is shut out; all sexual connection, whether illicit or legitimate, is peremptorily cut off. The clause, "thou shalt abide [or, 'sit still'] for me," denotes an attitude of waiting, not necessarily in sorrow, like the captive maiden who before marriage with her captor bewailed her parents for the period of a month, but in patient expectation of her husband's fortune and favor, though in seclusion from him, as also exclusion of all others. During this long period of "many days" she is not only debarred the society of her lawful partner, but forbidden either to play the harlot with several or to attach herself to a single paramour. Jerome directs attention to the fact that the word "another" has no place in the original text; otherwise it would imply that she was prohibited from intercourse with any other than her husband, while the real meaning makes the prohibition absolute and inclusive even of conjugal connection with her husband. <span class="cmt_word">So will I also be for thee</span>. The Hebrew expositors, Aben Ezra and Kimchi, repeat the negative flora the preceding clause and translate, "Nor shall I even come to you," that is, for marital society. This is not necessary to bring out the true sense, which is that, as she was to be restrained from intercourse with any and every other man, so he himself also would abstain from intercourse with her. "<span class="accented">And</span> also I will be for [unto] thee [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thy husband] to preserve conjugal fidelity to thee, but hold aloof from thee during thy detention." Thus separated from both lovers and husband, Israel would for many a long day suspend her worship of idols, and be at the same time shut out from her covenant relation to Jehovah. Kimchi's comment mounts to pretty much the same, as does also that of Aben Ezra. The explanation of the former is, "I said to her, After thou hast committed adultery against me, thy punishment shall be that thou shalt abide in widowhood of life many days; and the meaning of 'for me' is, thou shalt be called by my name and not by another man's; thou shalt say, I am the wife of such a one, and thou shelf not play the harlot with others, and also thou shalt not be the wife of any other man than myself." Aben Ezra makes mention of another interpretation of the verse, to the effect, "If ye shall return to me, I also will return to you." With this the Chaldee Targum is in accord, which represents God as commanding the prophet to say, "O congregation of Israel, your sins have been the cause of your exile for many days; ye shall devote yourselves to my service, and not go astray nor worship idols, and I also will have compassion upon you." Maurer considers the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>, viz. <span class="accented">remhabere cum muliere</span>; but to this linguistic usage is opposed. Umbreit renders the phrase, "and I will <span class="accented">only</span> be for thee;" this, however, partakes more of the nature of a promise than of a punishment, and is not quite, therefore, in accord with the context. Ewald: "And yet I am kind to thee [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. love thee];" this is a rather trivial, as also ill-supported idea. Calvin's exposition is pretty much the same as we have given, and is the following: "I also shall be for thee; that is, I pledge my faith to thee, or I subscribe myself as thy husband: but another time must be looked for; I yet defer my favor, and suspend it until thou givest proof of true repentance. I also shall be for thee; that is, thou shalt not be a widow in vain; if thou complainest that wrong is done to thee, because I forbid thee to marry any one else, I also bind myself in turn to thee." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Since, from the explanation given by the angel in this verse, the vision relates to the Medo-Persian and the Javanic world-kingdoms, and to the persecuting kingdom of Antiochus which arose out of the latter, so it cannot be disputed that here, in prophetic perspective, the time of the end is seen together with the period of the oppression of the people of God by Antiochus, and the first appearance of the Messiah with His return in glory to the final judgment, as the latter is the case also in <a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34</a>., 44f., and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. If Kliefoth objects: The coming of the Messiah may certainly be conceived of as bound up with the end of all things, and this is done, since both events stand in intimate causal relation to each other, not seldom in those O.T. prophets who yet do not distinguish the times; but they also know well that this intimate causal connection does not include contemporaneousness, that the coming of the Messiah in the flesh will certainly bring about the end of all things, but not as an immediate consequence, but after a somewhat lengthened intervening space, that thus, after the coming of the Messiah, a course of historical events will further unfold themselves before the end comes (which Daniel also knew, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> shows), and where the supposition is this, as in Daniel, there the time before the appearance of Christ in the flesh cannot be called the time of the end: - then the inference drawn in these last passages is not confirmed by the contents of the book of Daniel. For in the last vision (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10-12</a>) which Daniel saw, not only the time of oppression of Antiochus and that of the last enemy are contemplated together as one, but also the whole contents of this one vision are, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>, transferred to the "end of the days;" for the divine messenger says to Daniel, "I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the end of the days, for the vision yet relates to the days." And not only this, but also in <a href="/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a> it is said of the tribulation brought upon the people of God by Antiochus, that in it many would fall, to cleanse them and to purify them to the time of the end, for it is yet for the appointed time. Here, beyond doubt, the time of the persecution by Antiochus is placed in intimate union with the time of the end, but, as is to be particularly observed, not so that the two are spoken of as synchronous. This point is of importance for the right exposition of the verse before us. If, in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>, it is twice said la&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1511;&#1509; &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (the end is yet for the appointed time), and thus does not begin with the oppression of the people of God by Antiochus, so we may not conclude from these verses - and in this Kliefoth is perfectly justified - that Daniel expected the erection of the Messianic kingdom and the end of all history with the overthrow of Antiochus. If, however, on the whole, the intimate causal connection of the two periods of tribulation placed together in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> in one vision neither demands nor even permits us to regard the two as synchronous, so this erroneous conclusion drawn from these verses before us, in connection with an incorrect interpretation of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36-45</a>, is sufficiently obviated, both by <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> and 7, according to which the fourth world-kingdom shall precede the erection of the everlasting kingdom of God and the manifestation of the Son of man, as also by <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, where - as our exposition will show - the coming of the Messiah and the perfecting of the kingdom of God by the overthrow of the last enemy are dependent on one another in point of time - the coming of the Messiah after seven weeks, the perfecting of the kingdom of God will follow, but not trill after the lapse of seventy weeks.<p>This passage is to be understood according to these distinct revelations and statements, and not that because in them, according to prophetic perspective, the oppression of the people of the saints by Antiochus, the little horn, is seen in one vision with the tribulation of the end-time, therefore the synchronism or identity of the two is to be concluded, and the erection of the regnum gloriae and the end of the world to be placed at the destruction of this little horn. The words, "the vision relates to the time of the end," thus only declare that the prophecy has a reference to Messianic times. As to the nature of this reference, the angel gives some intimation when, having touched the prophet, who had fallen in amazement to the ground, he raised him up and enabled him to listen to his words (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>), the intimation that he would make known to him what would happen in the last time of violence (<a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>). &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; is the wrath of God against Israel, the punishment which God hung over them on account of their sins, as in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-17.htm">Jeremiah 25:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-24.htm">Ezekiel 22:24</a>, etc., and here the sufferings of punishment and discipline which the little horn shall bring over Israel. The time of this revelation of divine wrath is called &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; because it belongs to the &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, prepares the Messianic future, and with its conclusion begins the last age of the world, of which, however, nothing more particular is here said, for the prophecy breaks off with the destruction of the little horn. The vision of the eleventh chapter first supplies more particular disclosures on this point. In that chapter the great enemy of the saints of God, arising out of the third world-kingdom, is set forth and represented as the prefiguration or type of their last enemy at the end of the days. Under the words &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (which shall be) the angel understands all that the vision of this chapter contains, from the rising up of the Medo-Persian world-kingdom to the time of the destruction of Antiochus Epiphanes, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-25</a> show. But when he adds &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, he immediately makes prominent that which is the most important matter in the whole vision, the severe oppression which awaits the people of Israel in the future for their purification, and repeats, in justification of that which is said, the conclusion from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, in which he only exchanges &#1506;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is the definite time in its duration; &#1511;&#1509; &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; thus denotes the end-time as to its duration. This expression is here chosen with regard to the circumstance that in <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a> the end of the oppression was accurately defined by the declaration of its continuance. The object of these words also is variously viewed by interpreters. The meaning is not that the angel wished to console Daniel with the thought that the judgment of the vision was not yet so near at hand (Zndel); for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, Daniel was not terrified by the contents of the vision, but by the approach of the heavenly being; and if, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>, the words of the angel so increased his terror that he fell down confounded to the earth, and the angel had to raise him by touching him, yet it is not at the same time said that the words of the angel of the end-time had so confounded him, and that the subsequent fuller explanation was somewhat less overwhelming than the words, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, something lighter or more comforting. Even though the statement about the time of the end contributed to the increase of the terror, yet the contents of <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a> were not fitted to raise up the prophet, but the whole discourse of the angel was for Daniel so oppressive that after hearing it, he was for some days sick, <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>. From Daniel's astonishment we are not to conclude that the angel in <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a> spoke of the absolute end of all things, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, on the contrary, of the end of the oppression of the people of Israel by Antiochus. By the words, "the vision relates to the appointed end-time," the angel wished only to point to the importance of his announcement, and to add emphasis to his call to the prophet to give heed.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-26</a><p>After the introductory words, we have now in these verses the explanation of the chief points of the vision.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20-22</a> explain <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3-8</a>. "The kings of Media and Persia" are the whole number of the Medo-Persian kings as they succeed each other, i.e., the Medo-Persian monarchy in the whole of its historical development. To &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512; the epithet &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, hairy, shaggy, is added to characterize the animal as an he-goat. The king of Javan (Greece) is the founder and representative of the Macedo-Grecian world-kingdom, or rather the royalty of this kingdom, since the great horn of the ram is forthwith interpreted of Alexander the Great, the first king of this kingdom. The words &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; to &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; (<a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a>) form an absolute subject-sentence, in which, however, &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is not to be taken &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, it broke in pieces, so that ... (Kran.); for "the statement of the principal passage may not appear here in the subordinate relative passage" (Hitzig); but to the statement beginning with the participle the further definition in the verb. in. with  &#1493;consec. is added, without the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as is frequently the case (cf. Ewald's Lehr. 351), which we cannot give with so much brevity, but must express thus: "as concerning the horn, that it was broken in pieces, and then four stood up in its place, (this signifies) that four kingdoms shall arise from the people." &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; without the article does not signify from the people of Javan, for in this case the article would not have been omitted; nor does it signify from the heathen world, because a direct contrast to Israel does not lie before us; but indefinitely, from the territory of the people, or the world of the people, since the prophecy conceives of the whole world of the people (Vklerwelt) as united under the sceptre of the king of Javan. &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; is a revived archaism; cf. <a href="/genesis/30-38.htm">Genesis 30:38</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>; Ewald, 191; Gesen. Gramm. 47. - &#1489;&#1499;&#1493;&#1495;&#1493; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, but not in his power, not armed with the strength of the first king, cf. <a href="/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>.</body></html>
