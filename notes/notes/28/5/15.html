The image of the lion is dropped. Jehovah speaks of “His own place”—Heaven.

The Chaldee paraphrase expresses the sense thus: “I will take away my majestic presence, or shechinah, from among them, and will return into heaven.” Thus Ezekiel describes the destruction of the temple and kingdom, by God’s removing his glory from the sanctuary and city: see <a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm" title="Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.">Ezekiel 10:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.">Ezekiel 11:23</a>. <span class="ital">In their affliction they will seek me early — </span>That is, without delay, and earnestly; or, with great diligence and assiduity. Observe, reader, when we are under the corrections of the divine rod, our business is to seek God’s face, that is, an acquaintance with him, a token of his being at peace with us, and a manifestation of his favour. And it may reasonably be expected that affliction will bring those to God who had gone astray, and kept at a distance from him. For this reason God turns away from us, that he may turn us to himself, and then may return to us. <span class="ital">Is any among you afflicted? </span>Let him pray.

And it is a mercy that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from the wrath to come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart the commandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God are sometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as a worm; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgments of God consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe and thriving, but when they look into their state, shall find themselves wasting and decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent. Many a nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption. Gradually, God comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to prevent greater, if they will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judah found themselves in danger, they sought the protection of the Assyrians, but this only helped to make their wound the worse. They would be forced to apply to God. He will bring them home to himself, by afflictions. When men begin to complain more of their sins than of their afflictions, then there begins to be some hope of them; and when under the conviction of sin, and the corrections of the rod, we must seek the knowledge of God. Those who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will go and return to My place - As the wild beast, when he has taken his prey, returns to his covert, so God, when He had fulfilled His will, would, for the time, withdraw all tokens of his presence. God, who is wholly everywhere, is said to dwell "there," relatively to us, where he manifests Himself, as of old, in the tabernacle, the temple, Zion, Jerusalem. He is said to "go and return," when He withdraws all tokens of His presence, His help, care, and providence. This is worse than any affliction on God's part , "a state like theirs who, in the lowest part of hell, are "delivered into chains of darkness," shut out from His presence, and so from all hope of comfort; and this must needs be their condition, so long as He shall be absent from them; and so perpetually, except there be a way for obtaining again His favorable presence."<p>Till they acknowledge their offence - o: "He who "hath no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live," withdraws Himself from them, not to cast them off altogether, but that they might know and acknowledge their folly and wickedness, and, seeing there is no comfort out of Him, prefer His presence to those vain things." which they had preferred to Him To say, that God would hide His Face from them, "until they should acknowledge their offence," holds out in itself a gleam of hope, that hereafter they would turn to Him, and would find Him.<p>And seek My Face - The first step in repentance is confession of sin; the second, turning to God. For to own sin without turning to God is the despair of Judas.<p>In their affliction they shall seek Me early - God does not only leave them hopes, that He would show forth his presence, when they sought him, but He promises that they shah seek Him, i. e. He would give them His grace whereby alone they could seek Him, and that grace should be effectual. Of itself affliction drives to despair and more obdurate rebellion and final impenitence. Through the grace of God, "evil brings forth good; fear, love; chastisement, repentance." "They shall seek Me early," originally, "in the morning," i. e., with all diligence and earnestness, as a man riseth early to do what he is very much set upon. So these shall "shake off the sleep of sin and the torpor of listlessness, when the light of repentance shall shine upon them."<p>This was fulfilled in the two tribes, toward the end of the seventy years, when many doubtless, together with Daniel, "set their face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and ashes" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2-3</a>; and again in, those "who waited for redemption in Jerusalem" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-38.htm">Luke 2:38</a>, when our Lord came; and it will be fulfillment in all at the end of the world. "The first flash of thought on the power and goodness of the true Deliverer, is like the morning streaks of a new day. At the sight of that light, Israel shall arise early to seek his God; he shall rise quickly like the Prodigal, out of his wanderings and his indigence." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. return to my place&#8212;that is, withdraw My favor.<p>till they acknowledge their offence&#8212;The Hebrew is, "till they suffer the penalty of their guilt."

The &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; after &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; does not serve to designate the three weeks as common day-weeks, in contrast to the &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; of <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>., but is an accusative subordinated to the definition of time which expresses the idea of continuance: three weeks long, or three whole weeks, as <a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>; cf. Gesen. Gramm. 118, 3. For three weeks Daniel mourned and fasted, i.e., abstained from the usual food. &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, precious food, delicacies; but Hv., v. Leng., Maur., Hitz., and Kran. interpret it of leavened bread, so called in contrast to the unleavened paschal bread, the bread of affliction (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>). But this contrast is not well founded, for the &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (unleavened cakes) of the passover was not (notwithstanding <a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>) bread of sorrow, but pure, holy bread, which Daniel did not eat, in opposition to the law, for three weeks. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; is not to be limited to bread in its narrower sense, but denotes food generally. Flesh and wine are festival food, <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-25.htm">Genesis 27:25</a>, which is not had every day. The anointing with oil was the sign of joy and of a joyous frame of mind, as with guests at a banquet, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, and was intermitted in the time of sorrow; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>. Fasting, as an abstaining from the better sustenance of common life, was the outward sign of sorrow of soul.<p>According to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>, Daniel mourned and fasted in the first month of the year, the month in the middle of which the paschal feast was kept, in which Israel celebrated their deliverance from their state of slavery in Egypt and their advancement to be the people of God, and were joyful before their God. On the 24th day of this month occurred the Theophany (<a href="/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a>.), with which, however, his fasting came to an end. According to this, it appears that he fasted from the third to the twenty-third of the month Nisan; thus it began immediately after the feast of the new moon, which was kept for two days (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-18.htm">1 Samuel 20:18</a>., 27, 34 with 6:29; <a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>). Thus Hv. and Hitzig conclude; while v. Leng. and Maurer argue, from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, that between the time of fasting and the appearance of the angel an interval elapsed, consequently that Daniel fasted from the first to the twenty-first of the month Nisan. But from <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> nothing further follows than that the angel was detained twenty-one days; so that the question as to the beginning and the end of the fast is not certainly answered from the text, and, as being irrelevant to the matter, it can remain undecided. More important is the question as to the cause of such long-continued great sorrow, which is not answered by the remark that he was thus prepared for receiving a divine revelation. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>, Daniel sought &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., understanding as to the state of the matter, or regarding the future of his people, which filled him with concern. The word about the restoration of Jerusalem which he had received through the angel Gabriel in the first year of Darius (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>) had come to pass since that revelation in the first year of Cyrus, but had had only little effect on the religious lukewarmness of the majority of the people. Of the whole people only a very small portion had returned to the land of their fathers, and had begun, after restoring the altar of burnt-offering, to build the house of God in Jerusalem. But while the foundation of the new temple was laid, there mingled with the joyful shoutings of the people also the loud wailings of the old men who had seen the former temple in its glory, when they beheld this building undertaken amid circumstances so depressing and sorrowful (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1-13</a>). In addition to this, the Samaritans immediately, when the Jewish rulers refused for conscience sake to permit them to take part with them in the building, sought, by means of influences used at the Persian court, to prevent the carrying on of the building (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1-5</a>). This sad state of matters could not but, at the beginning of the new year, fill the heart of Daniel with deep sorrow, and move him at the return of the time of the passover to mourn in fasting and prayer over the delay of the salvation promised to his people, and to supplicate in behalf of Israel the pardon of their sins, and their deliverance out of the hand of their enemies. Therefore he mourned and fasted before and during the paschal days for three weeks, until on the twenty-fourth day of the month he received a revelation from God. </body></html>
