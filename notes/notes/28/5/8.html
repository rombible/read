And it is a mercy that we have timely warning given us, that we may flee from the wrath to come. Compliance with the commandments of men, who thwart the commandments of God, ripens a people for ruin. The judgments of God are sometimes to a sinful people as a moth, and as rottenness, or as a worm; as these consume the clothes and the wood, so shall the judgments of God consume them. Silently, they shall think themselves safe and thriving, but when they look into their state, shall find themselves wasting and decaying. Slowly, for the Lord gives them space to repent. Many a nation; as well as many a person, dies of a consumption. Gradually, God comes upon sinners with lesser judgments, to prevent greater, if they will be wise, and take warning. When Israel and Judah found themselves in danger, they sought the protection of the Assyrians, but this only helped to make their wound the worse. They would be forced to apply to God. He will bring them home to himself, by afflictions. When men begin to complain more of their sins than of their afflictions, then there begins to be some hope of them; and when under the conviction of sin, and the corrections of the rod, we must seek the knowledge of God. Those who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah - The evil day and destruction, denounced, is now vividly pictured, as actually come. All is in confusion, hurry, alarm, because the enemy was in the midst of them. The "cornet," an instrument made of horn, was to be blown as the alarm, when the enemy was at hand. The "trumpet" was especially used for the worship of God. "Gibeah and Ramah" were cities of Benjamin, on the borders of Ephraim, where the enemy, who had possessed himself of Israel, would burst in upon Judah. From Bethaven or Bethel, the seat of Ephraim's idolatry, on the border of Benjamin, was to break forth the outcry of destruction, "after thee, O Benjamin;" the enemy is upon thee, just behind thee, pursuing thee. God had promised His people, if they would serve Him, "I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee" <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>, and had threatened the contrary, if they should "walk contrary to Him." Now that threat was to be fulfilled to the uttermost. The ten tribes are spoken of, as already in possession of the enemy, and he was "upon Benjamin" fleeing before them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The "trumpet" was of brass or silver, straight, and used in wars and on solemn occasions.

"Cry aloud," namely, to raise the alarm. "Benjamin" is put for the whole southern kingdom of Judah (compare Ho 5:5), being the first part of it which would meet the foe advancing from the north. "After thee, O Benjamin," implies the position of Beth-aven, behind Benjamin, at the borders of Ephraim. When the foe is at Beth-aven, he is at Benjamin's rear, close upon thee, O Benjamin (Jud 5:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hosea/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Blow ye the cornet; </span> ye watchmen, or whoever have the care and custody of these fortified towns, sound the alarm, for the enemy cometh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In Gibeah; </span> a town of Benjamin situate on a hill, built by Asa, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/15-22.htm" title="Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.">1 Kings 15:22</a></span>; made by him a frontier, and likely always garrisoned against the incursion of the ten tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And the trumpet; </span> add to the sound of the cornet the trumpet also, which is proper for war, and will be best understood by the people; lest they mistake the meaning of the cornet, which is, say some, a pastoral instrument, proper for shepherds, sound the trumpet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In Ramah; </span> of which there were three, one in Naphtali, and Rama-sophim, and this of Benjamin near Gibeah, and was an inlet into Judah, of great importance, as appears <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm" title="And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">1 Kings 15:17</a>,21</span>; a town of strength, built on a high hill, and fit to be as a watchtower.

As an alarm of war, to give notice that the enemy is at hand, just ready to invade the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and bring destruction upon them; according to the Targum, the words are directed to the prophets, <p>"O ye prophets, lift up your voice like a trumpet;'' <p>to declare to the people of Judah their sins and transgressions, and the punishment that would be inflicted on them for them; or it may be, this is a call of the people to fasting, mounting, and lamentation, as in <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>. Gibeah is the same which is called "Gibeah of Saul", <a href="/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>; it being the birth place of that prince; and which Josephus (i) calls Gabathsaoule, and interprets it the hill of Saul, and says it was distant from Jerusalem about four miles; though elsewhere (k) he represents it as but two and a half miles; perhaps in the latter place there is a corruption in the number; for, according to Jerom, it was near Ramah, which was seven miles from Jerusalem; he says it is called also "Gibeah of Benjamin", <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>; because it was in that tribe, as was also Ramah; which, according to Eusebius (l), was six miles from Jerusalem; these were near to each other; see <a href="/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a>; so that the calamity threatened is what respects the two tribes: <p>cry aloud at Bethaven; the same with Bethel, or a place near unto it, in the tribe of Benjamin, or on the borders of Ephraim; see <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>. According to the above writer (m), it lay about twelve miles from Jerusalem; in the way to Sichem; and being upon the borders both of Benjamin and Ephraim, it sometimes belonged to Israel, and sometimes to Judah; see <a href="/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>; and seeing, as Jerom observes, that Benjamin was at the back of it (for where the tribe of Benjamin ended, not far in the tribe of Ephraim, according to him, was this city built), it therefore very beautifully follows, <p>after thee, O Benjamin; that is, either the enemy is after thee, O Benjamin, is just at hand, ready to fall upon thee, and destroy thee, as Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech; or rather, after the trumpet is blown in Gibeah and Ramah, cities which belonged to Benjamin, let it he blown, either in Bethaven, on the borders of Benjamin and Ephraim; or let it be blown in the tribe of Judah, so that all the twelve tribes may have notice, and prepare for what is coming upon them. <p>(i) De Bello Jud. l. 5. c. 2. sect. 1.((k) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 2. sect. 8.

Previously to the captivity the cornet and the trumpet were probably different names for the same instrument, as the Law (<a href="/context/numbers/10-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 10:1-10</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-6.htm" title="And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.">Numbers 31:6</a>) prescribes the use of the silver trumpet (<span class="ital">khaçôçerah</span>) in cases when, according to the prophetic and historical books, the cornet or <span class="ital">shôfâr</span> was used.

The Mishna tells us that the <span class="ital">shôfâr</span> was sometimes straight, sometimes curved, and this difference would of course involve a difference of note. We may help ourselves to form an idea of the Hebrew trumpets by representations of the Egyptian (see Wilkinson, <span class="ital">Manners and Customs</span>, 11. 260, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Gibeah … Ramah</span>] Both towns were situated on eminences, and therefore well adapted for signals of alarm; both apparently belonged to Judah. Gibeah (lit. ‘a hill’) is ‘Gibeah of Benjamin’ (<a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm" title="Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.">1 Samuel 13:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-16.htm" title="And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.">1 Samuel 14:16</a>), or ‘Gibeah of Saul’ (<a href="/1_samuel/11-4.htm" title="Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.">1 Samuel 11:4</a>); the Ramah (lit. ‘height’) is the same where Samuel dwelt (<a href="/1_samuel/15-34.htm" title="Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.">1 Samuel 15:34</a>). Both probably belonged at this time to Judah (see <a href="/1_kings/15-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelled in Tirzah.">1 Kings 15:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-29.htm" title="They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.">Isaiah 10:29</a>). Taking in Bethel, the cities are those from which the signal of alarm could be heard in both kingdoms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after thee, O Benjamin</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">behind thee, O Benjamin;</span> this is the cry of warning which the men of Beth-aven or Bethel (a border-town between Benjamin and Ephraim) are to send on to the Benjamites. Understand either ‘the sword rages’, or more simply ‘be on thy guard.’ Sept. however renders (from a different text?), <span class="greekheb">ἐξέστη Βενιαμίν</span>, ‘Benjamin is distraught.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is worth noticing that Hosea (the prophet of the tribes which proudly claimed the name of Israel) does not mention Jerusalem. To have mentioned the capital of Judah would perhaps have led him to widen his range of thought too much. But under the name ‘Benjamin’ he has been thought to hint obscurely at Jerusalem, for ‘the boundary between Judah and Benjamin ran at the foot of the hill on which the city stands, so that the city itself was actually in Benjamin’ (Fergusson, in Smith’s <span class="ital">Bible-Dictionary</span>, 1. 983).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8–15</span>. The prophet ‘in the spirit’ sees the threatened trouble bursting upon both the separated kingdoms. In vain will Ephraim seek help from Assyria; there is no deliverance from Jehovah’s hand until Ephraim repents.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah.</span> Intimation had been given in the preceding verse that the period of their fast-approaching destruction was at hand; that, as Kimchi expresses it, the now moon would soon come at which their enemies would destroy them. Now he pictures them as already on the march, and just advancing to execute the work of destruction; while the terror and alarm consequent thereon are here presented with great vividness, but at the same time with much brevity. A similar scene is depicted at full length by <a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>, where the line of the Assyrians' march seems to be indicated, if, indeed, it be not a poetic representation of it, which the prophet gives. Thus from Aiath (<span class="accented">el-Tell</span>) to the pass of Michmash, now <span class="accented">Mukmas</span>, where he lays up his baggage; forward to Gobs, where they quarter for the night; then on to Nob, where he halts in sight at the holy city, and scarce an hour's march distant. The alarm was to be sounded with the <span class="accented">shophar</span>, or far-sounding cornet, made of curved horn, and the <span class="accented">chatsotserah</span>, or straight trumpet, made of brass or silver, used in war or at festivals. This signal of hostile invasion was to he sounded in Gibeah, now <span class="accented">Tuleil-el-Ful</span>, some four miles north of Jerusalem, and in Ramah, now <span class="accented">er-Ram</span>, two miles further distant. Both these towns, situated on eminences, as the names denote, belong to the northern boundary of Benjamin. The overthrow of the northern kingdom is rims presented as an already accomplished fact; while the invading host has already reached the frontier of the southern kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Cry aloud at Beth-avon, after thee, O Benjamin.</span> This cry is the sound at' the war-signals already mentioned, and the repetition intensifies the nature of the alarm and the urgency of the case. Beth-avon was either Bethel, now <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, on the border of Benjamin, or a town nearer Michmash, belonging to Benjamin. The meaning of the somewhat obscure words in the concluding clause can give little trouble, when read in the light of the context. The sounding of the alarm of war indicates with tolerable plainness what was coming behind Benjamin; nor is there need to supply the words, "the enemy rises behind thee," with same, or" the sword rages behind thee," with others. The signals announce the foe as arrived at the frontier of Judah. The enemy is close behind thee, Benjamin, in close pursuit after thee, upon thy very heels. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke.</span> The day of rebuke is the season when God rebukes sin by punishment; the punishment in this case is no slight rebuke or temporary chastisement. On the contrary, it is extreme in severity and final in duration. Famine, or pestilence, or war might lay a country desolate for a time, and yet relief might soon ensue and recuperative power be vigorously developed. Not so here. Ephraim is made more than desolate partially and for a short period; it becomes a desolation - "an entire desolation," as the words literally mean. In this desolation the other tribes would be involved. Nor was the menace lightly to be regarded or treated as meaningless; it was firm - well grounded as the word of the Eternal, and irreversible as his decree. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The divine revelation regarding the seventy weeks. - This message of the angel relates to the most important revelations regarding the future development of the kingdom of God. From the brevity and measured form of the expression, which Auberlen designates "the lapidary style of the upper sanctuary," and from the difficulty of calculating the period named, this verse has been very variously interpreted. The interpretations may be divided into three principal classes. 1. Most of the church fathers and the older orthodox interpreters find prophesied here the appearance of Christ in the flesh, His death, and the destruction of Jerusalem by the <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. The majority of the modern interpreters, on the other hand, refer the whole passage to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. 3. Finally, some of the church fathers and several modern theologians have interpreted the prophecy eschatologically, as an announcement of the development of the kingdom of God from the end of the Exile on to the perfecting of the kingdom by the second coming of Christ at the end of the days.<p>(Note: The first of these views is in our time fully and at length defended by Hvernick (Comm.), Hengstenberg (Christol. iii. 1, p. 19ff., 2nd ed.), and Auberlen (Der Proph.

The second view presents itself in the Alexandrine translation of the prophecy, more distinctly in Julius Hilarianus (about a.d. 400) (Chronologia s. libellus de mundi duratione, in Migne's Biblioth. cler. univ. t. 13, 1098), and in several rabbinical interpreters, but was first brought into special notice by the rationalistic interpreters Eichhorn, Bertholdt. v. Leng., Maurer, Ewald, Hitzig, and the mediating theologians Bleek, Wieseler (Die 70 Wochen u. die 63 Jahrwochen des Proph. Daniel, Gtt. 1839, with which compare the Retractation in the Gttinger gel. Anzeigen, 1846, p. 113ff.), who are followed by Lcke, Hilgenfeld, Kranichfeld, and others. This view has also been defended by Hofmann (die 70 Jahre des Jer. u. die 70 Jahrwochen des Daniel, Nrnb. 1836, and Weissag. u. Erfllung, as also in the Schriftbew.), Delitzsch (Art. Daniel in Herz.'s Realenc. Bd. iii.), and Zndel (in the Kritischen Uterss.), but with this essential modification, that Hofmann and Delitzsch have united an eschatological reference with the primary historical reference of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-27</a> to Antiochus Epiphanes, in consequence of which the prophecy will be perfectly accomplished only in the appearance of Antichrist and the final completion of the kingdom of God at the end of the days. Of the third view we have the first germs in Hoppolytus and Apollinaris of Laodicea, who, having regard to the prophecy of Antichrist, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>, refer the statement of <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a> of this chapter, regarding the last week, to the end of the world; and the first half of this week they regard as the time of the return of Elias, the second half as the time of Antichrist. This view is for the first time definitely stated in the Berleburg Bible. But Kliefoth, in his Comm. on Daniel, was the first who sought to investigate and establish this opinion exegetically, and Leyrer (in Herz.'s Realenc. xviii. p. 383) has thus briefly stated it: - "The seventy &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>.) measured by sevens, within which the whole of God's plan of salvation in the world will be completed, are a symbolical period with reference to the seventy years of exile prophesied by Jeremiah, and with the accessory notion of oecumenicity. The 70 is again divided into three periods: into 7 (till Christ), 62 (till the apostasy of Antichrist), and one &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, the last world - &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, divided into 2 x 3 1/2 times, the rise and the fall of Antichrist."<p>For the history of the interpretation, compare for the patristic period the treatise of Professor Reusch of Bonn, entitled "Die Patrist. Berechnung der 70 Jahrwochen Daniels," in the Tb. Theol. Quart. 1868, p. 535ff.; for the period of the middle ages and of more modern times, Abr. Calovii &#x395;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; theologica de septuaginta septimanis Danielis, in the Biblia illustr. ad Daniel. ix., and Hvernick's History of the Interpretation in his Comm. p. 386ff.; and for the most recent period, R. Baxmann on the Book of Daniel in the Theolog. Studien u. Kritiken, 1863, iii. p. 497ff.)<p>In the great multiplicity of opinions, in order to give clearness to the interpretation, we shall endeavour first of all to ascertain the meaning of the words of each clause and verse, and then, after determining exegetically the import of the words, take into consideration the historical references and calculations of the periods of time named, and thus further to establish our view.<p>The revelation begins, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>, with a general exhibition of the divine counsel regarding the city and the people of God; and then there follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-27</a>, the further unfolding of the execution of this counsel in its principal parts. On this all interpreters are agreed, that the seventy weeks which are determined upon the people and the city are in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-27</a> divided into three periods, and are closely defined according to their duration and their contents. <p>Seventy weeks are determined. - &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, properly, the time divided into sevenths, signifies commonly the period of seven days, the week, as <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>. (in the sing.), and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>, in the plur., which is usually in the form &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>, etc. In the form &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; there thus lies no intimation that it is not common weeks that are meant. As little does it lie in the numeral being placed after it, for it also sometimes is found before it, where, as here, the noun as the weightier idea must be emphasized, and that not by later authors merely, but also in <a href="/genesis/32-15.htm">Genesis 32:15</a>., <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>; cf. Gesen. Lehrgeb. p. 698. What period of time is here denoted by &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; can be determined neither from the word itself and its form, nor from the comparison with &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>, since &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is in these verses added to &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, not for the purpose of designating these as day-weeks, but simply as full weeks (three weeks long). The reasons for the opinion that common (i.e., seven-day) weeks are not intended, lie partly in the contents of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, which undoubtedly teach that that which came to pass in the sixty-two weeks and in the one week could not take place in common weeks, partly in the reference of the seventy &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; to the seventy years of Jeremiah, <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>. According to a prophecy of Jeremiah - so e.g., Hitzig reasons - Jerusalem must lie desolate for seventy years, and now, in the sixty-ninth year, the city and the temple are as yet lying waste (<a href="/daniel/9-17.htm">Daniel 9:17</a>.), and as yet nowhere are there symptoms of any change. Then, in answer to his supplication, Daniel received the answer, seventy &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; must pass before the full working out of the deliverance. "If the deliverance was not yet in seventy years, then still less was it in seventy weeks. With seventy times seven months we are also still inside of seventy years, and we are directed therefore to year-weeks, so that each week shall consist of seven years. The special account of the contents of the weeks can be adjusted with the year-weeks alone; and the half-week, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, particularly appears to be identical in actual time with these three and a half times (years), <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>." This latter element is by others much more definitely affirmed. Thus e.g., Kranichfeld says that Daniel had no doubt about the definite extent of the expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, but gave an altogether unambiguous interpretation of it when he combined the last half-week essentially with the known and definite three and a half years of the time of the end. But - we must, on the contrary, ask - where does Daniel speak of the three and a half years of the time of the end? He does not use the word year in any of the passages that fall to be here considered, but only &#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; or &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, time, definite time. That by this word common years are to be understood, is indeed taken for granted by many interpreters, but a satisfactory proof of such a meaning has not been adduced. Moreover, in favour of year-weeks (periods of seven years) it has been argued that such an interpretation was very natural, since they hold so prominent a place in the law of Moses; and the Exile had brought them anew very distinctly into remembrance, inasmuch as the seventy years' desolation of the land was viewed as a punishment for the interrupted festival of the sabbatical years: <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a> (Hgstb., Kran., and others). But since these periods of seven years, as Hengstenberg himself confesses, are not called in the law &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, therefore, from the repeated designation of the seventh year as that of the great Sabbath merely (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-4.htm">Leviticus 25:4-5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34-35</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), the idea of year-weeks in no way follows. The law makes mention not only of the Sabbath-year, but also of periods of seven times seven years, after the expiry of which a year of jubilee was always to be celebrated (<a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8</a>.). These, as well as the Sabbath-years, might be called &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;. Thus the idea of year-weeks has no exegetical foundation. Hofmann and Kliefoth are in the right when they remark that &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; does not necessarily mean year-weeks, but an intentionally indefinite designation of a period of time measured by the number seven, whose chronological duration must be determined on other grounds. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1495;&#1514;&#1498; means in Chald. to cut off, to cut up into pieces, then to decide, to determine closely, e.g., Targ. <a href="/esther/4-5.htm">Esther 4:5</a>; cf. Buxtorf, Lex. talm., and Levy, Chald. Wrterb. s.v. The meaning for &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, abbreviatae sunt (Vulg. for &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, <a href="/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>), which Wieseler has brought forward, is not proved, and it is unsuitable, because if one cuts off a piece from a whole, the whole is diminished on account of the piece cut off, but not the piece itself. For the explanation of the sing. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; we need neither the supposition that a definite noun, as &#1506;&#1514; (time), was before the prophet's mind (Hgstb.), nor the appeal to the inexact manner of writing of the later authors (Ewald). The sing. is simply explained by this, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is conceived of as the absolute idea, and then is taken up by the passive verb impersonal, to mark that the seventy sevenths are to be viewed as a whole, as a continued period of seventy seven times following each other.<p>Upon thy people and upon thy holy city. In the &#1506;&#1500; there does not lie the conception of that which is burdensome, or that this period would be a time of suffering like the seventy years of exile (v. Lengerke). The word only indicates that such a period of time was determined upon the people. The people and the city of Daniel are called the people and the city of God, because Daniel has just represented them before God as His (Hvernick, v. Lengerke, Kliefoth). But Jerusalem, even when in ruins, is called the holy city by virtue of its past and its future history; cf. <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>. This predicate does not point, as Wieseler and Hitzig have rightly acknowledged, to a time when the temple stood, as Sthelin and v. Lengerke suppose. Only this lies in it, Kliefoth has justly added, - not, however, in the predicate of holiness, but rather in the whole expression, - that the people and city of God shall not remain in the state of desolation in which they then were, but shall at some time be again restored, and shall continue during the time mentioned. One must not, however, at once conclude that this promise of continuance referred only to the people of the Jews and their earthly Jerusalem. Certainly it refers first to Israel after the flesh, and to the geographical Jerusalem, because these were then the people and the city of God; but these ideas are not exhausted in this reference, but at the same time embrace the New Testament church and the church of God on earth.<p>The following infinitive clauses present the object for which the seventy weeks are determined, i.e., they intimate what shall happen till, or with the expiry of, the time determined. Although &#1500; before the infinitive does not mean till or during, yet it is also not correct to say that &#1500; can point out only the issue which the period of time finally reaches, only its result. Whether that which is stated in the infinitive clauses shall for the first time take place after the expiry of, or at the end of the time named, or shall develope itself gradually in the course of it, and only be completed at the end of it, cannot be concluded from the final &#1500;, but only from the material contents of the final clauses. The six statements are divided by Maurer, Hitzig, Kranichfeld, and others into three passages of two members each, thus: After the expiry of seventy weeks, there shall (1) be completed the measure of sin; (2) the sin shall be covered and righteousness brought in; (3) the prophecy shall be fulfilled, and the temple, which was desecrated by Antiochus, shall be again consecrated. The masoretes seem, however, to have already conceived of this threefold division by placing the Atnach under &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (the fourth clause); but it rests on a false construction of the individual members especially of the first two passages. Rather we have two three-membered sentences before us. This appears evident from the arrangement of the six statements; i.e., that the first three statements treat of the taking away of sin, and thus of the negative side of the deliverance; the three last treat of the bringing in of everlasting righteousness with its consequences, and thus of the positive deliverance, and in such a manner that in both classes the three members stand in reciprocal relation to each other: the fourth statement corresponds to the first, the fifth to the second, the sixth to the third - the second and the fifth present even the same verb &#1495;&#1514;&#1501;.<p>In the first and second statements the reading is doubtful. Instead of &#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; (Keth.), to seal, the Keri has &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1501;, to end (R. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, to complete). In &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; a double reading is combined, for the vowel-points do not belong to the Keth., which rather has &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1488;, since &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; is nowhere found in the Piel, but to the Keri, for the Masoretes hold &#1499;&#1500;&#1488; to be of the same meaning as &#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, to be ended. Thus the ancient translators interpreted it: lxx, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; Theod., &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, al. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; Aquil., &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;; Vulg., ut consummetur praevaricatio. Bertholdt, Rosenmller, Gesenius, Winer, Ewald, Hitzig, Maurer, have followed them in supposing a passing of  &#1492;into .&#1488; But since &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; occurs frequently in Daniel, always with  &#1492; htiw(cf. v. 27; <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>), and generally the roots with  &#1492;take the form of those with  &#1488;much seldomer than the reverse, on these grounds the reading &#1500;&#1499;&#1500;&#1488; thus deserves the preference, apart from the consideration that almost all the Keris are valueless emendations of the Masoretes; and the parallel &#1500;&#1492;&#1514;&#1501;, decidedly erroneous, is obviously derived from <a href="/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>. Thus the Keri does not give in the two passages a suitable meaning. The explanation: to finish the transgression and to make full the measure of sin, does not accord with what follows: to pardon the iniquity; and the thought that the Jews would fill up the measure of their transgression in the seventy year-weeks, and that as a punishment they would pass through a period of suffering from Antiochus and afterwards be pardoned, is untenable, because the punishment by Antiochus for their sins brought to their full measure is arbitrarily interpolated; but without this interpolation the pardon of the sins stands in contradiction to the filling up of their measure. Besides, this explanation is further opposed by the fact, that in the first two statements there must be a different subject from that which is in the third. For to fill up the measure of sin is the work of God. Accordingly the Kethiv alone is to be adopted as correct, and the first passage to be translated thus: to shut up the transgression. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; means to hold back, to hold in, to arrest, to hold in prison, to shut in or shut up; hence&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, a prison, jail. To arrest the wickedness or shut it up does not mean to pardon it, but to hem it in, to hinder it so that it can no longer spread about (Hofm.); cf. <a href="/zechariah/5-8.htm">Zechariah 5:8</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>.<p>In the second passage, "to seal up sin," the &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; are the several proofs of the transgression. &#1495;&#1514;&#1501;, to seal, does not denote the finishing or ending of the sins (Theodrt. and others). Like the Arab. chtm, it may occur in the sense of "to end," and this meaning may have originated from the circumstance that one is wont at the end of a letter or document to affix the impress of a seal; yet this meaning is nowhere found in Hebr.: see under <a href="/exodus/28-12.htm">Exodus 28:12</a>. The figure of the sealing stands here in connection with the shutting up in prison. Cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-18.htm">Daniel 6:18</a>, the king for greater security sealed up the den into which Daniel was cast. Thus also God seals the hand of man that it cannot move, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/37-7.htm">Job 37:7</a>, and the stars that they cannot give light, <a href="/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a>. But in this figure to seal is not  equals  to take away, according to which Hgstb. and many others explain it thus: the sins are here described as sealed, because they are altogether removed out of the sight of God, altogether set aside; for "that which is shut up and sealed is not merely taken away, entirely set aside, but guarded, held under lock and seal" (Kliefoth). Hence more correctly Hofmann and Kliefoth say, "If the sins are sealed, they are on the one side laid under custody, so that they cannot any more be active or increase, but that they may thus be guarded and held, so that they can no longer be pardoned and blotted out;" cf. <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>.<p>The third statement is, "to make reconciliation for iniquity." &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; is terminus techn., to pardon, to blot out by means of a sin-offering, i.e., to forgive.<p>These three passages thus treat of the setting aside of sin and its blotting out; but they neither form a climax nor a mere &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, a multiplying of synonymous expressions for the pardoning of sins, ut tota peccatorum humani generis colluvies eo melius comprehenderetur (M. Geier). Against the idea of a climax it is justly objected, that in that case the strongest designation of sin, &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, which designates sin as a falling away from God, a rebelling against Him, should stand last, whereas it occurs in the first sentence. Against the idea of a &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; it is objected, that the words "to shut up" and "to seal" are not synonymous with "to make reconciliation for," i.e., "to forgive." The three expressions, it is true, all treat alike of the setting aside of sin, but in different ways. The first presents the general thought, that the falling away shall be shut up, the progress and the spreading of the sin shall be prevented. The other two expressions define more closely how the source whence arises the apostasy shall be shut up, the going forth and the continued operation of the sin prevented. This happens in one way with unbelievers, and in a different way with believers. The sins of unbelievers are sealed, are guarded securely under a seal, so that they may no more spread about and increase, nor any longer be active and operative; but the sins of believers are forgiven through a reconciliation. The former idea is stated in the second member, and the latter in the third, as Hofmann and Kliefoth have rightly remarked.<p>There follows the second group of three statements, which treat of the positive unfolding of salvation accompanying the taking away and the setting aside of sin. The first expression of this group, or the fourth in the whole number, is "to bring in everlasting righteousness." After the entire setting aside of sin must come a righteousness which shall never cease. That &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; does not mean "happiness of the olden time" (Bertholdt, Rsch), nor "innocence of the former better times" (J. D. Michaelis), but "righteousness," requires at present no further proof. Righteousness comes from heaven as the gift of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/85-11.htm">Psalm 85:11-14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5-8</a>), rises as a sun upon them that fear God (<a href="/malachi/3-20.htm">Malachi 3:20</a>), and is here called everlasting, corresponding to the eternity of the Messianic kingdom (cf. <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>). &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; comprehends the internal and the external righteousness of the new heavens and the new earth, <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>. This fourth expression forms the positive supplement of the first: in the place of the absolutely removed transgression is the perfected righteousness.<p>In the fifth passage, to seal up the vision and prophecy, the word &#1495;&#1514;&#1501;, used in the second passage of sin, is here used of righteousness. The figure of sealing is regarded by many interpreters in the sense of confirming, and that by filling up, with reference to the custom of impressing a seal on a writing for the confirmation of its contents; and in illustration these references are given: <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-10.htm">Jeremiah 32:10-11</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a> (Hvernick, v. Lengerke, Ewald, Hitzig, and others). But for this figurative use of the word to seal, no proof-passages are adduced from the O.T. Add to this that the word cannot be used here in a different sense from that in which it is used in the second passage. The sealing of the prophecy corresponds to the sealing of the transgression, and must be similarly understood. The prophecy is sealed when it is laid under a seal, so that it can no longer actively show itself.<p>continued...</body></html>
