Pride makes men obstinate in other sins. And as Judah was treading in the same steps, they would fall with Israel. By dealing treacherously with the Lord, men only deceive themselves. Those that go to seek the Lord with their flocks and their herds only, and not with their hearts and souls, cannot expect to find him; nor shall any speed who do not seek the Lord while he may be found.

For a mightier impulse mastered them and drove them into sin, as the evil spirit drove the swine into the deep.<p>The rendering of the margin, although less agreeable to the Hebrew, also gives a striking sense. "Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God." Not so much that their habits of sin had got an absolute mastery over them, so as to render repentance impossible; but rather, that it was impossible that they should turn inwardly, while they did not turn outwardly. Their evil doings, so long as they persevered in doing them, took away all heart, whereby to turn to God with a solid conversion.<p>And yet He was "their God;" this made their sin the more grievous. He, whom they would not turn to, still owned them, was still ready to receive them as "their God." For the prophet continues, "and they have not known the Lord." Him, "their God," they knew not. For the spirit which possessed them hindered them from thought, from memory, from conception of spiritual things. They did not turn to God,<p>(1) because the evil spirit held them, and so long as they allowed his hold, they were filled with carnal thoughts which kept them back from God.<p>(2) they did not know God; so that, not knowing how good and how great a good He is in Himself, and how good to us, they had not even the desire to turn to Him, for love of Himself, yea even for love of themselves.

Implying that they resist the Spirit of God, not suffering Him to renew them; and give themselves up to "the spirit of whoredoms" (in antithesis to "the Spirit of God" implied in "suffer" or "permit") (Ho 4:12; Isa 63:10; Eze 16:43; Ac 7:51).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hosea/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They, </span> those revolters, polluted Israelites and idolatrous Ephraimites, will not frame their doings; they are so intent upon their idolatries and oppressions, they have been so long inured to these doings, that now they are become slaves to their own doings, insomuch that they neither have will or power to change them, as <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/13-23.htm" title="Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.">Jeremiah 13:23</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To turn unto their God; </span> to repent of those wicked courses, and to leave them, and so return to their God, who was once theirs by covenant, though now they have violated the covenant, and departed from God.

The first clause is differently rendered. The textual rendering of the Authorized Version, viz. they will not frame (literally, <span class="accented">give</span>, <span class="accented">direct</span>) their doings to turn unto their God, denotes their total and absolute refusal to repent or to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. The actions are an index of the state of the heart, but neither the thoughts of Israel at this time, nor their deeds which indicated these thoughts, were in the direction of repentance. In heart and life they were impenitent. This rendering is supported by most of the Hebrew commentators. Rashi says, "They forsake not their evil way;" Aben Ezra," They perform not works so as to turn." Kimchi also gives an alternative sense: "Or the sense of the words is thus: They cling so closely to their evil works, that even should they for once conceive in their heart the idea of turning, they immediately repent them of it." The marginal rendering also yields a good sense; it is, <span class="accented">Their doings</span> <span class="accented">will not suffer</span> (allow) [<span class="accented">them</span>] <span class="accented">to turn unto their God</span>. The pronominal suffix for "them" is wanting, yet it may be dispensed with, as the appending of it to "doings" and "God" makes the sense sufficiently explicit. It is favored by Ewald, Keil, the Targum, and Kimchi, who explains: "Their evil works do not allow them to return to their God, as if he said, To such extent have they multiplied transgression that there is no way left them to return, until they receive their punishment." Such and so great was the power of their evil habits that they could not break them off or break away from them by repentance; or so intimately connected is a change of heart with a change of life that, in the absence of the latter, the former is impossible. According to either rendering, the reason assigned is contained in the next clause: <span class="cmt_word">For the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord.</span> So overmastered were they, as though by some fiendish spirit that held them in check and exercised despotic power over them, that they rushed headlong down the steep incline, like the Gadarene herd of swine, which, when the unclean spirits entered into them, ran violently down a steep place into the sea. Neither was there any counteracting force to turn them back or reverse their course. Such a force might have been found in the knowledge of God, of his covenant mercy, of his power, love, grace, and goodrich. But this was wanting, and the absence of this knowledge at once increased their impenitence and aggravated their guilt. It was Israel's privilege and Israel's duty to know the Lord; for he had revealed himself to them as to no other nation; he had given them his Law, he had made them depositaries of his truth and the conservators of his living oracles; their ignorance, therefore, was altogether inexcusable, while it evinced greatest ingratitude to Jehovah, who had taken them into covenant with himself, and declared himself to be their God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The granting of the prayer. - While Daniel was yet engaged in prayer (&#1492;&#1512; &#1511; &#1506;&#1500;, on account of the holy mountain, i.e., for it, see under <a href="/daniel/9-16.htm">Daniel 9:16</a>), an answer was already communicated to him; for the angel Gabriel came to him, and brought to him an explanation of the seventy years of Jeremiah, i.e., not as to their expiry, but what would happen after their completion for the city and the people of God. &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; , the man Gabriel, refers, by the use of the definite article, back to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15</a>, where Gabriel appeared to him in the form of a man. This is expressly observed in the relative clause, "whom I saw," etc. Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (at the first, <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>) see under <a href="/daniel/8-1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>. The differently interpreted words, &#1502;&#1506;&#1507; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1507;, belong, from their position, to the relative clause, or specially to &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (I had seen), not to &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, since no ground can be perceived for the placing of the adverbial idea before the verb. The translation of &#1502;&#1506;&#1507; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1507; by &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx), &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Theodot.), cito volans (Vulg.), from which the church fathers concluded that the angels were winged, notwithstanding the fact that rabbis, as e.g., Jos. Jacchiades, and modern interpreters (Hv., v. Leng., Hitz.) maintain it, is without any foundation in the words, and was probably derived by the old translators from a confounding of &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; with &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;. &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; means only wearied, to become tired, to weary oneself by exertion, in certain places, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>, by a long journey or course, but nowhere to run or to flee. &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;, weariness - wearied in weariness, i.e., very wearied or tired. According to this interpretation, which the words alone admit of, the expression is applicable, not to the angel, whom as an unearthly being, we cannot speak of as being wearied, although, with Kranichfeld, one may think of the way from the dwelling-place of God, removed far from His sinful people, to this earth as very long. On the contrary, the words perfectly agree with the condition of Daniel described in <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>., 27, and Daniel mentions this circumstance, because Gabriel, at his former coming to him, not only helped to strengthen him, but also gave him understanding of the vision, which was to him hidden in darkness, so that his appearing again at once awakened joyful hope. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, not he touched me, but he reached me, came forward to me.
