(Comp. Hosea 1) Some reference is involved to the consequences of intermarriage with heathen. The “month” may be a personification of the period of a month (Henderson), during which takes place the now closely impending (perhaps already commenced) invasion by Tiglathpileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>; 2 Chron. 19:21). This invasion was due in part to Ahaz having sought the aid of Assyria against Pekah and Rezin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hosea/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/5-7.htm" title="They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.">Hosea 5:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">They have dealt treacherously against the Lord — </span>The word <span class="greekheb">בגד</span>, rendered, <span class="ital">to deal treacherously, </span>signifies properly, a wife’s being false to her husband; see <a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm" title="Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 3:20</a>; from whence it is applied to the sin of idolatry, which was being false to the true God, or giving to creatures, or mere imaginary beings, the affection and regard due to him, and therefore it is often in Scripture styled spiritual whoredom. <span class="ital">For they have begotten strange children — A race of aliens, </span>as Bishop Horsley renders it: that is, children trained from their earliest infancy in the habits and principles of idolatry, and growing up aliens with respect to God, (for all are not Israel that are of Israel,) alienated from him in their affections, and in their sentiments and practice mere heathen.

Pride makes men obstinate in other sins. And as Judah was treading in the same steps, they would fall with Israel. By dealing treacherously with the Lord, men only deceive themselves. Those that go to seek the Lord with their flocks and their herds only, and not with their hearts and souls, cannot expect to find him; nor shall any speed who do not seek the Lord while he may be found. See how much it is our concern to seek God early, now, while it is the accepted time, and the day of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have dealt treacherously - Literally, "have cloaked," and so, acted deceitfully. The word is used of treachery of friend toward his friend, of the husband to his wife, or the wife husband. "Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord" <a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>. God, even in His upbraiding, speaks very tenderly to them, as having been in the closest, dearest relation to Himself.<p>For they have begotten strange children - God had made it a ground of the future blessing of Abraham, "I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment" <a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>. But these, contrariwise, themselves being idolaters and estranged from God, had children, who fell away like themselves, strangers to God, and looked upon as strangers by Him. The children too of the forbidden marriages with the pagan were, by their birth, strange or foreign children, even before they became so in act; and they became so the more in act, because they were so by birth. The next generation then growing up more estranged from God than themselves, what hope of amendment was there?<p>Now shall a month devour - The word now denotes the nearness and suddenness of God's judgments; the term "month," their rapidity. A "month" is not only a brief time, but is almost visibly passing away; the moon, which measures it, is never at one stay, waxing until it is full, then waning until it disappears. Night by night bears witness to the month's decay. The iniquity was full; the harvest was ripe; "now," suddenly, rapidly, completely, the end should come. One month should "devour them with their portions." God willed to be the Portion of His people; He had said, "the Lord's portion is His people; Jacob is the lot of His inheritance" <a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>. To Himself He had given the title, "the protion of Jacob" <a href="/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>. Israel had chosen to himself "other portions" out of God, for these, he had forsaken his God; therefore he should be consumed with them. "All that they had, all that they possessed, enjoyed, trusted in, all, at once, shall that short space, suddenly and certainly to come; devour, deprive and bereave them of; none of them shall remain with them or profit them in the day of wrath." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. treacherously&#8212;as to the marriage covenant (Jer 3:20).<p>strange children&#8212;alluding to "children of whoredoms" (Ho 1:2; 2:4). "Strange" or foreign implies that their idolatry was imported from abroad [Henderson]. Or rather, "regarded by God as strangers, not His," as being reared in idolatry. The case is desperate, when not only the existing, but also the rising, generation is reared in apostasy.<p>a month&#8212;a very brief space of time shall elapse, and then punishment shall overtake them (Zec 11:8). The allusion seems to be to money loans, which were by the month, not as with us by the year. You cannot put it off; the time of your destruction is immediately and suddenly coming on you; just as the debtor must meet the creditor's demand at the expiration of the month. The prediction is of the invasion of Tiglath-pileser, who carried away Reuben, Gad, Naphtali, and the half tribe of Manasseh.<p>portions&#8212;that is, possessions. Their resources and garrisons will not avail to save them. Henderson explains from Isa 57:6, "portions" as their idols; the context favors this, "the Lord" the true "portion of His people" (De 32:9), being in antithesis to "their portions," the idols.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hosea/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They, </span> the whole house of Israel, priests, people, and princes, and their kings with them, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">have dealt treacherously; </span> have falsified their word and promise of fidelity and constancy, of love and affection, when they entered covenant with me; have turned idolaters, and worshipped and relied on false gods. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They have begotten strange children; </span> as if it were not enough that they were idolaters, they have trained up their children in the same idolatry, partly by their instruction, and more by their examples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Now, </span> or therefore, or ere long, as <span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/2-10.htm" title="And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.">Hosea 2:10</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A month; </span> either the new moon, one particular species of ceremonial, superstitious worship put for all the rest, as some interpret, or rather, a time not long (as an age); not as to the old world, nor as to Nineveh, forty days, but a shorter time: possibly it may refer to Shallum’s short time of usurpation, which lasted but a month; a month shall devour them, the Assyrians shall make a speedy conquest over you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With their portions; </span> not only persons, but their goods and chattels, are exposed to speediest spoiling; and as a token of such future speedy desolation, the prophet points out a short reign of one of the usurpers, and foretells the precise time of his continuance, that when they shall see this come to pass.
