This jealousy culminated in the rebellion of Jeroboam I., and characterised their history till the reign of Ahab. Arrogance will be their ruin now; and in this Judah is represented as likewise involved. This last feature is a new note in prophetic utterance.

Together with Manasseh, (with whom they made, in some respects, one whole, as "the children of Joseph, <a href="/joshua/16-4.htm">Joshua 16:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14</a>), they were nearly equal in number to Judah. When numbered in the wilderness, Judah had 74,600 fighting men, Ephraim and Manasseh together 72,700. They speak of themselves as a "great people, forasmuch as the Lord has blessed me hitherto" <a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14</a>. God having chosen, out of them, the leader under whom He brought Israel into the land of promise, they resented, in the following time of the Judges, any deliverance of the land, in which they were not called to take a part. They rebuked Gideon (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a> ff), and suffered very severely for insolence (<a href="/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1</a> ff) to Jephthah and the Gileadites. When Gideon, who had refused to be king, was dead, Abimelech, his son by a concubine out of Ephraim, induced the Ephraimites to make Him king over Israel, as being their "bone and their flesh" <a href="/judges/8-31.htm">Judges 8:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-3</a>, <a href="/judges/9-22.htm">Judges 9:22</a>.<p>Lying in the midst of the tribes to the North of Judah, they appear, in antagonism to Judah, to have gathered round them the other tribes, and to have taken, with them, the name of Israel, in contrast with Judah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9-10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a>.

Their political dignity was not aggrieved, when God gave Saul, out of "little Benjamin," as king over His people. They could afford to own a king out of the least tribe. Their present political eminence was endangered, when God chose David out of their great rival, the tribe of Judah; their hope for the future was cut off by His promise to the posterity of David. They accordingly upheld, for seven years <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>, the house of Saul, knowing that they were acting against the will of God <a href="/2_samuel/3-9.htm">2 Samuel 3:9</a>.

Rehoboam was already king over Judah <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>, when he came to Shechem to be made king over Israel <a href="/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1</a>. Then the ten tribes sent for Jeroboam of Ephraim <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>, to make him their spokesman, and, in the end, their king. The rival worship of Bethel provided, not only for the indolence, but for the pride of his tribe. He made a state-worship at Bethel, over-against the worship ordained by God at Jerusalem. Just before the time of Hosea, the political strength of Ephraim was so much superior to that of Judah, that Jehoash, in his pride, compared himself to the cedar of Lebanon, Amaziah king of Judah to the thistle <a href="/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>. Isaiah speaks of "jealousy" <a href="/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a> or "envy," as the characteristic sin of Israel, which perpetuated that division, which, he foretold, should be healed in Christ. Yet although such was the power and pride of Israel, God foretold that he should first go into captivity, and so it was.<p>This pride, as it was the origin of the schism of the ten tribes, so it was the means of its continuance. In whatever degree any one of the kings of Israel was better than the rest, still "he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin." The giving up of any other sin only showed, how deeply rooted this sin was, which even then they would not give up. As is the way of unregenerate man, they would not give themselves up without reserve to God, to do all His will. They could not give up this sin of Jeroboam, without endangering their separate existence as Israel, and owning the superiority of Judah. From this complete self-surrender to God, their pride shrank and held them back.<p>The pride, which Israel thus showed in refusing to turn to God, and in preferring their sin to "their God," itself, he says, witnessed against them, and condemned them. In the presence of God, there needeth no other witness against the sinner than his own conscience. "it shall witness to his face," "openly, publicly, themselves and all others seeing, acknowledging, and approving the just judgment of God and the recompense of their sin." Pride and carnal sin are here remarkably united.<p>: "The prophet having said, the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, assigns as its ground, the pride of Israel will testify to his face, i. e., the sin which, through pride of mind, lurked in secret, bore open witness through sin of the flesh. Wherefore the cleanness of chastity is to be preserved by guarding humility. For if the spirit is piously humbled before God, the flesh is not raised unlawfully above the spirit. For the spirit holds the dominion over the flesh, committed to it, if it acknowledges the claims of lawful servitude to the Lord. For if, through pride, it despises its Author, it justly incurs a contest with its subject, the flesh."<p>Therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in - (or by) their iniquity Ephraim, the chief of the ten tribes, is distinguished from the whole, of which it was a part, because it was the rival of Judah, the royal tribe, out of which Jeroboam had sprung, who had formed the kingdom of Israel by the schism from Judah. All Israel, even its royal tribe, where was Samaria, its capital and strength, should fall, their iniquity being the stumbling-block, on which they should fall.<p>Judah also shall fall with them - "Judah also, being partaker with them in their idolatry and their wickedness, shall partake with them in the like punishment. Sin shall have the like effect in both." Literally, he saith, "Judah hath fallen," denoting, as do other prophets, the certainty of the future event, by speaking of it, as having taken place already; as it had, in the Mind of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the pride of Israel&#8212;wherewith they reject the warnings of God's prophets (Ho 5:2), and prefer their idols to God (Ho 7:10; Jer 13:17).<p>testify to his face&#8212;openly to his face he shall be convicted of the pride which is so palpable in him.

It may mean Israel’s vainglorious self-confidence, which is so hateful to Jehovah, and as it were testifies against Israel on the day of Jehovah’s assize (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a>). But it is more natural to take the phrase as a title of Jehovah (see on <a href="/hosea/4-18.htm" title="Their drink is sour: they have committed prostitution continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give you.">Hosea 4:18</a> ‘her rulers’, &c.), borrowed probably from <a href="/amos/8-7.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.">Amos 8:7</a>. How does Jehovah ‘testify against’ any one? The answer is furnished by <a href="/ruth/1-21.htm" title="I went out full and the LORD has brought me home again empty: why then call you me Naomi, seeing the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?">Ruth 1:21</a>, ‘Jehovah hath testified against me, and Shaddai hath afflicted me.’ An objection of small weight has been raised, viz. that Jehovah, in the prophetic figure, is the complainant and the judge, but not the witness. The answer is that the Hebrew ‘<span class="ital">ânâh</span> is not exactly ‘to witness’ but ‘to meet with words or a declaration’; hence it can be used of a judicial sentence. Hosea means that Jehovah has spoken one of those words which kill (comp. <a href="/hosea/6-5.htm" title="Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.">Hosea 6:5</a>)—has delivered a judgment by which Israel shall ‘fall.’ The rendering ‘Israel’s pride shall be humbled’ adopted in the ‘Speaker’s Commentary’ from the Sept., the Targum, and the Peshito, scarcely suits the following words ‘to (lit. in) his face.’ Still less suitable is it in <a href="/hosea/7-10.htm" title="And the pride of Israel testifies to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.">Hosea 7:10</a>, where the phrase is repeated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Israel and Ephraim</span>] i.e., Israel and especially Ephraim; like ‘Judah and Jerusalem’ (<a href="/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall fall</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">shall stumble.</span> A figure for calamity (as <a href="/isaiah/8-15.htm" title="And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.">Isaiah 8:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-3.htm" title="Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helps shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.">Isaiah 31:3</a>, and often). In <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a> the prophet uses less distinct language with regard to Judah’s punishment; she is warned not to offend rather than threatened with punishment. Perhaps this chapter represents the utterances of a later period than the preceding chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face.</span> This may be understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of Jehovah, who was Israel's glory, as we read in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a> <span class="accented">of</span> "the excellency of Israel." This explanation suits at once the sense and the context. They knew not God, notwithstanding the special advantages they enjoyed for that knowledge; they had no liking to the knowledge of' Go,], they did not concern themselves about it; and now Jehovah, who should have been their excellency and glory, but who had been thus slighted by them, will testify against them and bear witness to their face by judgments. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> another interpretation recommends itself as equally or more suitable. This interpretation understands "pride" more simply to mean the prosperous state and flourishing condition of which Israel was proud, or rather, perhaps, the haughtiness of Israel, owing to those very circumstances of worldly wealth and greatness. This vain pride and self-exaltation was the great obstacle in the way of their turning to the Lord. If this sense of the word be accepted, the verb had better be rendered" humbled," a meaning which it often has; thus, "humbled shall be the pride of Israel to his face" (that is, in his own sight). Such is the translation of the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "The pride of Israel shall be brought low before his face;" while the Chaldee translates similarly, "<span class="accented">The</span> glory of Israel shall be humbled while they see it;" the Syriac has, "The pride of Israel shall be humbled in his presence," or before his eyes. Aben Ezra also takes the idea of the verb to be humiliation or depression; while Kimchi takes <span class="accented">gaon</span> not so much in the sense of the inward feeling, as of <span class="accented">those</span> outward circumstances that promoted it - their greatness and grandeur and glory; and, alluding to the words of the Chaldee rendering, "in their sight," he says, "While they are still in their land before their captivity, they shall perceive their humiliation and degradation, instead of the glory which they had at the beginning." Kimchi, however, as well as most other commentators, seems to have understood the verb in the sense of "testify;" thus, "Israel's pride will testify to his face, when he shall take upon him its punishment." Therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. Pride usually goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. The consequence of Israel's pride was the fall here mentioned. The ten tribes composing the northern kingdom fell into gross and grievous sin, and therefore also into long-suffering and sore sorrow. Even Ephraim, that tribe pre-eminent for power as for pride, and the perpetual rival of Judah, shall fall as well as and with the rest. Judah also, that is, Judah proper, and Benjamin, participating in the same evil course, fell like Israel into sin, and, though more than a century later, into ruin. In vers. 6-10 the prophet details the unavailing and ineffectual efforts of Israel to avert, or at least escape from, the threatened judgments. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The granting of the prayer. - While Daniel was yet engaged in prayer (&#1492;&#1512; &#1511; &#1506;&#1500;, on account of the holy mountain, i.e., for it, see under <a href="/daniel/9-16.htm">Daniel 9:16</a>), an answer was already communicated to him; for the angel Gabriel came to him, and brought to him an explanation of the seventy years of Jeremiah, i.e., not as to their expiry, but what would happen after their completion for the city and the people of God. &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; , the man Gabriel, refers, by the use of the definite article, back to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15</a>, where Gabriel appeared to him in the form of a man.

The translation of &#1502;&#1506;&#1507; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1507; by &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx), &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Theodot.), cito volans (Vulg.), from which the church fathers concluded that the angels were winged, notwithstanding the fact that rabbis, as e.g., Jos. Jacchiades, and modern interpreters (Hv., v. Leng., Hitz.) maintain it, is without any foundation in the words, and was probably derived by the old translators from a confounding of &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; with &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;. &#1497;&#1506;&#1507; means only wearied, to become tired, to weary oneself by exertion, in certain places, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>, by a long journey or course, but nowhere to run or to flee. &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;, weariness - wearied in weariness, i.e., very wearied or tired. According to this interpretation, which the words alone admit of, the expression is applicable, not to the angel, whom as an unearthly being, we cannot speak of as being wearied, although, with Kranichfeld, one may think of the way from the dwelling-place of God, removed far from His sinful people, to this earth as very long. On the contrary, the words perfectly agree with the condition of Daniel described in <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>., 27, and Daniel mentions this circumstance, because Gabriel, at his former coming to him, not only helped to strengthen him, but also gave him understanding of the vision, which was to him hidden in darkness, so that his appearing again at once awakened joyful hope. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;, not he touched me, but he reached me, came forward to me. For this meaning of &#1504;&#1490;&#1506; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>. "About the time of the evening sacrifice." &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;, properly meat-offering, here comprehending the sacrifice, as is often its meaning in the later Scriptures; cf. <a href="/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-13.htm">Malachi 2:13</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-4.htm">Malachi 3:4</a>. The time of the evening oblation was the time of evening prayer for the congregation. </body></html>
