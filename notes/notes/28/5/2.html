Those that go to seek the Lord with their flocks and their herds only, and not with their hearts and souls, cannot expect to find him; nor shall any speed who do not seek the Lord while he may be found.

They willed also doubtless to "make it deep," hide it so deep, that God should never know it, as the Psalmist says of the ungodly, "that the inward self and heart of the worker's of iniquity is deep," whereon it follows, that God should "suddenly wound them," as here the prophet subjoins that God rebuked them.

The Psalmist's whole being was turned into prayer. So here, all the attributes of God, His mercies, love, justice, were concentrated into one, and that one, rebuke. Rebuke was the one form, in which they were all seen. It is an aggravation of crime to do it in the place of judgment or in the presence of the judge. Israel was immersed in his sin and heeded not, although God rebuked him continually by His voice in the law, forbidding all idolatry, and was now all the while, both in word and deed, rebuking him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. revolters&#8212;apostates.<p>profound&#8212;deeply rooted [Calvin] and sunk to the lowest depths, excessive in their idolatry (Ho 9:9; Isa 31:6) [Henderson].

Jeroboam thought it a profound piece of policy to set up golden calves to represent God in Dan and Beth-el, in order to prevent Israel's heart from turning again to David's line by going up to Jerusalem to worship.

The revolters are the king, priests, and people, who had revolted from the true worship and ways of God unto idolatry.

There is nothing at all in the context to suggest that the slaying of sacrifices is meant (as many after St Jerome have supposed), and it is very harsh to understand it as a fresh image for the priests’ abuse of their position. It is better to render (changing a Teth into a Tâv), <span class="bld">The apostates are gone deep in corrupting</span> (comp. <a href="/hosea/9-9.htm" title="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.">Hosea 9:9</a>). The ancient versions already found the passage obscure. The Septuagint (and similarly the Peshito) renders <span class="greekheb">δ</span> (sc. <span class="greekheb">τὸ δίκτυον</span>) <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀγρεύοντες τὴν θήραν κατέπηξαν</span>.

The literal rendering of the first clause is, <span class="accented">slaughtering they have made deep</span>, which is an idiom analogous to "they have deeply revolted;" literally, "they have made revolting deep" (<a href="/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>). The slaughtering, though understood by Wunsche of sacrifices, is rather meant of the destruction and carnage which the revolters caused to the people. Rashi explains it literally in this way: "I said, Every one that goes not up to the stated feasts transgresses a positive precept; but they decree that every one who goes up to the stated feasts shall be slain." This seems to imply that liers-in-wait were set probably on Mizpah and Tabor, the places mentioned in the preceding verse, to slay the Israelites that were found going up to the feasts at Jerusalem. Aben Ezra, taking this second verse as continuing the sentiment of the first, interprets as follows: "Ye have been a snare on Mizpah that ye might not allow them to go up to the feasts to the house of the Lord; and to slay (victims) in the usual way." The revolters or apostates he takes to be the worshippers of Baal. "<span class="accented">They</span> made deep," he adds in his exposition, "the snares, those that are mentioned, that passers-by might not see them; but I will chastise all of them for this evil which they have done, since it is not hidden from me why they have hid (made) it so deep." The slaughtering is thus understood by Aben Ezra of slaying the sacrificial victims. Similarly Kimchi interprets thus: "He says that the revolters who are the worshippers of idols, who depart from the ways of God - blessed be he! - and kern his service, like a woman who is a revolter from under her husband, have made deep their revolt, slaying and sacrificing to idols." lie would understand the slaughtering neither of victims with Kimchi and Aben Ezra; nor of literally slaying Israelites to prevent persons going up to Jerusalem, the proper seat of Jehovah's worship; but of the destructive consequences which the conduct of these apostates brought on the people. The work of chastisement God now takes in hand in good earnest. Droppings of the coming shower there had been; but now the full flood is to descend, for God presents himself to misleaders and misled alike under the sole aspect of rebuke. "I," he says, "am chastisement" (give myself to it). A like form of expression occurs in <a href="/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> am prayer;" that is, am a man of prayer, or give royal. If to prayer. Thus Kimchi explains the idiom: "<span class="accented">The</span> prophet says, Say not that no man shall correct and reprove them, therefore they sin; for I am the person who reproves them all, and day by day I reprove them, but they will not hearken to me. But <span class="accented">raani moser</span> wants the word <span class="accented">ish</span>, man, as (in <a href="/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>) <span class="accented">raani tephilah</span>, which we have explained <span class="accented">raani ish tephilah</span>." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The argument by which the prayer is urged, derived from a reference to the desolations, is strengthened by the words in apposition: and the city over which Thy name is named; i.e., not which is named after Thy name, by which the meaning of this form of expression is enfeebled. The name of God is the revelation of His being. It is named over Jerusalem in so far as Jehovah gloriously revealed Himself in it; He has raised it, by choosing it as the place of His throne in Israel, to the glory of a city of God; cf. <a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>., and regarding this form of expression, the remarks under <a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>.<p>The expression: and laying down my supplication before God (cf. <a href="/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>), is derived from the custom of falling down before God in prayer, and is often met with in Jeremiah; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/36-7.htm">Jeremiah 36:7</a>.

This energy shows itself in the number of words used in <a href="/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a> and <a href="/daniel/9-19.htm">Daniel 9:19</a>. Chr. B. Mich., under <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-19.htm">Daniel 9:19</a>, has well remarked: "Fervorem precantis cognoscere licet cum ex anaphora, seu terna et mysterii plena nominis Adonai repetitione, tum ex eo, quod singulis hisce imperativis He paragogicum ad intensiorem adfectum significandum superaddidit, tum ex congerie illa verborum: Audi, Condona, Attende, reliqua." </body></html>
