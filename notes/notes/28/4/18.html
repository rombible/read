For Israel was devoted to idols, and must now be let alone. When sinners cast off the easy yoke of Christ, they go on in sin till the Lord saith, Let them alone. Then they receive no more warnings, feel no more convictions: Satan takes full possession of them, and they ripen for destruction. It is a sad and sore judgment for any man to be let alone in sin.

Yet it were perhaps more correct to render, "her rulers do love, do love, shame."  They love that which brings shame, which is bound up with shame, and ends in it; and so the prophet says that they "love the shame" itself. They act, as if they were in love with the shame, which, all their lives long, they are unceasingly and, as it were, by system, drawing upon themselves. They chase diligently after all the occasions of sins and sinful pleasures which end in shame; they omit nothing which brings it, do nothing which can avoid it. What else or what more could they do, if they "loved the shame" for its own sake? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

In their stomachs, having drank so much that they cannot digest it; hence nauseous eructations, with a filthy stench, are belched out; so it is a charge of drunkenness which Ephraim or the ten tribes were addicted to, and are accused of, <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1</a> or "their drink is gone" (y); it has lost its colour, brightness, smell, and flavour; it is turned to vinegar; expressive of the general corruption and depravity of manners and religion among them; see <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a> or "their drink departeth", or "causeth to depart"; or "is refractory" (z); that is, it made them refractory, like a refractory belief, as before; caused them to depart from God and his worship, and led them into all sin and irreligion, particularly what follows: <p>they have committed whoredom continually; corporeal whoredom, which drunkenness leads to; and spiritual whoredom or idolatry, which they had committed, and continued in, ever since the days of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and increased therein: <p>her rulers with shame do love, give ye; or "her shields" (a); those that should have been the protectors of Israel, compared before to a heifer; and preserved them not only from their external enemies, but from all innovations in religion; and which we rightly enough render "rulers", civil and ecclesiastic, kings, princes, and priests; see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>, these "loved, give ye", which was a "shame" to them: the sense is, either they loved gifts and bribes, and were continually saying, "give, give", when causes were to be tried, and so perverted justice and judgment, which was very shameful; or they loved wine and strong drink, and therefore required it to be continually given them, which was very scandalous in rulers more especially, <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>; or they loved whoredom, both in a corporeal and spiritual sense, and desired more harlots and more idols, and added to their old ones, which was very abominable and ignominious. So the Targum, <p>"they turned themselves after fornication they loved, which brought shame unto them;'' <p>and these may be considered as so many reasons why Judah should have nothing to do with Israel. <p>(y)  "recessit potus eorum", Montanus, Drusius; "recessit vinum eorum", Schmidt.

If the text is correct, the only version at once intelligible and philologically sound is, ‘Their drunkenness has passed by.’ For the rendering of the verb comp. <a href="/1_samuel/15-32.htm" title="Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.">1 Samuel 15:32</a> Hebr., and for ‘drunkenness’, lit. drink, comp. <a href="/1_samuel/1-14.htm" title="And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.">1 Samuel 1:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-37.htm" title="But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.">1 Samuel 25:37</a> (where ‘wine’ must be synonymous with ‘the fumes of wine’). Connecting this clause with the following, we may render (as Henderson, following the Jewish commentator Abarbanel), <span class="bld">When their carousal is over they indulge in lewdness</span>, i.e. when tired of one sin they plunge without scruple into another. The Sept. rendering <span class="greekheb">ἡρέτισε Χαναναίους</span> is very difficult to justify. The Peshito omits the words. St Jerome explains the whole clause, Factum est, inquit Deus, convivium eorum à me alienum.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">her rulers with shame do love, Give ye</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">her shields are enamoured of infamy</span> (Henderson). This involves a slight change in the points, necessary in order to make sense of the word rendered ‘infamy.’ Probably, however, as Abp. Seeker was the first to infer from Sept. and Pesh., there is an erroneous repetition of three letters (comp. a similar case in <a href="/psalms/88-17.htm" title="They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.">Psalm 88:17</a>), so that we may render simply, ‘her shields love infamy’ (‘shields’ for ‘rulers’, as <a href="/psalms/47-9.htm" title="The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong to God: he is greatly exalted.">Psalm 47:9</a>). The Septuagint, indeed, suggests a various reading which possibly deserves the preference; it renders, <span class="greekheb">ἠγάπησαν ἀτιμίαν ἐκ φρυάγματος αὐτῆς</span>. Here, as in <a href="/amos/8-7.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.">Amos 8:7</a>, the Greek translator seems to have misunderstood the expression, ‘the excellency of Jacob’ (i.e. Jehovah). The Hebrew which he had before them may be thus put into English, <span class="bld">they love infamy rather than her Excellency</span> (or, her Pride, i.e. Jehovah, Israel’s God). <span class="greekheb">Φρύαγμα</span> is in fact the rendering of Heb. <span class="ital">gâôn</span> in <a href="/zechariah/11-3.htm" title="There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.">Zechariah 11:3</a> and three other passages.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - The first of these two verses gives a picture of the degeneracy of the times; the second predicts the destruction that would ensue. <span class="cmt_word">Their drink is sour</span> (margin, <span class="accented">is gone</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they have committed whoredom continually.</span> If the first clause be taken literally, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it denotes a charge of drunkenness preferred against Ephraim. To this vice the people of the northern kingdom, as is well known, were addicted: the wine, from oft-repeated potations, became sour in the stomach and produced loathsome eructations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some, connecting closely the first and second clauses, and translating as in the margin, explain the meaning to be that "when their intoxication is gone they commit whoredom." But though drunkenness and debauchery frequently go together, it is rather during the former than afterwards that the latter is indulged in. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The first clause had better be understood figuratively, and the latter either literally or figuratively, or both. Thus the sense is the degeneracy of principle among the people in general, or rather among the principal men of that day. By the finest wine becoming vapid, the prophet represents the leading men of the nation, on whom so much depended and from whom so much might be expected, as becoming unprincipled, and as being addicted to immorality or idolatry, or probably both (<span class="accented">hazneh hiznu</span>): "whoring they have committed whoredom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">Her rulers</span> (margin, <span class="accented">shields</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with shame do love, Give ye</span>; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">her shields lore</span>, <span class="accented">love shame</span>. The first takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, as imperative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to give, and should rather be, "Her shields love, ' Give ye  - shame, as there is no preposition before the word "shame;" even thus it is awkward. Most modern expositors take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> as a contraction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d5;</span>, and so a repetition of part of the full verb preceding; thus: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "loved, loved." Ewald, Delitzsch, and Pusey understand it so; the latter says this "is probably one of the earliest forms of the intensive verb, repeating a part of the verb itself with its inflection." And Keil calls it "a construction resembling the <span class="accented">pealal</span> form." Among the <span class="accented">sebirin</span>, or conjectural readings, we find both words united into one; thus: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, equivalent to "mightily love." The shields are the princes, or natural protectors of the state, as in <a href="/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>, "The princes of the people are gathered together.., for the shields of the earth be. long unto God." The shame they loved was the sin which is a shame to either princes or people, causes shame, and ends in shame. Isaiah expounds the thought (in <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>), a comparison of which confirms the above exposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">The wind hath bound her up in her wings</span>; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">she hath bound up the wind with her in her skirts</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the one case the wind is the strong storm-wind of Divine wrath that will seize on Ephraim, wrap her up with its wings, and carry her away. In the other, Ephraim wraps up the wind, that is, disappointment, the result of her sin, in the fold of her skirt. The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> translation of the first clause of ver. 19 is supported by Rashi: "The storm takes her in its wings, as that bird which the wind does not let rest until it makes him go far away; so the enemies will come upon them and carry them into exile." Translation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> is favored by Aben Ezra and Kimchi; the former says, "As the man who binds the wind in the folds of his robe without finding anything therein." <span class="cmt_word">And they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</span> Frustrated in her hopes, and disappointed by the idols, from which she hoped so much and got so little, she is ashamed of the sacrifices she offered them; not of the altars (LXX.), for the preposition <span class="accented">rain</span> is indispensable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this confession, there now follows the prayer for the turning away of the wrath (<a href="/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a> and <a href="/daniel/9-16.htm">Daniel 9:16</a>) of God, and for the manifestation of His grace toward His suppliant people (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-17.htm">Daniel 9:17-19</a>).<p><a href="/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a><p>This prayer Daniel founds on the great fact of the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, by which the Lord made for Himself a name among the nations. Jerome has here rightly remarked, not exhausting the thought however: "memor est antiqui beneficii, ut ad similem Dei clementiam provocet." For Daniel does not view the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt merely as a good deed, but as an act of salvation by which God fulfilled His promise He had given to the patriarchs, ratified the covenant He made with Abraham, and by the miracles accompanying the exodus of the tribes of Israel from the land of Egypt, glorified His name before all nations (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-32.htm">Isaiah 63:32</a>, 13), so that Moses could appeal to this glorious revelation of God among the heathen as an argument, in his prayer for pardon to Israel, to mitigate the anger of God which burned against the apostasy and the rebellion of the people, and to turn away the threatened destruction, <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>., <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>. Jeremiah, and also Isaiah, in like manner ground their prayer for mercy to Israel on the name of the Lord, <a href="/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11-15</a>. Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/1-10.htm">Nehemiah 1:10</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/9-10.htm">Nehemiah 9:10</a>) in this agrees with Jeremiah and Daniel. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, in the same connection in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50</a>, does not mean, then, at that time, but, as this day still: (hast gotten Thee) a name as Thou hast it still. In order to rest the prayer alone on the honour of the Lord, on the honour of His name, Daniel again repeats the confession, we have sinned, we have done wickedly; cf. <a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>.</body></html>
