Judah.</span>—The prophet warns Judah of Israel’s peril, and perhaps hints at the apostacy of some of her kings, as Ahaziah, Joram, and Ahaz. He returns <span class= "ital">to</span> the symbolic use of the word “whoredom”; and Judah is exhorted not to participate in the idolatries of Gilgal or the calves of Bethel. There are three different places named Gilgal mentioned in Joshua (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm" title="And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.">Joshua 4:19</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-3.htm" title="And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:">Joshua 12:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-7.htm" title="And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:">Joshua 15:7</a>), and a fourth seems to be mentioned in Deut. 9:30; <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.">2Kings 2:1</a>. The Gilgal here referred to is the first of these, which Joshua for a considerable time had made his head-quarters. In the days of Samuel it acquired some importance as a place for sacrificial worship and the dispensation of justice. Bethel had a grand history. But Hosea and Amos call it by the altered name <span class= "ital">Beth-aven</span> (house of vanity, or idols), instead of Bethel (house of God). The LXX. in Alex. MS. read <span class= "ital">On</span> instead of <span class= "ital">Aven</span> in the Hebrew, On being the name for Heliopolis, the seat of sun-cultus, whence Jeroboam may have derived his calf-worship. (See Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible,</span> Art. “On.”) But the Vat. MS. has <span class= "greekheb">ἀδικίας</span><span class= "ital">,</span> in accordance with the Masoretic tradition (similarly Aquila and Symmachus).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hosea/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Though, </span>&c. — “Here,” says Bishop Horsley, “a transition is made, with great elegance and animation, from the general subject of the whole people, in both its branches, to the kingdom of the ten tribes in particular.” <span class="ital">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot — </span>Though thou followest after idols; <span class="ital">yet let not Judah offend — </span>Let not Judah do so too: at least let <span class="ital">her </span>keep herself pure. Let her not join in the idolatrous worship at Gilgal or Beth-aven, or mix idolatry with the profession of the true religion. The kingdom of Judah still retained, in a great degree, the worship of the true God, and the ordinances of the temple service. Therefore the prophet exhorts that people not to be led away by the bad example of their brethren of the ten tribes. Gilgal, it must be observed, was remarkable for being the place where the Israelites renewed their rite of circumcision, when they first passed over Jordan; but after Jeroboam set up idolatry, it became famous for the worship of false gods. And it appears, from this prophet and Amos, that it was particularly so in this period of the Jewish history. <span class="ital">Beth- aven </span>was the same with <span class="ital">Beth-el, </span>and was the place where one of Jeroboam’s calves was worshipped. The word <span class="ital">Beth-el </span>signifies <span class="ital">the house of God, </span>and was the name given to that place by Jacob, because of God’s appearing to him there, <a href="/genesis/28-17.htm" title="And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.">Genesis 28:17</a>. But when it became a place noted for idolatrous worship, the worshippers of the true God called it, in detestation, <span class="ital">Beth-aven, </span>that is, <span class="ital">the house of vanity. Nor swear, The Lord liveth — </span>Do not mingle the worship of the true God with idolatrous rites, nor dare to swear by his name while worshipping idols, or before the calves, as if they represented him; for he abhors every such coalition.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:12-19 The people consulted images, and not the Divine word. This would lead to disorder and sin. Thus men prepare scourges for themselves, and vice is spread through a people. Let not Judah come near the idolatrous worship of Israel. For Israel was devoted to idols, and must now be let alone. When sinners cast off the easy yoke of Christ, they go on in sin till the Lord saith, Let them alone. Then they receive no more warnings, feel no more convictions: Satan takes full possession of them, and they ripen for destruction. It is a sad and sore judgment for any man to be let alone in sin. Those who are not disturbed in their sin, will be destroyed for their sin. May we be kept from this awful state; for the wrath of God, like a strong tempest, will soon hurry impenitent sinners into ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let not Judah offend - The sentence of Israel had been pronounced; she had been declared incorrigible. The prophet turns from her now to Judah. Israel had abandoned God's worship, rejected or corrupted His priests, given herself to the worship of the calves; no marvel what further excess of riot she run into! But Judah, who had the law and the temple and the service of God, let not her, (he would say,) involve herself in Israel's sin. If Israel, in willful blindness, had plunged herself in ruin, let not Judah involve herself in her sin and her ruin. He turns (as elsewhere) incidentally to Judah.<p>Come ye not unto Gilgal - Gilgal lay between Jericho and the Jordan. There, ten furlongs from the Jordan, first in all the promised land, the people encamped; there Joshua placed the monument of the miraculous passage of the Jordan; there he renewed the circumcision of the people which had been intermitted in the wilderness, and the feast of the passover; there the people returned, after all the victories by which God gave them possession of the land of promise <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9-10</a>; <a href="/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6-9</a>, <a href="/joshua/10-43.htm">Joshua 10:43</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>.

It was part of the policy of Jeroboam to take hold of all these associations, as a sort of set-off against Jerusalem and the temple, from which he had separated his people. In opposition to this idolatry, Elisha for a time, established there one of the schools of the prophets <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>.<p>Neither go ye up to Bethaven - "Bethaven," literally, "house of vanity," was a city East of "Bethel" <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>, "the house of God." But since Jeroboam had set up the worship of the calves at Bethel, Bethel had ceased to be "the house of God," and had become "a house or temple of vanity;" and so the prophet gave it no more its own name which was associated with the history of the faith of the patriarchs, but called it what it had become. In Bethel God had twice appeared to Jacob, when he left the land of promise <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10</a>, <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a> a to go to Laban, and when he returned <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1</a>, <a href="/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>.

It too Jeroboam profaned by setting up the calf there. To these places then, as being now places of the idolatry of Israel, Judah is forbidden to go, and then to "swear, the Lord liveth." For to swear by the Lord in a place of idolatry would be to associate the living God with idols <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, which God expressly forbade. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

"Go up" refers to the fact that Beth-el was on a hill (Jos 16:1).<p>nor swear, The Lord liveth&#8212;This formula of oath was appointed by God Himself (De 6:13; 10:20; Jer 4:2).

There was in Ahab’s time a college of prophets; and now, whether out of reverence to the place on these accounts, or for what other reasons, it matters not, but certain it is, this Gilgal was chosen out by Jeroboam, or by succeeding idolaters, for a place of public worship of their idols, and grew famous for it. Go not up to partake of their idolatry, or to learn it. It is a concise speech, which forbids all the sins committed at Gilgal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither go ye up to Beth-aven; </span> which is Beth-el, where Jacob lodged, had a vision of angels, and a more comfortable vision of God, who appeared to Jacob, who for this gave name to the place, and called it Beth-el, house of God; but when Jeroboam made it the place of his calf worship, it became, and is called, Beth-avert, house of vanity or iniquity. Go not thither to worship. It is as the former, a prohibition of being of that religion which was in use at Beth-avert, and had been the established religion for two hundred years, or thereabouts, viz. ever since Jeroboam’s time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nor swear, The Lord liveth</span> this is in itself lawful oath, and may be used; but in the circumstances wherewith it is here attended it is forbidden, because many who went thither yet pretended there to sacrifice only to the true God, that they owned him the only living God, reverenced him, swore by him; though they went up to Beth-avert or Gilgal, yet they worshipped God there. This is a synecdoche, a part being put for the whole worship of God, which the prophet warns them not to blend and mix with idolatries, which yet was done before Josiah’s time, <span class="bld"><a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm" title="And them that worship the host of heaven on the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;">Zephaniah 1:5</a></span>, which see, with the annotations on it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hosea/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend,.... That is, though the Israelites, the people of the ten tribes, committed adultery, both corporeal and spiritual, in their idolatrous worship, as before observed, to which they had been used ever since the times of Jeroboam the first, and were hardened therein, and from which there were little hopes of reforming them; yet let not the men of Judah be guilty of the same crimes, who have as yet retained the pure worship of God among them; where the house of God is, and the priests of the Lord officiate, and sacrifices are offered up to him according to his will, and all other parts of religious service are performed: or the whole seems to be directed to Israel, as an exhortation to them, that though they had given into such abominations, yet should be careful not to offend Judah, or cause them to stumble and fall, and become guilty of the same sins, and so be exposed to the same punishment; and which would be an aggravation of Israel's sin, to draw others into it with them: <p>and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven; to worship idols in those places; otherwise it might be lawful to go to them on any civil accounts: Gilgal was upon the borders of the ten tribes, between them and Judah, where Joshua circumcised the Israelites; kept the first passover in the land; and where the ark and tabernacle were for a time; and perhaps for these reasons was chosen for a place of idolatrous worship: Bethaven is the same with Bethel, the name Jacob gave it, signifying the house of God; but when Jeroboam set up one of his calves here, the prophets, by way of contempt, called it Bethaven, the house of iniquity, or the house of an idol; though there was a place called Bethaven near Bethel, and Ai, as Kimchi observes, and as appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>, yet Bethel was sometimes so called, as it seems to be here, because of the idolatry in it; and so the Talmudists (u) say, the place called Bethel is now called Bethaven. Now the question is, whether Judah or Israel are here addressed; many interpreters carry it in the former sense, as if the men of Judah were dissuaded from going to these places for worship, when the temple, the proper place of worship, was in their own tribe; but the speech seems rather to be directed to the Israelites, to stop going to these places for worship; for being so near to Judah, they might be the means of ensnaring and drawing them into the same idolatrous practices: <p>nor swear, the Lord liveth; or swear by the living God, so long as they worshipped idols; for it was not well pleasing to God to have his name used by idolaters, or joined with their idols: especially as they meant their idol when they swore by the Lord. <p>(u) T.

Probably they are right. No doubt, we should have expected this Gilgal to have belonged to Judah, but the natural boundary of the two kingdoms was not the historical one; ‘those places which their past history had rendered most sacred or memorable—Bethel, Gilgal, Jericho—were incorporated in the northern kingdom’ (Ewald, <span class="ital">Hist.</span> iv. 3).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither go ye up to Beth-aven</span>] A Beth-aven near Bethel is mentioned <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country.

From proximity to those idolatries and debaucheries so prevalent in this northern kingdom, and from the corruption at least of the court in the southern kingdom during the reigns of Joram, Ahaziah, and Ahaz, Judah was in danger; and hence the prophet turned aside, with words of earnest warning, to the sister kingdom not to involve herself in the same or similar guilt. Rashi's brief comment here is, "Let not the children of Judah learn their ways." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-avert, nor swear, The Lord liveth.</span> From a solemn warning in general terms, he proceeds to a specific prohibition. The prohibition forbids pilgrimages to places of idol-worship, such as Gilgal and Bethaven; it also forbids a profession of Jehovah-worship to be made by persons inclined to idolatrous practices. Gilgal, now the village of <span class="accented">Jiljilia</span>, which had been a school of the prophets in the days of Elijah and Elisha, had, as we may rightly infer from passages in Hoses and Amos, become a seat of idolatrous worship. The Hebrew interpreters confound the Gilgal here referred to with the still more renowned Gilgal between Jericho and the Jordan, where Joshua circumcised the people a second time, and celebrated the Passover, and where, manna failing, the people ate of the old corn of the land. "And why," asks Kimchi, "to Gilgal? Because at Gilgal the sanctuary was at the first when they entered the land; therefore when they went to worship idols they built high places there for the idols. But with respect to the tribe of Judah, what need has it to go to Gilgal and to leave the house of the sanctuary which is in their own cities?" And Beth-el, now <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, had become Beth-avon - the house of God a house of idols, after Jeroboam had set up the calf there. Judah was to eschew those places so perilous to purity of worship; also a practice hypocritical in its nature and highly dangerous in its tendency, namely, confessing Jehovah with the lips, and by a solemn act of attestation indicative of adherence to his worship, but belying that confession by complicity in idolatrous practices, like the peoples who "worshipped Jehovah, but served their own gods." Kimchi observes as follows: "For ye engage in strange worship, and yet swear by the Name of Jehovah; this is the way of incensing and despising him." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse the Kethiv &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, in harmony with the ancient versions, is to be maintained, and the Keri only as an explanation inferred from the thought of a definite curse.
