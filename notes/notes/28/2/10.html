They did not turn, therefore all this came upon them; and it is written for admonition to us. If lesser difficulties be got over, God will raise greater. The most resolute in sinful pursuits, are commonly most crossed in them. The way of God and duty is often hedged about with thorns, but we have reason to think it is a sinful way that is hedged up with thorns. Crosses and obstacles in an evil course are great blessings, and are to be so accounted; they are God's hedges, to keep us from transgressing, to make the way of sin difficult, and to keep us from it. We have reason to bless God for restraining grace, and for restraining providences; and even for sore pain, sickness, or calamity, if it keeps us from sin. The disappointments we meet with in seeking for satisfaction from the creature, should, if nothing else will do it, drive us to the Creator. When men forget, or consider not that their comforts come from God, he will often in mercy take them away, to bring them to think upon their folly and danger. Sin and mirth can never hold long together; but if men will not take away sin from their mirth, God will take away mirth from their sin. And if men destroy God's word and ordinances, it is just with him to destroy their vines and fig-trees. This shall be the ruin of their mirth. Taking away the solemn seasons and the sabbaths will not do it, they will readily part with them, and think it no loss; but He will take away their sensual pleasures. Days of sinful mirth must be visited with days of mourning.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her lewdness - The word originally means "folly," and so "foulness." For sin is the only real folly, as holiness is the only true wisdom. But the folly of sin is veiled amid outward prosperity, and people think themselves, and are thought, wise and honorable and in good repute, and are centers of attraction and leaders of society, so long as they prosper; as it is said, "so long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak of thee" <a href="/psalms/49-18.htm">Psalm 49:18</a>. But as soon as God withdraws those outward gifts, the mask drops off, and people, being no longer dazzled, despise the sinner, while they go on to hug the sin. God says, "I will discover," as just before He had said, that His gifts had been given to "cover her." He would then lay her bare outwardly and inwardly; her folly, foulness, wickedness, and her outward shame; and that, "in the sight of her lovers," i. e. of those whom she had chosen instead of God, her idols, the heavenly bodies, the false gods, and real devils. Satan must jeer at the wretched folly of the souls whom he deceives.<p>And none shall deliver her out of My hand - Neither rebel spirits nor rebel people. The evil spirits would prolong the prosperity of the wicked, that so they might sin the more deeply, and might not repent, (which they see people to do amid God's chastisements,) and so might incur the deeper danmation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. lewdness&#8212;rather, "the shame of her nakedness"; laying aside the figure, "I will expose her in her state, bereft of every necessary, before her lovers," that is, the idols (personified, as if they could see), who, nevertheless, can give her no help.

The figure of a faithless female being continued, the calamities of Israel are pictured in the extreme deplorableness of her condition. The word <span class="accented">navluth</span> does not elsewhere occur, but its meaning is not difficult to ascertain. It denotes literally, "slackness," "laxness," or a withered state, from <span class="accented">navel</span>, to be withered, and may be translated either "her shame" or "her turpitude." The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, while Jerome renders it <span class="accented">stultitiam</span>. Thus she is exposed to the derision and disgust of her former admirers and paramours; while deliverance is out of the question. Her lovers are the idols, or, according to Kimchi," Egypt and Assyria, which cannot deliver her." She who once was the object of delight is become the object of disdain and contempt; nor is there any of her quondam lovers desirous of or able to deliver her out of the hand of him who administers the justly deserved punishment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Daniel had for a while contemplated the conduct of the ram, he saw a he-goat come from the west over the earth, run with furious might against the two-horned ram, and throw it to the ground and tread upon it. The he-goat, according to the interpretation of the angel, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, represents the king of Javan (Greece and Macedonia) - not the person of the king (Gesen.), but the kingship of Javan; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, the great horn of the goat symbolizes the first king, and thus the goat itself cannot represent a separate king. The goat comes from the west; for Macedonia lay to the west of Susa or Persia. Its coming over the earth is more definitely denoted by the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1504;&#1493;&#1490;&#1506; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, and he was not touching the earth, i.e., as he hastened over it in his flight. This remark corresponds with the four wings of the leopard, <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a>. The goat had between its eyes &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1511;&#1512;&#1503;; i.e., not a horn of vision, a horn such as a goat naturally has, but here only in vision (Hofm., Klief.). This interpretation would render &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; an altogether useless addition, since the goat itself, only seen in vision, is described as it appeared in the vision. For the right explanation of the expression reference must be made to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, where, instead of horn of vision, there is used the expression &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1511;&#1512;&#1503; (the great horn). Accordingly &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; has the meaning of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, in the Keri &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-21.htm">2 Samuel 23:21</a>, a man of countenance or sight (cf. Targ. <a href="/esther/2-2.htm">Esther 2:2</a>): a horn of sight, consideration, of considerable greatness; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (lxx, Theodot.), which Theodoret explains by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;.<p>The horn was between the eyes, i.e., in the middle of the forehead, the centre of its whole strength, and represents, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, the first king, i.e., the founder of the Javanic world-kingdom, or the dynasty of this kingdom represented by him. The he-goat ran up against the ram, the possessor of the two horns, i.e., the two-horned ram by the river Ulai, in the fire of his anger, i.e., in the glowing anger which gave him his strength, and with the greatest fury threw him down. The prophet adds, "And I saw him come close unto the ram," as giving prominence to the chief matter, and then further describes its complete destruction. It broke in pieces both of the horns, which the ram still had, i.e., the power of the Medes and Persians, the two component elements of the Persian world-kingdom. This representation proves itself to be genuine prophecy, whilst an author writing ex eventu would have spoken of the horn representing the power of the Medes as assailed and overthrown earlier by that other horn (see under <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>). The pushing and trampling down by the Ulai is explained from the idea of the prophecy, according to which the power of the ram is destroyed at the central seat of its might, without reference to the historical course of the victories by which Alexander the Great completed the subjugation of the Persian monarchy. In the concluding passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-7.htm">Daniel 8:7</a>, the complete destruction is described in the words of the fourth verse, to express the idea of righteous retribution. As the Medo-Persian had crushed the other kingdoms, so now it also was itself destroyed. </body></html>
