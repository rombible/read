This would more easily account for the change of person (“your “. . . “their “), which is, however, very frequent in Hebrew prophecy. The next “for” introduces a parenthetical clause—“her lovers”<span class= "ital">—</span>a word used in a bad sense. The aggravation of her shame is that she seeks them, and not they her. She attributes to these idol-gods all those temporal benefits which theocratic history shows to have been Jehovah’s gift, and the consequence of loyalty to Him. The modern analogue of this sin of Israel is the use of “Fortune,” “Nature,” “Destiny,” “Impersonal Law,” and even “Humanity,” as the giver of all good things, as though it were superstitious or heretical to speak of God as the giver.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-5 This chapter continues the figurative address to Israel, in reference to Hosea's wife and children. Let us own and love as brethren, all whom the Lord seems to put among his children, and encourage them in that they have received mercy. But every Christian, by his example and conduct, must protest against evil and abuses, even among those to whom he belongs and owes respect. Impenitent sinners will soon be stripped of the advantages they misuse, and which they consume upon their lusts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She that conceived them hath done shamefully, literally, hath made shameful - The silence as to "what" she "made shameful" is more emphatic than any words. She "made shameful" everything which she could "make shameful," her acts, her children, and herself.<p>I will go after my lovers - (:iterally let me go, I would go). The Hebrew word "Meahabim" denotes intense passionate love; the plural form implies that they were sinful loves. Every word aggravates the shamelessness. Amid God's chastisements, she encourages herself, "Come, let me go," as people harden and embolden, and, as it were, lash themselves into further sin, lest they should shrink back, or stop short in it. "Let me go after." She waits not, as it were, to be enticed, allured, seduced. She herself, uninvited, unbidden, unsought, contrary to the accustomed and natural feeling of woman, follows after those by whom she is not drawn, and refuses to follow God who would draw her (see <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31-34</a>). The "lovers" are, whatever a man loves and courts, out of God. They were the idols and false gods, whom the Jews, like the pagan, took to themselves, besides God. But in truth they were devils. Devils she sought; the will of devils she followed; their pleasure she fulfilled, abandoning herself to sin, shamefully filled with all wickedness, and travailing with all manner of impurity. These she professed that she loved, and that they, not God, loved her. For whoever receives the gifts of God, except from God and in God's way, receives them from devils. Whoso seeks what God forbids, seeks it from Satan, and holds that Satan, not God, loves him; since God refuses it, Satan encourages him to possess himself of it. Satan, then, is his lover.<p>That gave me my bread and my water - The sense of human weakness abides, even when divine love is gone. The whole history of man's superstitions is an evidence of this, whether they have been the mere instincts of nature, or whether they have attached themselves to religion or irreligion, Jewish or Pagan or Muslim, or have been practiced by half-Christians. "She is conscious that she hath not these things by her own power, but is beholden to some other for them; but not remembering Him (as was commanded) who had "given her power to get wealth, and richly all things to enjoy," she professes them to be the gifts of her lovers." "Bread and water, wool and flax," express the necessaries of life, food and clothing; "mine oil and my drink" (Hebrew, drinks), its luxuries. Oil includes also ointments, and so served both for health, food and medicine, for anointing the body, and for perfume. In perfumes and choice drinks, the rich people of Israel were guilty of great profusion; from where it is said, "He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich" <a href="/proverbs/21-17.htm">Proverbs 21:17</a>. For such things alone, the things of the body, did Israel care. Ascribing them to her false gods, she loved these gods, and held that they loved her. In like way, the Jewish women shamelessly told Jeremiah, "we will certainly do whatsoever thing goes out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

This is shameful indeed, and the prophet hath set it forth to the life: and now is there not good reason why a Husband so abused should without pity cast off such a mother, such children, and leave them to live on their chosen lovers, or to perish under the hatred of their despised God? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hosea/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For their mother hath played the harlot,.... Or committed idolatry; which is the reason why she is to be pleaded with, and why the Lord will not own her as his wife, or be a husband to her; and why she is to be exhorted to put away her whoredoms from her; and was in danger of all the above evils coming upon her, continuing in the same practice; and why her children were children of whoredoms. Though the connection may be with the verse following, "for" or "because their mother hath played the harlot", &amp;c. "therefore I will hedge up her way", &amp;c. <p>She that conceived them hath done shamefully; all sin is shameful and scandalous, especially adultery; it brings a reproach and a blot upon a person, that will not be wiped off; and so idolatry, worshipping stocks and stones instead of the living God; and particularly the sin of the Jewish church, in rejecting the true Messiah and his righteousness, and setting up their own, and tenaciously adhering to the traditions of the elders; and so departing from the true God, and his word and worship, which is no other than spiritual adultery or idolatry. The Targum is, <p>"because their congregation hath erred after the false prophets, their teachers are confounded;'' <p>and which Jarchi interprets of the wise men that teach doctrines, who are ashamed because of the people of the earth; to whom they say, ye shall not steal, and yet they steal themselves; see <a href="/romans/2-21.htm">Romans 2:21</a>. Or, "she hath made ashamed" (f); her husband, and her children: or, "she is confounded" (g), and "ashamed" herself, for what she has done. <p>For she said, I will go after my lovers; her idols, as the ten tribes did after the calves at Dan and Bethel. So Kimchi's father interprets it of the sun, moon, and stars, they worshipped: though he himself understands it of the Assyrians and Egyptians they were in alliance with, and trusted in. Some join together the Gentile nations and their gods. Or else it may be understood of the Jews seeking to the Romans, and courting their favour and friendship; desiring to be governed not by their own kings, but by the Romans (h); declaring they had no king but Caesar, and rejecting Christ as such, <a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12</a> or rather of their beloved tenets, concerning traditions, the rites and ceremonies of the law, self-righteousness, &amp;c.: the words are expressive of impudence, obstinacy, and self-will; resolving to pursue their own fancies and have their own wills, be it as it would. <p>That give me my bread and any water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink; "or drinks" (i); wine and other liquors, as Kimchi; these take in everything belonging to food and raiment, and all the necessaries, and even delights and pleasures, of life: bread and water; all sorts of food: wool and flax; all sorts of clothing, both woollen and linen, for outward or inward covering: and oil, and drinks, or liquors; everything for pleasure and delight; all which she ascribed not to God, from whence all good things come; but, which was an aggravation of her sin, to her lovers, her allies, or her idols; as the Jews did their plenty of victuals to the queen of heaven, and their worship of her, <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a> and as, in the times of Christ, they ascribed not only their enjoyment of temporal good things, but their righteousness, life, and salvation, to their observance of traditions, rites, and ceremonies, and the externals of religion. <p>(f) "pudefecit", Junius apud Rivet.

"Mother" is repeated in and emphasized by the parallel words, "she that conceived them." A somewhat similar form of expression is that in <a href="/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>, "The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies." To <span class="accented">bosh</span>, to be ashamed, belong the Hiphil forms, <span class="accented">hebhish</span> and <span class="accented">hobhish</span> (the latter formed from <span class="accented">zabhish</span>), properly "to put to shame," but also "to practice shame or do shameful things." The nature of her shameful conduct is more definitely and distinctly expressed in the clauses which follow; and consisted of several particulars. There is the persistent pursuit of her lovers; then the unblushing boldness with which she avows her determination to continue that course; and next come her expectations from them. <span class="cmt_word">That give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink</span> (margin, <span class="accented">drinks</span>). The original word here rendered "lovers" is the Piel participle, which may have either its usual intensive sense or its occasional causative sense in which it is taken by Rosenm&uuml;ller, who has "a-mare me facientes," equivalent to "wooers." It matters little which way we understand it. The more important point is to determine who or what are here meant by lovers. Most commentators understand them to be those nations whose friendship Israel set such store by - the Assyrians and the Egyptians. Thus Grotius and Jerome, - the latter explains them of the Assyrians and Egyptians and other nations, with whose idols Israel committed fornication, and from which in distress they vainly hoped for help; so also Kimchi, in the following comment: "By 'friends ' he implies the Assyrians and Egyptians joined in alliance to the Israelites, who delivered them from their enemies, so that they lived safely, in return for the gifts (tribute) which they (the Israelites) were in the habit of giving them. And as they lived in tranquility in virtue of the compact entered into with them, the prophet represents it as if they supplied them with all the necessaries of life. For with their help they tilled their land without fear and in safety traded from country to country." Kimchi quotes at the same time his father's (Joseph Kimchi) interpretation: "But my lord my father of blessed memory explained 'after her lovers' of the sun and moon and stars, which they worshipped; while their intention was that they gave them their food and their sufficiency, as they said, 'But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.'" This exposition of Joseph Kimchi is much nearer the truth than that of his son David; it is, however, too restricted. The "lovers" were the idols on which the people of the northern kingdom so dented, and on which they placed so much dependence. The blessings which they vainly expected from these idols are enumerated: they were - food and raiment and luxuries; the bread and water were the articles of food as it is written elsewhere. "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure;" the wool and flax were the materials for clothing; while the oil and drinks were, the former for ornament, the latter for refresh-merit, and so included all luxuries; thus in <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> anointest my head with oil;" and in <a href="/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>, "And mingled my drink [literally, 'drinks,' the same word, <span class="accented">shigguyar</span>] with weeping;" also in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> we read of "wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthened man's heart." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Vision<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>, <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a> contain the historical introduction to this new revelation. This was given to Daniel in the third year of the reign of Belshazzar, and thus two years after the vision of the four world-kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>), but not in a dream as that was, but while he was awake. The words, I, Daniel, are neither a pleonasm (Hv.) nor a sign that the writer wished specially to give himself out for Daniel (Ewald), but expressly denote that Daniel continues to speak of himself in the first person (Kliefoth). The article in &#1492;&#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (that which appeared) takes place of the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and the expression is concise for &#1504;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; (the vision which appeared); cf. Ewald's Lehr. 335a. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (at the first), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>, in the general signification earlier, and in <a href="/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-21.htm">Genesis 41:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/43-18.htm">Genesis 43:18</a>, <a href="/genesis/43-20.htm">Genesis 43:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>, synonymous with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; (in the beginning). Here the word points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, and in <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a> it refers to <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a> of this chapter.<p>"In vision," i.e., &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, not &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, Daniel was placed in the city of Susa, in the province of Elam (Elymas). By the words, "I saw in vision; and it came to pass when I saw," which precede the specification of the scene of the vision, is indicated the fact that he was in Susa only in vision, and the misconception is sufficiently guarded against that Daniel was actually there in the body. This is acknowledge by v. Leng., Hitzig, Maurer, Hv., Hgstb., Kran., and Kliefoth, against Bertholdt and Rosenmller, who understand this, in connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>, as meaning that Daniel was personally present in Susa to execute the king's business, from which Bertholdt frames the charge against the pseudo-Daniel, that he was not conscious that Elam under Nabonned did not belong to Babylon, and that the royal palace at Susa had as yet no existence. But this accusation has no historical foundation. We have no accurate information whether under Belshazzar Elam was added to Babylon or the Chaldean empire. It is true that not Hengstenberg (Beitr. i. p. 42f.) only has, with older theologians, concluded from the prophecies of <a href="/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>., compared with <a href="/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, that Nebuchadnezzar subjugated Susa, but Niebuhr also (Gesch. Assurs, p. 211ff.) seeks from these and other passages of the O.T. to establish the view, that Nebuchadnezzar, after the death of Cyaxares (Uwakhshatra), to whom he owed allegiance, refused to do homage to his successor, and entered on a war against Media, which resulted in the annexation of Elam to his kingdom. But, on the contrary, Hvernick has well remarked, that the subjugation of Elam by Nebuchadnezzar can scarcely harmonize with the fact of the division of the Assyrian kingdom between the Babylonian king Nabopolassar and the Median king Cyaxares, whereby the former obtained the western and the latter the eastern half, and that from these passages of prophecy a subjugation of Elam by the Chaldeans cannot be concluded. Jeremiah announces neither in <a href="/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> nor in <a href="/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>. a conquest of Elam by Nebuchadnezzar, but rather in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49.htm">Jeremiah 49</a> prophesies the complete destruction of Elam, or a divine judgment, in language which is much too strong and elevated for a mere making of it tributary and annexing it to a new state.<p>Besides, this passage in no respect requires that Susa and Elam should be regarded as provinces of the Chaldean kingdom, since the opinion that Daniel was in Susa engaged in some public business for the Chaldean king is founded only on a false interpretation of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>, <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>. From the prophet's having been placed in an ecstasy in the city of Susa, there follows nothing further than that this city was already at the time of the existing Chaldean kingdom a central-point of Elamitish or Persian power. And the more definite description of the situation of this city in the words, "which was in the province of Elam," points decidedly to the time of Daniel, in which Susa as yet belonged to the province of Elam, while this province was made a satrapy, Susis, Susiana, now Chusistan, by the kings of Persia, and Susa became the capital of this province; therefore the capital Susa is not reckoned as situated in Elam by writers, who after this time distinguish between Susis (Susiana) and Elymas (Elam), as Strabo, xvi. 1. 17f., Pliny, hist. nat. vi. 27: Susianen ab Elymaide disterminat amnis Eulaeus.<p>Still more groundless is the assertion, that the city of Susa was not in existence in the time of Daniel, or, as Duncker (Gesch. der Alterth. ii. p. 913, 3 Auf.) affirms, that Darius first removed the residence or seat of the king to Susa with the intention that it should become the permanent residence for him and his successors, the central-point of his kingdom and of his government, and that Pliny and Aelian say decidedly that Darius built Susa, the king's city of Persia, and that the inscriptions confirm this saying. For, to begin with the latter statement, an inscription found in the ruins of a palace at Susa, according to the deciphering of Mordtmann (in der D. morgl. Ztschr. xvi. pp. 123ff.), which Duncker cites as confirming his statement, contains only these words: "Thus speaks Artaxerxes the great king, the son of Darius the son of Achmenides Vistapa: This building my great-great-grandfather Darius erected; afterwards it was improved by Artaxerxes my grandfather." This inscription thus confirms only the fact of the building of a palace in Susa by Darius, but nothing further, from which it is impossible to conclude that Darius first founded the city, or built the first tower in it. Still less does such an idea lie in the words of Aelian, nat. animal. i.:59: "Darius was proud of the erection of a celebrated building which he had raised in Susa." And Pliny also, taken strictly, speaks only of the elevation of Susa to the rank of capital of the kingdom by Darius, which does not exclude the opinion that Susa was before this already a considerable town, and had a royal castle, in which Cyrus may have resided during several months of the year (according to Xenophon, Cyrop. viii. 6. 22, Anab. iii. 5. 15; cf. Brissonius, de regio Pers. princ. p. 88f.).<p>(Note: Pliny, hist. nat. vi. 27, says regarding Susiana, "In qua vetus regia Presarum Susa a Dario Hystaspis filio condita," which may be understood as if he ascribed to Darius the founding of the city of Susa. But how little weight is to be given to this statement appears from the similar statement, hist. nat. vi. 14 (17): "Ecbatana caput Mediae Seleucus rex condidit," which plainly contains an error, since Ecbatana, under the name of Achmeta, is mentioned (<a href="/ezra/6-2.htm">Ezra 6:2</a>) in the time of Darius Hystaspes, in the tower of which the archives of the Persian kings were preserved.)<p>The founding of Susa, and of the old tower in Susa, reaches back into pre-historic times. According to Strabo, xv. 2. 3, Susa must have been built by Tithonos, the father of Memnon. With this the epithet &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, which Herod. vii. 151, v. 54, 53, and Aelian, nat. anim. xiii. 18, gives to the town of Susa, stands in unison. For if this proves nothing more than that in Susa there was a tomb of Memnon (Hv.), yet would this sufficiently prove that the city or its citadel existed from ancient times - times so ancient that the mythic Memnon lived and was buried there.<p>The city had its name &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, Lily, from the lilies which grew in great abundance in that region (Athen. Deipnos. xii. p. 409; Stephan. Byz., etc.), and had, according to Strabo, xv. 3. 2, a circuit of 120 (twelve English miles), and according to others, 200 stadia. Its palace was called Memnoneion, and was strongly fortified. Here was "the golden seat;" here also were "the apartments of Darius, which were adorned with gold," as Aeschylos says (Pers. 3. 4. 159, 160), "the widely-famed palace," - the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;, as Diod. Sic. xvii. 65, expresses himself.<p>The ruins of Susa are not only a wilderness, inhabited by lions and hyaenas, on the eastern banks of the Shapur, between it and the Dizful, where three great mountains of ruins, from 80 to 100 feet high, raise themselves, showing the compass of the city, while eastward smaller heaps of ruins point out the remains of the city, which to this day bear the name Schusch; cf. Herz.'s Realenc. xvi. p. 263f., and Duncker, Gesch. d. Alt. ii. p. 942ff.<p>The designation of Elam as &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, a province, does not refer to a Chaldean province. &#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, in Greek  &#787;&#x395;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#836;&#769;&#x3c2;, formed the western part of the Persian satrapy of Susis or Susiana, which lay at the foot of the highlands of Iran, at the beginning of the valley of the Tigris and the Euphrates between Persia and Babylon, called by the Persians Uvaja, and by the Greeks Susis or Susiana after the capital, or Cissia after its inhabitants. It is bounded by the western border mountains of Persia and the Tigris, and on the south terminates in a arm, swampy and harbourless coast, which stretches from the mouth of the Tigris to that of the Aurvaiti (Oroatis). Strabo (xv. 732) says Susiana is inhabited by two races, the Cissaei and the Elymi; Herodotus (iii. 91, v. 49, vii. 62), on the contrary, names only the Cissaei as the inhabitants of the country of the same name. The saying put into circulation by Josephus (Antt. i. 6. 4,  &#787;&#769;&#x395;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;  &#787;&#x395;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;), that the Elamites are the primitive race of the Persians, has no historical foundation. The deep valley of the Tigris and the Euphrates was the country of the Semites. "The names of the towns and rivers of the country confirm the statements of Genesis, which names Elam among the sons of Shem, although the erecting of the Persian royal residence in Elam, and the long continuance of the Persian rule, could not but exercise, as it did, an influence on the manners and arts of the Semitish inhabitants" (Duncker, p. 942).<p>The further statement, that Daniel in vision was by the river Ulai, shows that Susa lay on the banks of the river. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; is the &#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Eulaeus, of the Greeks and Romans, of which Pliny says, "circuit arcem Susorum," and which Arrian (Exped. Alex. vii. 7) also mentions as a navigable river of Susis. On the contrary, Herodotus, i. 188, v. 49, 52, and Strabo, xv. 3, 4, place Susa on the river Choaspes. These contradictory statements are reconciled in the simplest manner by the supposition that Ulai, Eulaeus, was the Semitish, Choaspes the Aryan (Persian) name of the Kuran, which received the Shapur and Dizful. In favour of this, we have not only the circumstance that the name Choaspes is undoubtedly of Persian origin, while, on the other hand, &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; is a word of Semitic formation; but still more, that Herodotus knows nothing whatever of the Eulaeus, while Ptolemy (vi. 3. 2) does not mention the Choaspes, but, on the contrary, two sources of the Eulaeus, the one in Media, the other in Susiana; and that what Herod. i. 188, says of the Choaspes, that the kings of Persia drink its water only, and caused it to be carried far after them, is mentioned by Pliny of the Eulus, h. n. vi. 27, and in 31:3 of the Choaspes and Eulus.<p>(Note: There is little probability in the supposition that Choaspes is the modern Kerrah or Kerkha, the Eulus the modern Dizful, as Susa lay between these two rivers (Ker Porter, Winer, Ruetschi in Herz.'s Realen. xv. 246), and receives no sufficient support from the bas relief of Kojundshik discovered by Layard, which represents the siege of a town lying between two rivers, since the identification of this town with Susa is a mere conjecture.)<p>Daniel was in spirit conveyed to Susa, that here in the future royal citadel of the Persian kingdom he might witness the destruction of this world-power, as Ezekiel was removed to Jerusalem that he might there see the judgment of its destruction. The placing of the prophet also on the river of Ulai is significant, yet it is not to be explained, with Kranichfeld, from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-6.htm">Daniel 8:6</a>, "where the kingdom in question stands in the same relation to the flowing river as the four kingdoms in <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a> do to the sea." For the geographically defined river Ulai has nothing in common with the sea as a symbol of the nations of the world (<a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). The Ulai is rather named as the place where afterwards the ram and the he-goat pushed against one another, and the shock followed, deciding the fate of the Persian kingdom.<p>As, the, the scene of the vision stands in intimate relation to its contents, so also the time at which the revelation was made to Daniel. With the third year of Belshazzar the dynasty of Nebuchadnezzar, the founder of the Babylonian world-kingdom, was extinguished. In this year Belshazzar, the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar, died, and the sovereignty was transferred to a collateral branch, and finally to an intruder, under whom that world-kingdom, once so powerful, in a few years fell to pieces. Shortly before the death of Belshazzar the end of the Babylonian monarchy was thus to be seen, and the point of time, not very remote, which must end the Exile with the fall of Babylon. This point of time was altogether fitted to reveal to the prophet in a vision what would happen after the overthrow of Babylon, and after the termination of the Exile.</body></html>
