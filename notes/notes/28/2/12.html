They did not turn, therefore all this came upon them; and it is written for admonition to us. If lesser difficulties be got over, God will raise greater. The most resolute in sinful pursuits, are commonly most crossed in them. The way of God and duty is often hedged about with thorns, but we have reason to think it is a sinful way that is hedged up with thorns. Crosses and obstacles in an evil course are great blessings, and are to be so accounted; they are God's hedges, to keep us from transgressing, to make the way of sin difficult, and to keep us from it. We have reason to bless God for restraining grace, and for restraining providences; and even for sore pain, sickness, or calamity, if it keeps us from sin. The disappointments we meet with in seeking for satisfaction from the creature, should, if nothing else will do it, drive us to the Creator. When men forget, or consider not that their comforts come from God, he will often in mercy take them away, to bring them to think upon their folly and danger. Sin and mirth can never hold long together; but if men will not take away sin from their mirth, God will take away mirth from their sin. And if men destroy God's word and ordinances, it is just with him to destroy their vines and fig-trees. This shall be the ruin of their mirth. Taking away the solemn seasons and the sabbaths will not do it, they will readily part with them, and think it no loss; but He will take away their sensual pleasures.

The vine and fig tree are usually conjoined, and by a common synecdoche convey the idea of all those sources that combine to support life and supply its luxuries. When the united kingdom of Judah and Israel, before the disruption, had obtained the zenith of prosperity in the reign of Solomon, it is thus expressed: Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon." Yet Israel knew not the time of her merciful visitation, and not only turned aside to idols, but most stupidly and most inexcusably attributed the many mercies she enjoyed to the idols which she worshipped. Like a foul adulteress despising the tokens of her husband's affection and delighting in the rewards of lewdness received from licentious paramours, Israel forfeited all her privileges, and forced the Lord to withdraw his bounties and destroy their very source. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5e4;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, to be bent, from the arch made by its drooping boughs, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5df;</span>, to extend from its length. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span> The places where fig trees flourished and vines abounded shall be stripped of those trees, with their pleasant fruits - shall become a forest.

The context, however, militates against the reading in question, for in time of war or general devastation places, through neglect, grow trees and brushwood, where wild beasts lair and lay waste. The explanation of the verse is well given by Kimchi in his commentary: "Because she said, 'These are the hire of my harlotry;' because she said that from the hand of her lovers came the corn and must and oil and all good things; - I will make them a desolation, that she may know whether she had those good things from me or from them. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, because he has compared her to a harlot, he calls those good things <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>; while their signification is identical with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>, and their root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> [extend, reach, give], the aleph being prosthetic.

And he mentions the vine and the fig tree because grapes and figs are the best part of the food of man after the produce of the earth (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. corn); and already he had said, 'I will also take away my corn in its season.'" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The transformation of the Javanic kingdom. - By the kingdom of the ram the he-goat became very great, powerful (&#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; as in <a href="/daniel/8-4.htm">Daniel 8:4</a>). But the great horn was broken at the height of his strength, and four similar horns grew up in its stead, toward the four regions of heaven. &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is here used adverbially, conspicuously: there came forth conspicuously four in its place. This statement does not contradict <a href="/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>, according to which the four kingdom shave not the power of the one great horn; for the thought is only this: they represent in themselves a considerable power, without, however, gaining the power of the one undivided kingdom. The breaking of the great horn indicates the breaking up of the monarchy of Alexander by his death. The four horns which grow up in the place of the one great horn are, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-22.htm">Daniel 8:22</a>, four kingdoms. These are the dynasties of the Diadochs, of whom there were indeed five: Antigonus, Ptolemy, Cassander, and Lysimachus laid claim to the title of king; but for the first time after the overthrow of Antigonus at the battle of Ipsus, 301 b.c., and thus twenty-two years after the death of Alexander (323 b.c.), they became in reality four kings, and so divided the kingdom among themselves, that Lysimachus had Thrace and Bithynia, - Cassander, Macedonia and Greece, - Seleucus, Syria, Babylonia, and the Eastern countries as far as India, - and Ptolemy, Egypt, Palestine, and Arabia Petrea. But from the fact that this first happened after all the descendants of the royal family had been extirpated, we are not to conclude, with Hvernick, that the breaking of the great horn did not denote the death of Alexander, but the extinction of his race or house; a conclusion which derives no valid support from these words of Justin: "All of them abstained from the use of the insignia of this (royal) dignity while the sons of their king survived. So great was their veneration, that although they had royal wealth and resources, they cared not for the name of kings so long as there existed a legitimate heir to Alexander" (Hist. xv. 2. 13). If the breaking of the horn is placed at the point of time when the horn was powerful, here as well as at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>, the reference of the words to the sudden death of Alexander in the prime of his days, and when in the very height of his victorious career, cannot be disputed; and by the breaking of the horn we can only understand Alexander's death, and the breaking up of the kingdom founded by him, although it was still held together in a considerable degree for two decenniums by his generals, till the most imperious and the most powerful amongst them usurped the rank of kings, and then, after the conquest of Antigonus, a formal division of the kingdom into the four considerable kingdoms here named raised them to royal dignity.<p>The prophetic representation is not a prediction of historical details, but it gives only the fundamental traces of the development of the world-kingdoms, and that not in the form of a historiographical prophecy, but only so that it sketches the ground-thoughts of the divinely ordained unfolding of these world-kingdoms. This ideal fundamental thought of the prophecy has so wrought itself out in actual history, that from the one great kingdom, after the death of the founder, in the course of time four considerable kingdoms arise. The number four in the prophetic contemplation comes into view only according to its symbolical idea as the number of the world in its extension toward the four regions of heaven, so that thereby only the thought is declared, that a kingdom embracing the world will fall to ruins in a plurality of kingdoms toward all the regions of heaven (Kliefoth). This has been so historically realized, that out of the wars of the Diadochs for the supremacy four kingdoms arose toward the four regions of the earth into longer duration, - that of Cassander (Macedonia) toward the west, that of Seleucus (Babylonia, etc.) toward the east, that of Lysimachus (Thracia and Bithynia) toward the north, and finally that of Ptolemy (Egypt) toward the south.<p>(Note: When, on the other hand, Hitzig seeks to explain the prophetic representation, here as well as at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>, that with or immediately after the death of Alexander his kingdom was divided, by reference to 1 Macc. 1:6, according to which Alexander himself, shortly before his death, divided the kingdom among his generals, he thereby not only misapprehends the ideal character of the prophecy, but does not in the least degree clear up the matter itself. For the passage in 1 Macc. 1:6, which not only Arabic and Persian authors repeat, but also Moses v. Chroene, and even later Greek and Latin historiographers, as Ammian Marcell., has been explained by Curtius (x. 10. 5) as a fama vana, and is proved by Wernsdorf (de Fide Librr. Macc. p. 40 f) and Droysen (das Test. Alex. 3te Beilage, zu Gesch. des Hellen. i.) to be without foundation (cf. Grimm, K. ex. Hdb. zu 1 Macc. 1:6). This may have been originally put into circulation by the partisans of the Hellenic kings, in order to legitimatize their sovereignty in the eyes of the people, as Grimm conjectures; yet the confirmation which the book of Daniel appears to give to it contributed to its wide diffusion by Oriental and Byzantine authors, and the author of the first book of the Maccabees had without doubt the book of Daniel before his eyes in the representation he gives.) </body></html>
