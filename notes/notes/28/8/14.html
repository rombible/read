The Lord had caused his law to be written for them, but they cared not to know, and would not obey it. Man seems by the temples he builds to be mindful of his Maker, yet really he has forgotten him, because he has cast off all his fear; but none ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. So long as men despise the truths and precepts of God's word, and the ordinances of his worship, all the observances and offerings, however costly, of their own devising, will be unto them for sin; for those services only are acceptable to God, which are done according to his word, and through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker - God was his Maker, not only as the Creator of all things, but as the Author of his existence as a people, as He saith, "hath he not made thee, and established thee?" <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>.<p>And buildeth temples - as for the two calves, at Bethel and at Dan. Since God had commanded to build one temple only, that at Jerusalem, to "build temples" was in itself sin. The sin charged on Ephraim is idolatry; that of Judah is self-confidence ; from where Isaiah blames them, that they were busy in repairing the breaches of the city, and cutting off the supplies of water from the enemy; "but ye have not looked unto the Maker thereof, neither had respect unto Him, that fashioned it long ago <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>.

Remarkably enough, we find these words repeated seven times in Amos as a refrain to as many denunciations (<a href="/amos/1-4.htm" title="But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.">Amos 1:4</a> to <a href="/amos/2-5.htm" title="But I will send a fire on Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.">Amos 2:5</a>). It seems hardly likely that so original a prophet should have quoted these words; perhaps they were a well-known prophetic commonplace.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In these verses there is a fuller statement of the manner in which he treats the princes of the covenant and takes possession of their territory. The  &#1493;at the beginning of <a href="/daniel/11-23.htm">Daniel 11:23</a> is explicative, and the suffix in &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, pointing back to &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;, is also to be interpreted collectively. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, literally, "from the confederating himself with them" (&#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; is infin. formed in the Syriac manner), i.e., from the time when he had made a covenant with them, he practised deceit. This was done by his coming (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; of a warlike coming) and gaining strength with a few people, namely (<a href="/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>), by his coming unexpectedly into the fattest and richest places of the province, and there doing unheard-of things - things which no previous king, no one of his predecessors, had ever done, scattering among them (his followers) spoil and prey and riches. Thus rightly, after the Syriac and the Vulgate (dissipabit), Rosenmller, Kranichfeld, and Ewald; while, on the contrary, v. Leng., Maurer, Hitzig, and Kliefoth interpret &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512; in the sense of to distribute, and refer the words to the circumstance that Antiochus Epiphanes squandered money lavishly, and made presents to his inferiors often without any occasion. But to distribute money and spoil is nothing unheard of, and in no way does it agree with the "fattest provinces." The contest decidedly refers to conduct which injured the fat provinces. This can only consist in squandering and dissipating the wealth of this province which he had plundered to its injury (&#1500;&#1492;&#1501; [to them], dativ. incommodi). An historical confirmation is found in 1 Macc. 3:29-31. To bring the provinces wholly under his power, he devises plans against the fortresses that he might subdue them. &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1506;&#1514;, and indeed (he did this) even for a time. We cannot, with Klief., refer this merely to the last preceding passage, that his assaults against the fortresses succeeded only partly and for a time. The addition ("and that for a time") denotes a period determined by a higher power (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6</a>), and relates to the whole proceedings of this prince hitherto described; as C. B. Michaelis has already rightly explained: nec enim semper et in perpetuum dolus ei succedet et terminus suus ei tandem erit. </body></html>
