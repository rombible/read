It was so in the ten tribes. For they cast off Rehoboam, simply of their own mind, because he would not lessen the taxes, as they prescribed. If he would have consented to their demands, they would have remained his subjects <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>. "They set up kings, but not by or through" God, whom they never consulted, nor asked His will about the rules of the kingdom, or about its relation to the kingdom of Judah, or the house of David. They referred these matters no more to God, than if there had been no God, or than if He interfered not in the affairs of man. It was self-will in Jeroboam himself, for he received the kingdom (which Ahijah told him, he "desired") not from God, not requiring of him, how he should undertake it, nor anointed by Him, nor in any way acknowledging Him, but from the people. And as soon as he had received it, he set up rebellion against God, in order to establish his kingdom, which he founded in sin, whereby he made Israel to sin.<p>In like way, the Apostle says, "against Thy holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined before to be done" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>, <a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a>. Yet not the less did they sin in this Deicide; and the Blood of Jesus has ever since, as they imprecated on themselves, been on the Jews and on their children, as many as did not repent.<p>As was the beginning of the kingdom of Israel, such was its course. "They made kings, but not from God." Such were all their kings, except Jehu and his house. During 253 years, for which the kingdom of Israel lasted eighteen kings reigned over it, out of ten different families, and no family came to a close, save by a violent death. The like self-will and independence closed the existence of the Jewish people. The Roman Emperor being afar off, the Scribes and Pharisees hoped, under him, without any great control, to maintain their own authority over the people. They themselves, by their "God forbid!" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/20-16.htm">Luke 20:16</a>, owned that our Lord truly saw their thoughts and purpose, "This is the heir; come let us kill Him, that the inheritance may be ours." They willed to reign without Christ, feared the Pagan Emperor less than the holiness of Jesus, and in the words, "We have no king but Caesar," they deposed God, and shut themselves out from His kingdom.<p>And I knew it not - "As far as in them lay, they did it without His knowledge" <a href="/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>. They did not take Him into their counsels, nor desire His cognizance of it, or His approbation of it. If they could, they would have had Him ignorant of it, knowing it to be against His will. And so in His turn, God knew it not, owned it not, as He shall say to the ungodly, "I know you not" <a href="/matthew/25-12.htm">Matthew 25:12</a>.<p>Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols - God had multiplied them, (as He said before <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>), and they ungratefully abused to the dishonor of the Giver, what He gave them to be used to His glory.<p>That they may be cut off - Literally, "that he may be cut off." The whole people is spoken of as one man, "one and all," as we say. It is a fearful description of obstinate sin, that their very object in it seemed to be their own destruction. They acted with one will as one man, who had, in all he did, this one end - to perish. : "As if on set purpose they would provoke destruction, and obstinately run themselves into it, although forewarned thereof." Holy Scripture speaks of that as people's end, at which all their acts aim. "They see, not, nor know, that they may be ashamed" <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>; i. e., they blind themselves, as though their whole object were, what they will bring upon themselves, their own shame. "They prophesy a lie in My Name, that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you" <a href="/jeremiah/27-15.htm">Jeremiah 27:15</a>. This was the ultimate end of those false prophecies. The false prophets of Judah filled them with false hopes; the real and true end of those prophecies, that in which they ended, was the ruin of those who uttered, and of those who listened to them. We ourselves say almost proverbially, "he goes the way to ruin himself;" not that such is the man's own object, but that he obstinately chooses a course of conduct, which, others see, must end in utter ruin. So a man chooses destruction or hell, if he chooses those tilings which, according to God's known law and word, end in it. Man bides from his own eyes the distant future, and fixes them on the nearer objects which he has at heart. God lifts the veil, and discovers to him the further end, at which he is driving, which he is, in fact, compassing, and which is in truth the end, for his own fleeting obiects perish in the using; this and this alone abides. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. kings &#8230; not by me&#8212;not with My sanction (1Ki 11:31; 12:20).

Not by his authority, order, and command; not by asking advice of him, or his leave, but of themselves, and of their own, accord: this refers to the case of Jeroboam their first king, after their separation from the house of David, and from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin; for though his becoming king of Israel was according to the secret will of God, and by his overruling providence; yet it was done without his express orders, and without asking counsel of him, or his consent, and of their own heads; and many of his successors were conspirators, and set up themselves with the consent of the people, to the dethroning of others, and upon the slaughter of them, as Shallum, Menahem, Pekah, and Hoshea: the people of Israel had no right to choose a king for themselves; the right was alone in the Lord; it was he that chose, appointed, and constituted their kings, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>; thus Saul, David, and Solomon, were chose and appointed by him, <a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>; it was not the person of Jeroboam chosen God disliked; but their taking it upon them to choose and set him up without his leave; <p>they have made princes, and knew it not; that is, they set up subordinate governors, judges, civil magistrates, elders of the people, over them, without his approbation, and such as were very disagreeable to him; otherwise he knew what was done by them, as being the omniscient God, but he did not approve of what they did. Some observe, that  in the word used, is put for  and should be rendered, "they have removed", so Jarchi and Japhet; that is, they have set up kings, and they have removed them; they have took it upon them to make and pose kings at pleasure, without seeking the Lord about it, when this is his prerogative, who is King of kings, and Lord of lords, <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; which sense makes a strong and beautiful antithesis; <p>of their silver and their gold have they made their idols; some of their idols were made of silver, others of gold; particularly the calves at Dan and Bethel, which are called the golden calves, because made of gold; as was the calf in the wilderness, <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>; see <a href="/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>; <p>that they may be cut off: which denotes not the end, intentions, and design of making these idols of silver and gold, but the event thereof; namely, either the destruction of the idols themselves, which, for the sake of the silver and gold they were made of; were cut in pieces by a foreign enemy; or the gold and silver were cut off from the people, their riches and wealth were wasted by such means; or rather the people were cut off, everyone of them, because of their worship of them, or this would be the case. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They have set up <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew <i>it</i> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</span><p>(c) That is, Jeroboam, by whom they sought their own liberty, and to obey my will.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. Israel’s great offence—making a schism in the ‘theocratic’ community.

There is a verbal contradiction between these words and those ascribed to Shemaiah in 2 Kings 12:24. A prophet could only declare the will of God with regard to the particular case laid before him. The disunion of north and south was so great, that for the sake of peace it was better to separate. But when the moral and spiritual decay of N. Israel had reached such a point as in the time of Hosea, no prophet with any spiritual insight could fail to perceive that the usurping kings lacked the divine blessing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that they may be cut off</span>] The verb is in the singular, and the implied subject is the silver and gold which had been made into idols.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not.</span> Here was the first instance and evidence of Israel's rejection of Jehovah. Their conduct was not guided by Divine direction, nor in obedience to the Divine will, nor with the Divine sanction. This state of things began with Israel's revolt from the house of David, and rebellion against the son of Solomon their legitimate sovereign, and was repeated in subsequent usurpations. Perhaps we may go further back, even to the appointment of the first king of the yet undivided kingdom, when "the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." Usurpations such as those of Zimri, Omri, and Shallum at least are comprehended in the appointments referred to - appointments on making which the people did not inquire of the Lord, nor act under his guidance, nor seek his sanction. Some go so far as to include all the kings of Israel that succeeded Jeroboam. Thus Cyril says, "He denies the kingdom of Israel and his successors on the throne of Israel." Aben Ezra also extends the statement to the kings of the northern kingdom from the days of Jeroboam: "They inquired not of God with respect to the making of Jeroboam king, although it is written, ' Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose.'" A seeming contradiction here exists between the statement of the prophet here and that in <a href="/1_kings/11-37.htm">1 Kings 11:37</a>, where God promises by the Prophet Ahijah, "I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel," and the fact of Jehu's anointing being ordered by the Prophet Elisha, who sent one of the children of the prophets for that purpose with the words, "Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel." The plotting of Jeroboam, and the conspiracy of Jehu against Joram, and the conspiracies of other usurpers, were things which God could not approve; and so we must distinguish between the permission and approval of Jehovah; in his government he permits many things which from his nature we know he does not and cannot approve. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> is usually and properly rendered, "they have made princes;" but Aben Ezra and Rashi translate it as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> equivalent to "they have removed;" while the Massora reckon <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span> in the number of those words which are written with <span class="accented">shin</span> but are read and explained with <span class="accented">samech</span>. Some manuscripts also of Kennicett and De Rossi have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>. Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they (literally, <span class="accented">it</span>) may be cut off. This is a second proof of Israel's renunciation of Jehovah. They used their gold in making the idolatrous calves, and their silver in supporting their idolatrous worship; or they made the idol-calves, some of silver, and others of gold. The consequence rather than the purpose is the destruction of it, namely, the gold and silver; or the ruin of the kingdom or of each member of it; or the cutting off of their name, according to Kimchi. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in Greek, is generally relic, denoting "purpose;" nor is it <span class="accented">ecbatic</span> here, denoting "result," though, according to the Hebrew mode of thought, design and consequence often coincide. Its meaning here is well explained by Keil, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> describes the consequence of this conduct, which, though not designed, was nevertheless inevitable, as if it had been distinctly intended." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This thought is expanded and proved in these verses. - <a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a>.
