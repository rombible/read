The Lord had caused his law to be written for them, but they cared not to know, and would not obey it. Man seems by the temples he builds to be mindful of his Maker, yet really he has forgotten him, because he has cast off all his fear; but none ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. So long as men despise the truths and precepts of God's word, and the ordinances of his worship, all the observances and offerings, however costly, of their own devising, will be unto them for sin; for those services only are acceptable to God, which are done according to his word, and through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of Mine offerings, and eat it; but the Lord accepteth them not - As they rejected God's law, so God rejected their "sacrifices," which were not offered according to His law. They, doubtless, thought much of their sacrifices; and this the prophet perhaps expresses by an intensive form ; "the sacrifices of My gifts, gifts," as though they thought, that they were ever giving. God accounted such sacrifices, not being hallowed by the end for which He instituted them, as mere "flesh." They "offered flesh" and "ate" it. Such was the beginning, and such the only end. "He" would "not accept them." Nay, contrariwise, "now," now while they were offering the sacrifices, God would show in deed that He "remembered" the sins, for which they were intended to atone. God seems to man to forget his sins, when He forbears to punish them; to "remember" them, when He punishes.<p>They shall return to Egypt - God had commanded them to return no more to Egypt <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> of their own mind. But He had threatened that, on their disobedience, "the Lord would bring them back to Egypt by the way, whereof He spake unto them, Thou shalt see it no more again" <a href="/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>. Hosea also foretells to them, that they (i. e., many of them) should go to Egypt and perish there <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, <a href="/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>. Thence also, as from Assyria, they were to be restored <a href="/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>.

The main part of the ten tribes were taken to Assyria, yet as they were, even under Hosea, conspiring with Egypt <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>, such as could, (it is likely) took refuge there. Else, as future deliverance, temporal or spiritual, is foretold under the image of the deliverance out of Egypt, so, contrariwise, the threat, "they shall return to Egypt," may be, in figure, a cancelling of the covenant, whereby God had promised, that His people should not return: a threat of renewed bondage, "like" the Egyptian; an abandonment of them to the state, from which God once had freed them and had made them His people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. sacrifices of mine offerings&#8212;that is, which they offer to Me.<p>eat it&#8212;Their own carnal gratification is the object which they seek, not My honor.<p>now&#8212;that is, "speedily."<p>shall return to Egypt&#8212;(Ho 9:3, 6; 11:11).

The interpretation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; of the high priest Onias III, who at the commencement of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes was driven from his office by his brother, and afterwards, at the instigation of Menelaus, was murdered by the Syrian governor Andronicus at Daphne near Antioch, 2 Macc. 4:1ff., 33ff. (Rosenmller, Hitzig, etc.) - this interpretation is not warranted by the facts of history. This murder does not at all relate to the matter before us, not only because the Jewish high priest at Antioch did not sustain the relation of a "prince of the covenant," but also because the murder was perpetrated without the previous knowledge of Antiochus, and when the matter was reported to him, the murderer was put to death by his command (2 Macc. 4:36-38). Thus also it stands in no connection with the war of Antiochus against Egypt. The words cannot also (with Hvernick, v. Leng., Maurer, Ebrard, Kliefoth) be referred to the Egyptian king Ptolemy Philometor, because history knows nothing of a covenant entered into between this king and Antiochus Epiphanes, but only that soon after the commencement of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes the guardians of the young Philometor demanded Coele-Syria from Antiochus, which Antiochus the Great had promised as a dowry to his daughter Cleopatra, who was betrothed to Ptolemy Philometor, but Antiochus did not deliver it up, and hence a war arose between them. To this is to be added, that, as Dereser, v. Lengerke, Maurer, and Kranichfeld have rightly remarked, the description in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22-24</a> bears an altogether general character, so that v. Leng. and Maurer find therein references to all the three expeditions of Antiochus, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25-27</a> find more fully foretold what is only briefly hinted at in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22-24</a>. The undertaking of the king against Egypt is first described in <a href="/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>. We must therefore, with Kranichfeld, understand &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; in undefined generality of covenant princes in general, in the sense already given.</body></html>
