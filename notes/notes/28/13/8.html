When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests.

It attacks flocks <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a>, and even oxen . The fierceness of the she-bear, "bereaved of her whelps," became a proverb (<a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a>; and here). : "They who have written on the nature of wild beasts, say that none is more savage than the she-bear, when she has lost her whelps or lacks food." It blends wonderfully most touching love and fierceness. It tenderly protects its wounded whelps, reckless of its life, so that it may bring them off, and it turns fiercely on their destroyer. Its love for them becomes fury against their injurer. Much more shall God avenge those who destroy His sons and daughters, leading and enticing them into sin and destruction of body and soul.<p>Rend the caul of - (what encloses) their heart that is, the pericardium. They had closed their hearts against God. Their punishment is pictured by the rending open of the closed heart, by the lion which is said to go instinctively straight to the heart, tears it out, and sucks the blood . Fearful will it be in the Day of Judgment, when the sinner's heart is laid open, with all the foul, cruel, malicious, defiled, thoughts which it harbored and concealed, against the will of God. "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>.<p>And there will I devour them - "There," where they sinned, shall they be punished. "The wild beast shall tear them." What God does, He does mostly through instruments, and what His instruments do, they do fulfilling His will through their own blind will or appetite. Hitherto, He had spoken, as being Himself their punisher, although laying aside, as it were, all His tenderness; now, lest the thought, that still it was He, the God of love who punished, should give them hope, He says, "the wild beast shall devour them." He gives them up, as it were, out of His own hands to the destroyer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The masculine undoubtedly occurs in <a href="/psalms/57-5.htm" title="Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be above all the earth.">Psalm 57:5</a> (Hebr.). The root-idea is probably voracity; but unfortunately there is no cognate in Assyrian. The numerous words for lion in Hebrew are as trouble-some to express in English, as the translators of the Sept. found them in Greek (Sept. here has <span class="greekheb">σκύμνοι δρυμοῦ</span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart.</span> The noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;</span> is epicene, that is, the one form serves for both genders, as here the masculine includes the feminine, and is used as such. Of all animals, Jerome says, the she-bear is the fiercest, either when robbed of her whelps or in want of food. <span class="accented">Seghor</span> being that which encloses the heart, is either the pericardium, the immediate and proper enclosure of the heart, or the breast itself. The reference is to a beast of prey which seizes its victim by the breast and tears it open, so that the heart is exposed. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e9;</span> is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e2;</span>, the meaning of the root-syllable <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;</span>, to meet, strike, being the same in both. Such is the continuation of the picture of the threatened punishment. The picture of the severity of the Divine judgment here presented is very terrible. Kimchi remarks on this picture: "A bear robbed, whose young ones they have slain, which is bereft and bitter in spirit, if it find man or beast rends it speedily." Some understand the verse figuratively, as though it meant "'I will rend their obstinate heart,' the enclosure of the heart being equivalent to a shut or obstinate heart, as, in ver. 5 of this same chapter, 'a land of drought' is pretty much the same as 'a dry or parched land.' Thus the Chaldee translates, 'I have broken the wickedness of their heart.'" <span class="cmt_word">And there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</span> <span class="accented">Sham</span> there refers <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to '<span class="accented">al-derekh</span> of the preceding verse; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as Kimchi explains it, as referring to their cities: "There in their cities shall I destroy them by pestilence and by the sword of the enemy, like the lion that teareth without pity;" or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> more simply still, "there on the spot." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, is the wild beast as opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, domestic animals. While some were to be destroyed by famine and pestilence, others would perish by the wild beast of the field. "Also," says Kimchi, "shall the wild beast of the field rend them outside (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. outside their cities), as, ' I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number.'" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And I betroth thee to myself for ever; and I betroth thee to myself in righteousness, and judgment, and in grace and pity. <a href="/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>. And I betroth thee to myself in faithfulness; and thou acknowledgest Jehovah." &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; &#1500;&#1493;, to betroth to one's self, to woo, is only applied to the wooing of a maiden, not to the restoration of a wife who has been divorced, and is generally distinguished from the taking of a wife (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-7.htm">Deuteronomy 20:7</a>). &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; therefore points, as Calvin observes, to an entirely new marriage. "It was indeed great grace for the unfaithful wife to be taken back again. She might in justice have been put away for ever. The only valid ground for divorce was there, since she had lived for years in adultery. But the grace of God goes further still. The past is not only forgiven, but it is also forgotten" (Hengstenberg). The Lord will now make a new covenant of marriage with His church, such as is made with a spotless virgin. This new and altogether unexpected grace He now directly announces to her: "I betroth thee to myself;" and repeats this promise three times in ever fresh terms, expressive of the indissoluble character of the new relation. This is involved in &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, "for ever," whereas the former covenant had been broken and dissolved by the wife's own guilt. In the clauses which follow, we have a description of the attributes which God would thereby unfold in order to render the covenant indissoluble. These are, (1) righteousness and judgment; (2) grace and compassion; (3) faithfulness. Tsedeq  equals  tseda&#770;qa&#770;h and mishpa&#770;t are frequently connected. Tsedeq, "being right," denotes subjective righteousness as an attribute of God or man; and mishpa&#770;t, objective right, whether in its judicial execution as judgment, or in its existence in actual fact. God betroths His church to Himself in righteousness and judgment, not by doing her justice, and faithfully fulfilling the obligations which He undertook at the conclusion of the covenant (Hengstenberg), but by purifying her, through the medium of just judgment, from all the unholiness and ungodliness that adhere to her still (<a href="/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>), that He may wipe out everything that can injure the covenant on the part of the church. But with the existing sinfulness of human nature, justice and judgment will not suffice to secure the lasting continuance of the covenant; and therefore God also promises to show mercy and compassion. But as even the love and compassion of God have their limits, the Lord still further adds, "in faithfulness or constancy," and thereby gives the promise that He will not more withdraw His mercy from her. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is also to be understood of the faithfulness of God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-25.htm">Psalm 89:25</a>, not of that of man (Hengstenberg). This is required by the parallelism of the sentences. In the faithfulness of God the church has a certain pledge, that the covenant founded upon righteousness and judgment, mercy and compassion, will stand for ever. The consequence of this union is, that the church knows Jehovah. This knowledge is "real." "He who knows God in this way, cannot fail to love Him, and be faithful to Him" (Hengstenberg); for out of this covenant there flows unconquerable salvation. </body></html>
