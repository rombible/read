When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests. Abused goodness calls for greater severity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud - There is often a fair show of prosperity, out of God; but it is short-lived. "The third generation," says the pagan proverb, "never enjoys the ill-gotten gain." The highest prosperity of an ungodly state is often the next to its fall. Israel never so flourished, as under Jeroboam II. Bright and glistening with light is "the early dew;" in an hour it is gone, as if it had never been. Glowing and gilded by the sun is "the morning cloud;" while you admire its beauty, its hues have vanished. "The chaff" lay in one heap "on the floor" with the wheat. Its owner casts the mingled chaff and wheat against the strong wind; in a moment, it is "driven by the wind out of the floor." While every gram falls to the ground, the chaff, light, dry, worthless, unsubstantial, is hurried along, unresisting, the sport of the viewless wind, and itself is soon seen no more. The "smoke," one, seemingly solid, full, lofty, column, ascendeth, swelleth, welleth, vanisheth . In form, it is as solid, when about to be dispersed and seen no more, as when it first issued "out of the chimney." : "It is raised aloft, and by that very uplifting swells into a vast globe; but the larger that globe is, the emptier, for from that unsolid, unbased, inflated greatness it vanisheth in air, so that its very greatness injures it. For the more it is uplifted, extended, diffused on all sides into a larger compass, so much the poorer it becometh, and faileth, and disappeareth." Such was the prosperity of Ephraim, a mere show, to vanish forever. In the image of "the chaff," the prophet substitutes the "whirlwind" for the wind by which the Easterns used to winnow, in order to picture the violence with which they should be whirled away from their own land.<p>While these four emblems, in common, picture what is fleeting, two, the "early dew" and the "morning cloud," are emblems of what is in itself good, but passing ; the two others, the chaff and the smoke, are emblems of what is worthless. The dew and the cloud were temporary mercies on the part of God which should cease from them, "good in themselves, but to their evil, soon to pass away." If the dew have not, in its brief space, refreshed the vegetation, no trace of it is left. It gives way to the burning sun. If grace have not done its work in the soul, its day is gone. Such dew were the many prophets vouchsafed to Israel; such was Hosea himself, most brilliant, but soon to pass away. The chaff was the people itself, to be carried out of the Lord's land; the smoke, "its pride and its errors, whose disappearance was to leave the air pure for the household of God." : "So it is written; 'As the smoke is driven away, so shalt thou drive' them 'away; as wax melteth before the fire, so shall the ungodly perish before the presence of God' <a href="/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>; and in Proverbs; 'As the whirlwind passeth' <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a>, so is 'the wicked no' more; 'but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.' Who although they live and flourish, as to the life of the body; yet spiritually they die, yea, and are brought to nothing, for by sin man became a nothing. Virtue makes man upright and stable; vice, empty and unstable. Whence Isaiah says, 'the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest' <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>; and Job; 'If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away; then shalt thou be steadfast.' <a href="//biblehub.com/job/11-14.htm">Job 11:14-15</a>." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. they shall be as the morning cloud &#8230; dew&#8212;(Ho 6:4).

Their irrational and God-dishonoring conduct was bringing on them sure and swift destruction. The prophet employs four figures to exhibit their political extinction. Two of these, the morning cloud and early dew, or rather the dew early passing away, have already been employed by him to characterize the transient nature of Israel's goodness; here they denote the evanescent nature of their national existence. The other two are the chaff and the smoke; the former whirled away by the storm-wind from the threshing-floor, the latter dissipated and speedily vanishing as soon as it escapes from the chimney or lattice. Such shall be the utter extermination of Israel. The senselessness of their idolatry had been treated with derision in the preceding verse; the punishment of their sin is sternly denounced in this. Kimchi comments concisely and correctly thus: "Therefore they shall go to destruction, and shall be as the morning cloud, or as the dew speedily disappearing in the morning, width vanishes when the heat of the sun has touched it; so they shall go away speedily. So also shall they be as chaff - it is the fine particles of straw, which the wind whirls away from the threshing-floor; thus shall they be whirled away from their land. Or as a pillar of smoke which goes forth out of the lattice, which shall speedily disperse and cease."

In two strophes we have first the promise of their conversion (<a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14-17</a>), and secondly, the assurance of the renewal of the covenant mercies (<a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18-23</a>). <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>. "Therefore, behold, I allure her, and lead her into the desert, and speak to her heart. And I give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor (of tribulation) for the door of hope; and she answers thither, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt." &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, therefore (not utique, profecto, but, nevertheless, which la&#770;khe&#772;n in <a href="/hosea/2-6.htm">Hosea 2:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-9.htm">Hosea 2:9</a>, and is connected primarily with the last clause of <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>. "Because the wife has forgotten God, He calls Himself to her remembrance again, first of all by punishment (<a href="/hosea/2-6.htm">Hosea 2:6</a> and <a href="/hosea/2-9.htm">Hosea 2:9</a>); then, when this has answered its purpose, and after she has said, I will go and return (<a href="/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>), by the manifestations of His love" (Hengstenberg). That the first clause of <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a> does not refer to the flight of the people out of Canaan into the desert, for the purpose of escaping from their foes, as Hitzig supposes, is sufficiently obvious to need no special proof. The alluring of the nation into the desert to lead it thence to Canaan, presupposes that rejection from the inheritance given to it by the Lord (viz., Canaan), which Israel had brought upon itself through its apostasy. This rejection is represented as an expulsion from Canaan to Egypt, the land of bondage, out of which Jehovah had redeemed it in the olden time. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, in the piel to persuade, to decoy by words; here sensu bono, to allure by friendly words. The desert into which the Lord will lead His people cannot be any other than the desert of Arabia, through which the road from Egypt to Canaan passes. Leading into this desert is not a punishment, but a redemption out of bondage. The people are not to remain in the desert, but to be enticed and led through it to Canaan, the land of vineyards. The description is typical throughout. What took place in the olden time is to be repeated, in all that is essential, in the time to come. Egypt, the Arabian desert, and Canaan are types. Egypt is a type of the land of captivity, in which Israel had been oppressed in its fathers by the heathen power of the world. The Arabian desert, as the intervening stage between Egypt and Canaan, is introduced here, in accordance with the importance which attached to the march of Israel through this desert under the guidance of Moses, as a period or state of probation and trial, as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-6</a>, in which the Lord humbled His people, training it on the one hand by want and privation to the knowledge of its need of help, and on the other hand by miraculous deliverance in the time of need (e.g., the manna, the stream of water, and the preservation of their clothing) to trust to His omnipotence, that He might awaken within it a heartfelt love to the fulfilment of His commandments and a faithful attachment to Himself. Canaan, the land promised to the fathers as an everlasting possession, with its costly productions, is a type of the inheritance bestowed by the Lord upon His church, and of blessedness in the enjoyment of the gifts of the Lord which refresh both body and soul. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1489;, to speak to the heart, as applied to loving, comforting words (<a href="/genesis/34-3.htm">Genesis 34:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/50-21.htm">Genesis 50:21</a>, etc.), is not to be restricted to the comforting addresses of the prophets, but denotes a comforting by action, by manifestations of love, by which her grief is mitigated, and the broken heart is healed. The same love is shown in the renewed gifts of the possessions of which the unfaithful nation had been deprived.<p>In this way we obtain a close link of connection for <a href="/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>. By &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501; ... &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "I give from thence," i.e., from the desert onwards, the thought is expressed, that on entering the promised land Israel would be put into immediate possession and enjoyment of its rich blessings. Manger has correctly explained &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501; as meaning "as soon as it shall have left this desert," or better still, "as soon as it shall have reached the border." "Its vineyards" are the vineyards which it formerly possessed, and which rightfully belonged to the faithful wife, though they had been withdrawn from the unfaithful (<a href="/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>). The valley of Achor, which was situated to the north of Gilgal and Jericho (see at <a href="/joshua/7-26.htm">Joshua 7:26</a>), is mentioned by the prophet, not because of its situation on the border of Palestine, nor on account of its fruitfulness, of which nothing is known, but with an evident allusion to the occurrence described in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, from which it obtained its name of &#8219;Akho&#772;r, Troubling. This is obvious from the declaration that this valley shall become a door of hope. Through the sin of Achan, who took some of the spoil of Jericho which had been devoted by the ban to the Lord, Israel had fallen under the ban, so that the Lord withdrew His help, and the army that marched against Ai was defeated. But in answer to the prayer of Joshua and the elders, God showed to Joshua not only the cause of the calamity which had befallen the whole nation, but the means of escaping from the ban and recovering the lost favour of God. Through the name Achor this valley became a memorial, how the Lord restores His favour to the church after the expiation of the guilt by the punishment of the transgressor. And this divine mode of procedure will be repeated in all its essential characteristics. The Lord will make the valley of troubling a door of hope, i.e., He will so expiate the sins of His church, and cover them with His grace, that the covenant of fellowship with Him will no more be rent asunder by them; or He will so display His grace to the sinners, that compassion will manifest itself even in wrath, and through judgment and mercy the pardoned sinners will be more and more firmly and inwardly united to Him. And the church will respond to this movement on the part of the love of God, which reveals itself in justice and mercy. It will answer to the place, whence the Lord comes to meet it with the fulness of His saving blessings. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; does not mean "to sing," but "to answer;" and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, pointing back to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;, must not be regarded as equivalent to &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;. As the comforting address of the Lord is a sermo realis, so the answer of the church is a practical response of grateful acknowledgment and acceptance of the manifestations of divine love, just as was the case in the days of the nation's youth, i.e., in the time when it was led up from Egypt to Canaan. Israel then answered the Lord, after its redemption from Egypt, by the song of praise and thanksgiving at the Red Sea (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>), and by its willingness to conclude the covenant with the Lord at Sinai, and to keep His commandments (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>). </body></html>
