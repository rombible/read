When Ephraim forsook God, and followed idolatry, he sunk. Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves, in token of their adoration of them, affection for them, and obedience to them; but the Lord will not give his glory to another, and therefore all that worship images shall be confounded. No solid, lasting comfort, is to be expected any where but in God. God not only took care of the Israelites in the wilderness, he put them in possession of Canaan, a good land; but worldly prosperity, when it feeds men's pride, makes them forgetful of God. Therefore the Lord would meet them in just vengeance, as the most terrible beast that inhabited their forests.

Their wealth which they were proud of, which they abused, allured their enemies. To cut off all hopes of God's mercy, He says that he will be to them, as those creatures of His, which never spare. The fierceness of the lion, and the swiftness of the leopard, together portray a speedy inexorable chastisement. But what a contrast I He who bare Israel in the wilderness like a Father, who bare them on eagle's wings, who drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love, He, the God of mercy and of love, their Father, Protector, Defender, Avenger, He it is who will be their destroyer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

By this and the following metaphors are set forth the severity of God's judgments upon them for their sins, and their utter destruction by them. Some observe the word (f) here used signifies an old lion, which, though slower in the pursuit of its prey, is more cruel when it has got it; see <a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>; <p>as a leopard by the way will I observe them; which is a quick sighted, vigilant, crafty, and insidious creature, which lurks in trees, and watches for men and beasts that pass by the way, and seizes on them. The lion makes his onset more openly, this more secretly; and both express the various ways God would take in his providence to chastise these people for their sins, and that he would watch over them to do them hurt, as he had to do them good, and take the proper opportunity of doing it, and execute his purpose with great wrath and fury, to their utter ruin; see <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "as a leopard by the way of Assyria" (g), or "the Assyrians"; and so some interpreters take the sense to be, that God would watch them in their way to Assyria for help, and blast their designs, disappoint them of their expected assistance, and surprise them with his judgments; see <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>; and there was a mountain in Syria, called the mountain of the leopards, where they used to haunt, and from whence they came out to take their prey, to which there is a reference in Sol 4:8; which was two miles from Tripoli (a city of Syria) northward, three from the city Arces southward, and one from Mount Lebanon (h); and such is the vigilance and agility of leopards, that they will sometimes, as Pliny (i) says, mount thick trees, and hide themselves in the branches, and leap at once, and unawares, upon those that pass by, whether men or beasts, as before observed; wherefore, with great propriety, is this simile used.

So also Hitzig and Ewald. But the prophet has to deal now with the disease itself, not with a mere symptom.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - These verses teach that the result of their sins is inevitable destruction, and that Jehovah, merciful and gracious though he is, has now divested himself of all compassion on them. The appropriateness of the terrible figures here employed arises from the fact that Israel had been compared in the previous verse to a flock fed and filled in a luxuriant pasture; the punishment of that flock is now fitly compared to "the tearing in pieces and devouring of that fattened flock by wild beasts." The beasts in question are a lion, a leopard, a bear, a lioness, and fierce wild beasts in general. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I will be unto them as a lion.</span> The verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is the future changed into the preterit or past tense by <span class="accented">vav</span> consecutive, and marks the consequence of forgetting God. So Aben Ezra: "The preterit in reference to the evils which Jehovah brought upon them." While the past thus implies that the punishment has commenced, the futures which follow denote its continuance. Rosenm&uuml;ller regards the preterit here as prophetic and continuative, and paraphrases the meaning by, "I have at length become and have been, and shall continue to be to them." He considers the reference of the preterit to be to past disasters, especially the various defeats sustained by Israel at the hand of the Syrians (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>) and the Assyrians (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). He also very aptly compares <a href="/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7-10</a> in relation to the subject in hand. The Prophet Isaiah, after relating the loving-kindnesses of the Lord and his praises and his great goodness to the house of Israel on the one hand, and their rebellion and vexing his Holy Spirit on the other hand, adds, "Therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them." <span class="cmt_word">As a leopard by the way will I observe them.</span> The lion and the leopard are frequently conjoined, as animals of like natural ferocity, by the ancients both in sacred and secular writings. The outlook on the way is for the purpose of springing upon the passers-by. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> is properly <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the future of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, to look around, and thence, to lie in wait; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some, taking the initial <span class="accented">aleph</span> as radical and the word as participle of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, translate it by "<span class="accented">trodden</span> way," that is, away trodden and frequented by men and animals. The LXX. and Vulgate again, also Jerome, Hitzig, and Ewald, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> translate it by" <span class="accented">on the way</span> of the Assyrians," either referring to the time when they would be led captive by the Assyrians or when they persisted in going thither to sue for aid. But the name of Assyria is always written <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, as Rashi rightly observes: "In every place where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;</span> occurs in Scripture (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as a proper name) it has daghesh (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in the <span class="accented">shin</span>); yet here it has raphe, [to show] that it is not the name of a place, but a verb: 'I observe and keep watch,' as 'I shall observe him, but not nigh' (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>)." Kimchi explains the verse as follows: "Because they have forgotten me, I also have rejected them, and have left them in the hand of the peoples; and have become to them like a lion or leopard, which observes the way, and is prepared to tear whatever passes by it on the way. Just so have I been to them, for I have caused their enemies to rule over them, and they have not had power to deliver themselves from their hand until they returned to me, and I took pity upon them." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And I betroth thee to myself for ever; and I betroth thee to myself in righteousness, and judgment, and in grace and pity. <a href="/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>. And I betroth thee to myself in faithfulness; and thou acknowledgest Jehovah." &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; &#1500;&#1493;, to betroth to one's self, to woo, is only applied to the wooing of a maiden, not to the restoration of a wife who has been divorced, and is generally distinguished from the taking of a wife (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-7.htm">Deuteronomy 20:7</a>). &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; therefore points, as Calvin observes, to an entirely new marriage. "It was indeed great grace for the unfaithful wife to be taken back again. She might in justice have been put away for ever. The only valid ground for divorce was there, since she had lived for years in adultery. But the grace of God goes further still. The past is not only forgiven, but it is also forgotten" (Hengstenberg). The Lord will now make a new covenant of marriage with His church, such as is made with a spotless virgin. This new and altogether unexpected grace He now directly announces to her: "I betroth thee to myself;" and repeats this promise three times in ever fresh terms, expressive of the indissoluble character of the new relation. This is involved in &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, "for ever," whereas the former covenant had been broken and dissolved by the wife's own guilt. In the clauses which follow, we have a description of the attributes which God would thereby unfold in order to render the covenant indissoluble. These are, (1) righteousness and judgment; (2) grace and compassion; (3) faithfulness. Tsedeq  equals  tseda&#770;qa&#770;h and mishpa&#770;t are frequently connected. Tsedeq, "being right," denotes subjective righteousness as an attribute of God or man; and mishpa&#770;t, objective right, whether in its judicial execution as judgment, or in its existence in actual fact. God betroths His church to Himself in righteousness and judgment, not by doing her justice, and faithfully fulfilling the obligations which He undertook at the conclusion of the covenant (Hengstenberg), but by purifying her, through the medium of just judgment, from all the unholiness and ungodliness that adhere to her still (<a href="/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>), that He may wipe out everything that can injure the covenant on the part of the church. But with the existing sinfulness of human nature, justice and judgment will not suffice to secure the lasting continuance of the covenant; and therefore God also promises to show mercy and compassion. But as even the love and compassion of God have their limits, the Lord still further adds, "in faithfulness or constancy," and thereby gives the promise that He will not more withdraw His mercy from her. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; is also to be understood of the faithfulness of God, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-25.htm">Psalm 89:25</a>, not of that of man (Hengstenberg). This is required by the parallelism of the sentences. In the faithfulness of God the church has a certain pledge, that the covenant founded upon righteousness and judgment, mercy and compassion, will stand for ever. The consequence of this union is, that the church knows Jehovah. This knowledge is "real." "He who knows God in this way, cannot fail to love Him, and be faithful to Him" (Hengstenberg); for out of this covenant there flows unconquerable salvation. </body></html>
