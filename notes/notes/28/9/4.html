It is common for those who are niggardly in religion, to be prodigal upon their lusts. Those are reckoned as idolaters, who love a reward in the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and in eternal life. They are full of the joy of harvest, and have no disposition to mourn for sin. When we make the world, and the things of it, our idol and our portion, it is just with God to show us our folly, and correct us. None may expect to dwell in the Lord's land, who will not be subject to the Lord's laws, or be influenced by his love. When we enjoy the means of grace, we ought to consider what we shall do, if they should be taken from us. While the pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of change, the pleasant places purchased with silver, or in which men deposit silver, are liable to be laid in ruins.

The burnt-offering (and with it the meal and the wine-offering,) was "the" daily morning and evening sacrifice <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-41</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-8</a>, and the sacrifice of the Sabbath <a href="/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>. It was offered, together with the sin-offering, on the first of the month, the Passover, the feast of the first-fruits, of trumpets, of tabernacles, and the Day of Atonement, besides the special sacrifices of that day <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15-16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-22.htm">Numbers 28:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>, <a href="/numbers/28-30.htm">Numbers 28:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-11.htm">Numbers 29:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1-2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-5.htm">Numbers 29:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7-8</a>, 12-38. It entered also into private life <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>, <a href="/numbers/15-10.htm">Numbers 15:10</a>. The drink-offering accompanied also the peace-offering <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8</a>, <a href="/numbers/15-10.htm">Numbers 15:10</a>. As the burnt-offering, on which the offerer laid his hand <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>, and which was wholly consumed by the sacred fire which at first fell from heaven, expressed the entire self-devotion of the offerer, that he owed himself wholly to his God; and as the peace-offering was the expression of thankfulness, which was at peace with God; so the outpouring of the wine betokened the joy, which accompanies that entire self oblation, that thankfulness in self-oblation of a soul accepted by God. In denying, then, that Israel should "offer wine-offerings," the prophet says, that all the joy of their service of God, nay all their public service should cease. As he had before said, that they should be "for many days without sacrifice" <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-4.htm">Leviticus 3:4</a>, so now, he says, in fact, that they should live without the prescribed means of pleading to God the atonement to come. Whence he adds,<p>Neither shall they be pleasing to the Lord - For they should no longer have the means prescribed for reconciliation with God. Such is the state of Israel now. God appointed one way of reconciliation with Himself, the Sacrifice of Christ. Sacrifice pictured this, and pleaded it to Him, from the fall until Christ Himself "appeared, once in the end of the world, to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself" <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>. Soon after, when time had been given to the Jews to learn to acknowledge Him, all bloody sacrifices ceased. Since then the Jews have lived without that means of reconciliation, which God appointed. It availed, not in itself, but as being appointed lay God to foreshadow and plead that one sacrifice. So He who, by our poverty and void, awakens in us the longing for Himself, would through the anomalous condition, to which He has, by the orderings of His divine providence, brought His former people, call forth in them that sense of need, which would bring them to Christ. In their half-obedience, they remain under the ceremonial law which He gave them, although He called them, and still calls them, to exchange the shadow for the substance in Christ. But in that they cannot fulfill the requirements of the law, even in its outward form, the law, which they acknowledge, bears witness to them, that they are not living according to the mind of God.<p>Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners - He had said that they should not sacrifice to God, when no longer in the Lord's land. He adds that, if they should attempt it, their sacrifices, so far from being a means of acceptance, should be defiled, and a source of defilement to them. "All" which was "in" the same "tent" or house with a dead body, was "unclean for seven days" <a href="/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14</a>. The bread, which they ate then, was defiled. If "one unclean by a dead body touched bread or pottage or any meat, it was unclean" <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12-13</a>. In offering the tithes, a man was commanded to declare, "I have not eaten of it in my mourning" <a href="/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>. So would God impress on the soul the awfulness of death, and man's sinfulness, of which death is the punishment. He does not say, that they would offer sacrifices, but that their sacrifices, if offered as God did not command, would defile, not atone. It is in truman nature, to neglect to serve God, when He wills it, and then to attempt to serve Him when he forbids it. Thus Israel, affrighted by the report of the spies <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>, would not go up to the promised land, when God commanded it. When God had sentenced them, not to go up, but to die in the wilderness, "then" they attempted it. Sacrifice, according to God's law, could only be offered in the promised land. In their captivity, then, it would be a fresh sin.<p>For their bread for their soul - Or "is for their soul," i. e., "for themselves;" it is for whatever use they can make of it for this life's needs, to support life. Nothing of it would be admitted "into the house of the Lord," as offered to Him or accepted by Him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. offer wine offerings&#8212;literally, "pour as a libation (Ex 30:9; Le 23:13).<p>neither shall they be pleasing unto him&#8212;as being offered on a profane soil.<p>sacrifices &#8230; as the bread of mourners&#8212;which was unclean (De 26:14; Jer 16:7; Eze 24:17).<p>their bread for their soul&#8212;their offering for the expiation of their soul [Calvin], (Le 17:11).

The clause is therefore equivalent to this—‘The wine that they drink shall not be pleasing to the Lord’; comp. the following words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither shall they be pleasing</span> (lit. sweet) <span class="ital">unto him</span>] Strangely enough, the accentuation of the text separates between the verb and its subject; the Sept., Targ., and Peshito preserve the obviously right view of the construction, <span class="bld">neither shall their sacrifices be pleasing unto him</span>. The peculiar accentuation was possibly caused by a wish to preclude a misinterpretation of Hosea’s language, viz. that the Israelites would go on sacrificing to Jehovah even when in captivity. But the truth is that the Hebrew <span class="ital">zébakh</span> (like <span class="greekheb">ἱερεῖον</span>, see Mahaffy’s <span class="ital">Old Greek Life</span>, p. 32) has a twofold meaning: 1, a sacrifice, and 2, a feast of animal food. Fleshmeat was not the habitual food of the Israelites, any more than it is of the Arabs at the present day; to partake of it was a special divinely given privilege (comp. <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm" title="Every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.">Genesis 9:3</a>), and those who from time to time availed themselves of this privilege had to make an acknowledgment of it by presenting, at the very least, the blood before Jehovah (comp. <a href="/context/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood....">1 Samuel 14:32-35</a>). The Book of Leviticus (<a href="/context/leviticus/17-3.htm" title="What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that kills it out of the camp,...">Leviticus 17:3-4</a>) prescribes that the blood of all slain beasts should be offered to Jehovah at the door of the tabernacle, and though a milder rule is given in Deuteronomy (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart....">Deuteronomy 12:15-16</a>), yet, from what we know of the religious habits of the people, we may safely assume that not only did they worship Jehovah at the ‘high places’, but they also in one way or another presented any animal food of which they partook at the local shrines, as well as at the central sanctuary. Hence we may very probably lay down that in old Hebrew as in old Greek life the conceptions of sacrifice (and presenting the blood was a minor kind of sacrificial act) and of feasting upon animal food were inseparable; indeed, we find in the semi-secular Book of Proverbs two synonymous proverbs, in one of which a feast is described as ‘a stalled ox’, and in the other as ‘sacrifices’ (comp. <a href="/proverbs/15-17.htm" title="Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.">Proverbs 15:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-1.htm" title="Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.">Proverbs 17:1</a>). Consequently, we might, in the clause before us, with equal justice render ‘neither shall their sacrifices’, and ‘neither shall their feasts (i.e. meat-meals) be pleasing unto him.’ It must be admitted, however, that the sense is improved if, with Kuenen, we alter a <span class="ital">Beth</span> into a <span class="ital">Caph</span>, and render, <span class="bld">neither shall they lay out their sacrifices before him</span> (upon the altar); comp. <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>. Such a mistake in the reading of the text would escape notice the more easily, because the phrase produced by it is so idiomatic (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a><span class="ital"> b</span>). If we accept this emendation, all that has been said on the connexion of sacrificing and feasting will still retain its explanatory value. We may illustrate this connexion further by <a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm" title="And, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh, and drink blood.">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, where Ezekiel is bidden to invite ‘every feathered fowl’ to the ‘sacrifice’ (so A.V.) that Jehovah doth ‘sacrifice for them’; ‘sacrifice’ (<span class="ital">zébakh</span>) is here evidently equivalent to ‘feast’ (in the sense described above).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">their sacrifices … mourners</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">(their bread) shall be unto them as the bread of mourning</span>; the first two words seem to have fallen out of the text. ‘Bread of mourning’ means such as was eaten during the seven days of mourning, when everything in the vicinity of the dead body was regarded as unclean (<a href="/numbers/19-14.htm" title="This is the law, when a man dies in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:14</a>); it is therefore the emblem of utter impurity. Or there may possibly be a more special reference to the funeral feasts, which lingered on among the Israelites, as St Jerome has noticed (see his note on <a href="/jeremiah/16-7.htm" title="Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.">Jeremiah 16:7</a> and see <a href="/deuteronomy/26-14.htm" title="I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have listened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me.">Deuteronomy 26:14</a>), but which are to be distinguished from the offerings made at intervals (in Sirach’s time) at the grave (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/7-33.htm" title="A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and for the dead detain it not.">Sir 7:33</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/30-18.htm" title="Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meat set upon a grave.">Sir 30:18</a>). See Ewald, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span>, E. T., p. 153, Renouf, <span class="ital">Hibbert Lectures</span>, p. 132, Tylor, <span class="ital">Primitive Culture</span>, ii. 27.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for their bread for their soul</span> …] Rather, <span class="bld">for their bread shall be (only) for their hunger</span> (i.e. to satisfy their appetite); <span class="bld">it shall not come into the house of the Lord</span>. They will not have the joy which belongs to those who have duly presented the tithes of their corn, or the firstlings of their flock, or offered their burnt sacrifices—the joy of the sense of the divine favour. They cannot have this, because their food lacks the consecration of ‘the house of the Lord’ (not the temple at Jerusalem, but any of the ‘high places’ dedicated to Jehovah).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them the broad of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted</span>. Having predicted their inability to observe the ritual distinctions between clean and unclean, which the Law prescribed, whether from the tyranny of their oppressors or from scarcity, or from the absence of sanctification by the presentation of the firstfruits, the prophet proceeds to predict their cessation altogether. Such is the prophet's picture of their miserable position in Assyria. It is aptly remarked by Grotius that "they failed to pour out libations to the Lord when they could; now the time shall come when they may wish to make such libations, but cannot." According to the Massoretic punctuation and the common rendering, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> which is that of the Authorized Version, the people themselves are the subject of the second verb. They were neither able to offer drink offerings, a part for the whole of the meat offerings and unbloody oblations; nor, if they did, could they hope for acceptance for them away from the sanctuary and its central altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig supplies <span class="accented">niskeyhens</span>, their drink offerings, from the foregoing clause, as subject to the verb of the following one, and the verb is explained by some in the sense of "mire." If <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we neglect the <span class="accented">segholta</span>, and make <span class="accented">zibh</span>-<span class="accented">chehem</span> the subject, the meaning is clearer, and the contrast between the unbloody and bloody offerings more obvious; thus: "They will not pour out libations of wine to Jehovah, nor will their sacrifices [equivalent to 'bloody oblations'] please him," that is to say, not such as were actually offered, but such as they might feel dis. posed to offer. The same noun may be repeated in next clause; thus, their sacrifices, or rather slaughtered meats, are unto him as bread of mourners, or, what is better, <span class="accented">their food</span> (supplied from <span class="accented">ke</span> <span class="accented">lechem</span>) <span class="accented">shall be unto them like bread of mourners</span>. Mourners' bread is that eaten at a funeral feast, or meal by persons mourning for the dead, and which was legally unclean, since a corpse defiled the house in which it was and all who entered it for seven days, as we read in <a href="/numbers/19-14.htm">Numbers 19:14</a>, "This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days." Of course, all who partook of the food would be polluted; so with that of Israel in exile, being unsanctified by the offering of firstfruits. <span class="cmt_word">For their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord.</span> "Their bread for their soul," that is, for appeasing their appetite, whatsoever their soul lusted after, or bread for the preservation of their life, would not come into the house of the Lord to be sanctified by representative offerings. <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord?</span> On such occasions they would feel the misery of their position most keenly. Away in a far foreign land, without temple and without ritual, they would bewail the loss of their annual celebrations, their national festivals and religious solemnities - those holiday-times of general joy and spiritual gladness. The distinction between <span class="accented">moed</span> and <span class="accented">chag</span> is variously given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> By Grotius and Rosenm&uuml;ller mood is referred to one of the three annual feasts - Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles; and chug to any of the other feasts, including the new moon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others restrict <span class="accented">chag</span> to the Feast of Tabernacles, or harvest festival, the most joyous of them all. Keil makes the words synonymous, except that in <span class="accented">chag</span> festival joy is made prominent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Here then is described how the two kings seek through feigned friendship to destroy one another. The two kings are of course the two kings of the north and the south previously named. Of a third, namely, of two kings of Egypt, Philometor and Physkon, Daniel knows nothing. The third, Physkon, is introduced from history; and hence Hitzig, v. Lengerke, and others understand by the "two kings," the two kings Antiochus and Philometor confederated against the king of the south, but Kliefoth, on the contrary, thinks of Antiochus and Physkon, the latter of whom he regards as the king of the south, <a href="/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a>. All this is arbitrary. Jerome has already rejected the historical evidence for this, and remarks: verum ex eo, quia scriptura nunc dicit: duos fuisse reges, quorum cor fuerit fraudulentum ... hoc secundum historiam demonstrari non potest. &#1500;&#1502;&#1512;&#1506; &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1501; Hitzig translates: "their heart belongs to wickedness," contrary to the context. &#1500; denotes also here only the direction: "their heart goes toward wicked deeds," is directed thereto. &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; (from &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;), formed after &#1502;&#1510;&#1512; (cf. Ewald, 160a), the evil-doing, consists in this, that the one seeks to overthrow and destroy the other under the cloak of feigned friendship; for they eat as friends at one table, and "speak lies" - the one tells lies to the other, professing friendship. But their design shall not succeed. All interpretations of these words which are determined by historical facta are arbitrary. The history of Antiochus Epiphanes furnishes no illustrations for this. In the sense of the prophecy &#1514;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; &#1500;&#1488; has only this meaning: the design of the king of the north to destroy the king of the south, and to make himself master both of the north and the south, shall not succeed, and the king of the south will not fulfil what he promises to his deceitful adversary. For yet the end shall be at the time appointed. These words state the reason why the &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; shall not succeed. Hitzig incorrectly translates: "but the end holds onwards to the appointed time;" for &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; cannot in this connection be rendered by but, and &#1500; cannot express the idea of holding to anything. &#1500; denotes here, as generally, the direction toward the end, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>. The end goes yet on to the time appointed by God. That this &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; (appointment of time) does not lie in the present, but in the future, is denoted by &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;, although we do not, with Hvernick, interpret &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; by "for the end lies yet further out," nor, with v. Lengerke and Maurer, may we supply the verb "withdraws itself, is reserved." &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; stands before &#1511;&#1509; because on it the emphasis lies. &#1511;&#1509; is, however, not the end of the war between Antiochus and Egypt (v. Leng., Maur., Hitzig), but cannot be otherwise taken than &#1511;&#1509; &#1506;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>, and <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>. But in the latter passage &#1511;&#1509; &#1506;&#1514; is the time of the resurrection of the dead, thus the end of the present course of the world, with which all the oppression of the people of God ceases. Accordingly &#1511;&#1509; in the verse before us, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>, is the time in which the conduct of the kings previously described, in their rising up and in their hostility against the people of God, reaches its end (<a href="/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>); and with the overthrow of these enemies the period of oppression also comes to an end. This end comes only &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, at the time which God has determined for the purifying of His people (<a href="/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>). So long may the kings of the north and the south prosecute their aims; so long shall they strive for the possession of the kingdom without succeeding in their plans. &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; has here and in <a href="/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a> the definite article, because in both verses the language refers not to any definite time, but to the time determined by God for the consummation of His kingdom. The placing of the article in this word in the verse before us is not, with Kliefoth, to be explained from a reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>, <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>. The two revelations are separated from each other by too long a space of time for this one to refer back to that earlier one by the mere use of the article, although both treat of the same subject. The &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; occurs besides in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-29.htm">Daniel 11:29</a>, where it is natural to suppose that it has the same meaning as here; but the contents of the verse oppose such a conclusion. <a href="/daniel/11-29.htm">Daniel 11:29</a> treats, it is true, of a renewed warlike expedition against the south, which, however, brings neither the final deciding of the war with the south (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a>), nor yet the end of the oppression of the people of God; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; is thus only the time determined for the second aggression against the south, not the time of the end. </body></html>
