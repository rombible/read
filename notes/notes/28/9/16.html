God departs from a people, or from a person, when he withdraws his goodness and mercy from them; and when the Lord is departed, what can the creature do? Even though, for the present, good things seem to remain, yet the blessing is gone if God is gone. Even the children should perish with the parents. The Divine wrath dries up the root, and withers the fruit of all comforts; and the scattered Jews daily warn us to beware, lest we neglect or abuse the gospel. Yet every smiting is not a drying up of the root. It may be that God intends only to smite so that the sap may be turned to the root, that there may be more of root graces, more humility, patience, faith, and self-denial. It is very just that God should bring judgments on those who slight his offered mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ephraim is smitten - The prophet, under the image of a tree, repeats the same sentence of God upon Israel. The word "smitten" is used of the smiting of the tree from above, especially by the visitation of God, as by "blasting" and "mildew" <a href="/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>. Yet such smiting, although it falls heavily for the time, leaves hope for the future. He adds then, "their root is" also "withered," so that "they should bear no fruit;" or if, perchance, while the root was still drying up and not quite dead, any fruit he yet found, "yet will I slay," God says, "the beloved," fruit "of their womb," the desired fruit of their bodies, that which their souls longed for. : "So long as they have children, and multiply the fruit of the womb, they think that they bear fruit, they deem not that "their root is dried," or that they have been severed by the axe of excision, and "rooted out of the land of the living;" but, in the anguish at the "slaying" of those they most loved, they shall say, better had it been to have had no children." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The people of the ten tribes, the kingdom of Israel, who had been like a tree planted in a pleasant place, <a href="/hosea/9-13.htm">Hosea 9:13</a>; and were in very flourishing circumstances in the times of Jeroboam the second; but now were like a tree smitten with thunder and lightning, or hail stones, and beat to pieces; or with the heat of the sun, or with blasting winds, or by worms; as in the succeeding reigns, by the judgments of God upon them; by civil wars, conspiracies, and murders among themselves; and by the exactions of Pul and depredations of Tiglathpileser kings of Assyria; and quickly would be smitten again; the present being put for the future, because of the certainty of it, as usual in prophetic writings; or be utterly destroyed by Shalmaneser, and be no more a kingdom: <p>their root is dried up; like the root of a tree that has no sap and moisture in it, and can communicate none to the body and branches of the tree, which in course must die. This may be understood of their king, princes, nobles, and chief men, the support and strength of the nations; and of parents and heads of families, cut off by one judgment or another: <p>they shall bear no fruit; as a tree thus smitten, and its root dried up, cannot; so neither, this being their case, there would be none to beget, nor any to bear children, and bring them forth; called the fruit of the womb, in allusion to the fruit of trees: <p>yea, though they bring forth; though some of them should be spared, women with their husbands, and should procreate children: <p>yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb; their children they should bring forth, on whom their affections were strongly set; and the rather, as they were but few, and from whom they had raised expectations of building up their families; even these the Lord would stay, or suffer to be slain, either by the sword of the enemy, or by famine, or by pestilence, or by some disease or another; so that there should be no hope of a future posterity, at least of no great number of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Ephraim is smitten</span> …] Ephraim’s population is compared to the branches of a tree, and the national vitality to the root.

This is the meaning of the verse, which has been very differently rendered. The majority of modern interpreters separate the two parts of the verse from each other, for they refer the first hemistich to the preceding, and in the second they find a new thought expressed. Hvernick and v. Lengerke supply a demonstrative &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, thus: - thus shall he do to the armed fortresses together with the strange gods, i.e., fill the fortified temples with treasures, and promote their worship. But the supplement &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is here just as arbitrary as is the interpreting of the armed fortresses of temples. Hitzig misses the object to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, and seeks it by changing &#1506;&#1501; into &#1506;&#1501;: he prepares for the armed fortresses a people of a strange god; but apart from the fact that the change of the text is arbitrary, the use of the expression "people of a strange god" for colonists is most singular. Ewald translates the expression thus: "he proceeds with the strong fortresses as with the strange god," and explains: "he loves the fortresses only just as a god;" but he has given no proof that &#1500; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; means to love. The missing object to &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; follows in the second hemistich, just as in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-4.htm">Deuteronomy 31:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-11.htm">Isaiah 10:11</a>. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; means simply to do anything to one (Kran., Klief.). &#1504;&#1499;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1501;, with the help of the strange god (&#1506;&#1501; of assistance, as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a>), not: in the mind of the strange god (Kliefoth). &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1489;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;, fortified, i.e., strong fortresses, are not the fortified walls and houses, but the inhabitants of the fortified cities. With these he does according to his will with the help of his god, i.e., of war, namely in this, that he rewards with honour and power only those who acknowledge him. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, who acknowledges, sc. him, the king who made war his god. Hitzig has incorrectly interpreted: whom he acknowledges. The Keri &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; for the Kethiv &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; is an unnecessary emendation here, as in <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a> with &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;. The verb &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; is chosen to reflect upon the word &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;. It means to recognise, properly to acknowledge him as what he is or wishes to be; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>. Such an one he shall increase with honour, confer upon him sovereignty over many, and divide the land. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1497;&#1512; is not for payment, for recompense, as the contrast to &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (gratuitously) (Kran.). That is not a suitable rendering here. The word rather means pro praemio, as a reward (Maur., Klief.), as a reward for the recognition accorded to him. The Vulgate renders it rightly according to the sense, gratuito. In this most modern interpreters find a reference to the circumstance that Antiochus occupied the Jewish fortresses with heathen garrisons, and rewarded his adherents with places of honour and with possessions of land (2 Macc. 4:10, 24; 5:15). But this is what all conquerors do, and it was not peculiar to Antiochus, so that it could be mentioned as characteristic of him. The words contain the altogether common thought that the king will bestow honour, power, and possessions on those who acknowledge him and conduct themselves according to his will, and they accord with the character of Antichrist in a yet higher degree than with that of Antiochus.</body></html>
