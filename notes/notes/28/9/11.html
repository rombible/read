God departs from a people, or from a person, when he withdraws his goodness and mercy from them; and when the Lord is departed, what can the creature do? Even though, for the present, good things seem to remain, yet the blessing is gone if God is gone. Even the children should perish with the parents. The Divine wrath dries up the root, and withers the fruit of all comforts; and the scattered Jews daily warn us to beware, lest we neglect or abuse the gospel. Yet every smiting is not a drying up of the root. It may be that God intends only to smite so that the sap may be turned to the root, that there may be more of root graces, more humility, patience, faith, and self-denial. It is very just that God should bring judgments on those who slight his offered mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away, like a bird - Ephraim had parted with God, his true Glory. In turn, God would quickly take from him all created glory, all which he counted glory, or in which he gloried. When man parts with the substance, his true honor, God takes away the shadow, lest he should content himself therewith, and not see his shame, and, boasting himself to be something, abide in his nothingness and poverty and shame to which he had reduced himself. "Fruitfulness," and consequent strength, had been God's special promise to Ephraim. His name, Ephraim, contained in itself the promise of his future fruitfulness. <a href="/genesis/41-52.htm">Genesis 41:52</a>. With this Jacob had blessed him. He was to be greater than Manasseh, his older brother, "and his seed shall become a multitude of nations" <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>. Moses had assigned to him "tens of thousands" <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>, while to Manasseh he had promised "thousands" only. On this blessing Ephraim had presumed, and had made it to feed his pride; so now God, in his justice and mercy, would withdraw it from him. It should "make" itself "wings, and fly away" <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>, with the swiftness of a bird, and "like a bird," not to return again to the place, from where it has been scared.<p>From the birth - Their children were to perish at every stage in which they received life. This sentence pursued them back to the very beginning of life. First, when their parents should have joy in "their birth," they were to come into the world only to go out of it; then, their mothers womb was to be itself their grave; then, stricken with barrenness, the womb itself was to refuse to conceive them.<p>: "The glory of Ephraim passes away, from the birth, the womb, the conception, when the mind which before was, for glory, half-deified, receives, through the just judgment of God, ill report for good report, misery for glory, hatred for favor, contempt for reverence, loss for gain, famine for abundance. Act is the "birth;" intention the "womb;" thought the "conception." "The glory of Ephraim then flies away from the birth, the womb, the conception," when, in those who before did outwardly live nobly, and gloried in themselves for the outward propriety of their life, the acts are disgraced, the intention corrupted, the thoughts defiled." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. their glory shall fly away&#8212;fit retribution to those who "separated themselves unto that shame" (Ho 9:10).

After the figure comes the fact, and it is expressed in anti-climactic form - no child-bearing, no pregnancy, no conception. The course of barrenness takes the place of the blessing of fruitfulness. Though they bring up their children, yet will I believe them, that there shall not be a man left. Even if their sons should grow up to manhood and attain maturity, yet they would be cut off by the sword and swept away by death, so that their progeny would perish. This accords with the threatened punishment of unfaithfulness recorded in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>, "The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of grey hairs."

The meaning is a little different: "when I look away from them." Rashi mentions the fact that this word belongs to those words written with <span class="accented">sin</span> but read with <span class="accented">samech</span>. His comment on the verse is correct: "For what benefit have they when they bring up their children? Because, if they do bring them up, then I bereave them so that they do not become men;" similarly Kimchi: "If there be some among them who escape these mishaps and reach the birth, and they (the parents) bring them up yet shall they die in youth, and never reach the season when they shall be called men." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The misreading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> by the LXX. led to the strange misrendering, "Wherefore also there is a woe to them (though) my flesh is of them (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>,) of which Cyril connects the first member with the preceding words, and, detaching the remainder, interpreted, "Let my flesh be far for exemption from the punishment threatened. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer</span>. The first member of this verse has called forth great diversity of translation and interpretation. It were tedious, and not conducive to the right understanding of the verse, to enumerate the various expositions given of it. A <span class="accented">very</span> few of the most important may be briefly noticed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, rendered, "Ephraim, even as I saw, gave her children for a <span class="accented">prey</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ewald, conjecturing <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, renders," Ephraim is, as I judge, according to the <span class="accented">form</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> planting in a meadow." Rejecting both these, we come <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to that of Gesenius: "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span>, like Tyro (as if it were Tyro), is planted in a beautiful meadow;" De Wette's is," Ephraim, when (or if) I look as far as Tyro, is planted on a pleasant meadow;" Keil has, "Ephraim, as I selected it for a Tyro planted in the valley; so shall Ephraim lead out its <span class="accented">sons</span> to the <span class="accented">murderer</span>." All these renderings are faulty in one respect or other; some of them miss the sense altogether, and others of them obscure it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The rendering that appears to us simplest, most in harmony with the Hebrew, and most suitable to the context, is that of Wunshe, but with a modification that of a secure dwelling-place instead of meadow: "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span>, as I look towards Tyro, is planted on a meadow [rather, '<span class="accented">sure</span> resting-place'], and Ephraim must lead out its sons to the murderer." The meaning, then, is that Ephraim is a lovely land in whatever direction one looks towards it, like the famous Tyro; it was beautiful and blooming, populous as well as pleasant; or rather, strong in its natural fortifications, like the famous capital of Phoenicia; yet the wrath of Heaven hung over it - it would become waste and emptied of its male population, Ephraim being obliged to send forth the bravest of her sons to repel the hostile invader, and to perish in the tumult of the battle. By combining a part of Rashi's exposition with part of Kimchi's, we reach the correct <span class="accented">sense</span>. Rashi has, "<span class="accented">Ephraim</span> as I look towards Tyro, which in its prosperity is crowned above all cities, so I look upon Ephraim planted on a meadow;" so far the explanation is correct, not so what follow: "And Ephraim - how does he reward me? He is busied in bringing forth his <span class="accented">sons to</span> the murderer in order to sacrifice them to idols;" in place of this latter part we substitute the following of Kimchi: "<span class="accented">The</span> enemies shall come upon them, and they shall march out from their cities to meet them in battle, and the enemies shall slay them." The infinitive with <span class="accented">le</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, implies the necessity imposed on Ephraim to do so. Ephraim is to had out, or <span class="accented">must</span> lead out, his <span class="accented">sons to</span> the murderer. Rosenm&uuml;ller, in his commentary, has the following remark on this idiom at the fifteenth verse of the forty-ninth psalm: "Tempus infinitivum positum <span class="accented">esse fututri</span> sire aoristi, vice, pro eo quod plenum esset <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span>   =   paratus <span class="accented">est</span>," etc. He adds that the Syriac prefixes <span class="accented">arid</span>, equivalent to paratus est to the infinitive with <span class="accented">lomad</span>, and so makes a paraphrase of the future; while the Hebrews omit <span class="accented">arid</span>. Driver ('Hebrew Tenses,' p. 300) says of this usage of the so-called "periphrastic future," "Hero the infinitive with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, expressing as usual a direction, tendency, or aim, forms the sole predicate: the subject, as a rule, stands first, so as to engage the mind, the purpose which is postulated for it follows; and thus the idea arises of an inevitable sequence or obligation , though net one of a formal or pronounced character, which is expressed in Hebrew by other means (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by the addition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, or of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, equivalent to 'incumbent upon me'); <a href="/hosea/9-13.htm">Hosea 9:13</a>, 'And Ephraim <span class="accented">is for bringing forth</span> his sons to the slayer;' or, as this is the entire scope and object in regard to which Ephraim is here considered  <span class="accented">- is to</span> or <span class="accented">must</span> bring forth." Give them, O Lord: what writ thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. The prophet seems at a loss to know what he should ask for his countrymen. Though it was not total excision, but rather diminution of numbers, that was threatened in accordance with the statement, "<span class="accented">If</span> thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this Law... ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude;" yet at every stage their offspring was to be cut off, or, if spared to arrive at manhood, it was only to fall by the hand of the murderer. No wonder, then, the prophet is perplexed in regard to the petition that would be most expedient for them.

We may not therefore, with Hitzig and others, limit this expression to the circumstance that with the victories of Judas Maccabaeus (1 Macc. 3:11ff., 23ff., 4:14, etc.) they were far from gaining all, for they also met with a defeat (1 Macc. 5:60f.). For with the overthrow of Antiochus and the liberation of the Jews from the Syrian yoke, full help was not yet rendered to the people of God. The "little help" consists in this, that by the rising up and the wars of those that had understanding among the people the theocracy was preserved, the destruction of the service of Jehovah and of the church of God, which was aimed at by the hostile king, was prevented, and, as the following clauses express, the purifying of the people of God is brought about. This purifying is the design and the fruit of the oppression which God brings upon His people by means of the hostile king. The attaining of this end is a "little help" in comparison with the complete victory over the arch-enemy of the time of the end.

"The successes of Judas, and the severity with which he and Mattathias treated the apostates (1 Macc. 2:44; 3:5, 8), had the result of causing many to join them only through hypocrisy (1 Macc. 7:6; 2 Macc. 14:6), who again forsook them as soon as opportunity offered; 1 Macc. 6:21ff., 9:23" (Hitzig, Kliefoth).</body></html>
