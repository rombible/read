It is common for those who are niggardly in religion, to be prodigal upon their lusts. Those are reckoned as idolaters, who love a reward in the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and in eternal life. They are full of the joy of harvest, and have no disposition to mourn for sin. When we make the world, and the things of it, our idol and our portion, it is just with God to show us our folly, and correct us. None may expect to dwell in the Lord's land, who will not be subject to the Lord's laws, or be influenced by his love. When we enjoy the means of grace, we ought to consider what we shall do, if they should be taken from us. While the pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of change, the pleasant places purchased with silver, or in which men deposit silver, are liable to be laid in ruins. No famine is so dreadful as that of the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The floor and winepress shall not feed them - God turneth away wholly from the adulterous people, and telleth others, how justly they shall be dealt with first for this. "Because she loved My reward, and despised Myself, the reward itself shall be taken away from her." When the blessings of God have been abused to sin, He, in mercy and judgment, takes them away. He cut them off, in order to show that He alone, who now withheld them, had before given them. When they thought themselves most secure, when the grain was stored on the floor, and the grapes were in the press, then God would deprive them of them.<p>And the new wine shall fail in her, or shall fail her - Literally, "shall lie to her." It may be, he would say, that as Israel had lied to his God, and had "spoken lies against Him" <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>, so, in requital, the fruits of the earth should disappoint her, and holding out hopes which never came to pass, should, as it were, lie to her, and in the bitterness of her disappointment, represent to her her own failure to her God.

Though their expectations from their worship of idols were large, they should find themselves mistaken; for there would not be a sufficiency of corn on the floor, nor of wine in the press, to supply them with what was necessary for their sustenance; either through a blight upon their fields and vineyards, or through the invasion of an enemy, treading them down, and spoiling and foraging them: or else supposing a sufficient quantity of corn and wine got in; yet those blessings should be either turned into curses, or carried off by the enemy, that they should do then, no good; or if they enjoyed them, yet they should receive no nourishment from them; but should become lean, and look like starved and famishing creatures in the midst of plenty; by all which it would appear that their idols could neither give them a sufficiency of provisions, nor make those nourishing to them they had: <p>and the new wine shall fail in her; in the congregation or land of Israel: or, "shall lie to her" (s); shall not answer their expectations, but disappoint and deceive them; whereas they expected great plenty from the promising prospect of the vines, these by one means or another should be destroyed, so that they would yield but little, and balk them; see <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a>. <p>(s)  "mentietur in ea", Pagninus, Montanus, Zanchius; "mentietur isti", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Liveleus, Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{c}</span> The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</span><p>(c) These outward things that you seek will be taken from you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the winepress</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the vat</span> (within the press) into which the grape-juice or the oil flowed; comp. <a href="/joel/2-24.htm" title="And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.">Joel 2:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall fail in her</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">shall fall her</span> (lit. ‘shall lie unto her’, as <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm" title="Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:">Habakkuk 3:17</a>).

Idolatrous Israel is personified as a harlot. Wine-drinking was, in fact, so closely connected with the customs of idolatry (comp. <a href="/judges/9-27.htm" title="And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and stepped the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.">Jdg 9:27</a>; <a href="/amos/2-8.htm" title="And they lay themselves down on clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.">Amos 2:8</a>), that the Nazirites bound themselves by a vow of ‘total abstinence’ (<a href="/numbers/6-3.htm" title="He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.">Numbers 6:3</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</span> Thus Israel was not to enjoy the blessings of the harvest; the corn and oil and new wine, or corn and wine, would not prove as abundant as they expected or plenty would be succeeded by scarcity; or, rather, the people would be prevented enjoying the abundant produce of their land in consequence of being carried away captive to Assyria, as seems implied in the following verse. The floor and press - whether wine-prom, or rather oil-press, as the mention of new wine follows - are put for their contents by a common figure of speech. The expression, "fail in her," is literally, "lie to her," and has many parallels; as, "The labor of the olive shall fail [margin, 'lie']," and Horace's "fundus mendax," equivalent to "a farm that belies his hopes." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These verses describe the victorious war of the king who had come to power against the king of the south, the war of Antiochus Epiphanes against king Ptolemy Philometor, which is described in 1 Macc. 1:16-19, with manifest reference to this prophecy. &#1493;&#1497;&#1506;&#1512; (he shall stir up) is potentialis in the sense of divine decree: "he shall stir up his power and his heart." &#1499;&#1468;&#1495; is not warlike power, which is mentioned in &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; (<a href="/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a>), but the power which consists in the bringing of a great army under his command; &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;, the mental energy for the carrying out of his plans.
