The people were become as corrupt as those of Gibeah, Jud 19; and their crimes should be visited in like manner. At first God had found Israel pleasing to Him, as grapes to the traveller in the wilderness. He saw them with pleasure as the first ripe figs. This shows the delight God took in them; yet they followed after idolatry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The watchman of Ephraim was with my God - These words may well contrast the office of the true prophet with the false. For Israel had had many true prophets, and such was Hosea himself now. The true prophet was at all times with "God." He was "with God," as holpen by God, "watching" or looking out and on into the future by the help of God. He was "with God," as walking with God in a constant sense of His presence, and in continual communion with Him. He was "with God," as associated by God with Himself, in teaching, warning, correcting, exhorting His people, as the Apostle says, "we then as workers together with Him" <a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>.<p>It might also be rendered in nearly the same sense, "Ephraim was a watchman with my God," and this is more according to the Hebrew words. As though the whole people of Israel had an office from God , "and God addressed it as a whole, 'I made thee, as it were, a watchman and prophet of God to the neighboring nations, that through My providence concerning thee, and thy living according to the law, they too might receive the knowledge of Me. But thou hast acted altogether contrary to this, for thou hast become a snare to them. '"<p>Yet perhaps, if so construed, it would rather mean, "Ephraim is a watchman, beside my God," as it is said, "There is none upon earth, that I desire with Thee" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/73-25.htm">Psalm 73:25</a>, i. e., beside Thee. In God the Psalmist had all, and desired to have nothing "with," i. e., beside God. Ephraim was not content with God's revelations, but would himself be "a seer, an espier" of future events, the prophet says with indignation, "together with my God." God, in fact, sufficed. Ephraim not. Ahab hated God's prophet, "because he did not speak good concerning him but evil" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/22-18.htm">1 Kings 22:18</a>. And so the kings of Israel had court-prophets of their own, an establishment, as it would seem, of four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and four hundred prophets of Ashtaroth <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>, which was filled up again by new impostors <a href="/2_kings/3-13.htm">2 Kings 3:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19</a>, when after the miracle of Mount Carmel, Elijah, according to the law <a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>, put to death the prophets of Baal. These false prophets, as well as those of Judah in her evil days, flattered the kings who supported them, misled them, encouraged them in disbelieving the threatenings of God, and so led to their destruction. By these means, the bad priests maintained their hold over the people. They were the antichrists of the Old Testament, disputing the authority of God, in whose name they prophesied. Ephraim encouraged their sins, as God says of Judah by Jeremiah, "My people love to have it so" <a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>. It willed to be deceived, and was so.<p>"On searching diligently ancient histories," says Jerome, "I could not find that any divided the Church, or seduced people from the house of the Lord, except those who have been set by God as priests and prophets, i. e. watchmen. These then are turned into a snare, setting a stumbling-block everywhere, so that whosoever entereth on their ways, falls, and cannot stand in Christ, and is led away by various errors and crooked paths to a precipice." : "No one," says another great father, "doth wider injury than one who acteth perversely, while he hath a name or an order of holiness." "God endureth no greater prejudice from any than from priests, when He seeth those whom He has set for the correction of others, give from themselves examples of perverseness, when "we" sin, who ought to restrain sin. What shall become of the flock, when the pastors become wolves?"<p>The false prophet is the snare of a fowler in - (literally, "upon") all his ways i. e., whatever Ephraim would do, wherever the people, as a whole or any of them, would go, there the false prophet beset them, endeavoring to make each and everything a means of holding them back from their God. This they did, "being hatred in the house of his God." As one says, "I am (all) prayer" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4</a>, because he was so given up to prayer that he seemed turned into prayer; his whole soul was concentrated in prayer; so of these it is said, "they" were "hatred." They hated so intensely, that their whole soul was turned into hatred; they were as we say, hatred personified; hatred was embodied in them, and they ensouled with hate. They were also the source of hatred against God and man. And this each false prophet was "in the house of his God!" for God was still his God, although not owned by him as God. God is the sinners God to avenge, if he will not allow Him to be his God, to convert and pardon. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Formerly the watchmen of Ephraim, or the prophets of Israel, were with the true God, whom the prophet calls his God; as Elijah and Elisha, who had communion and intimacy with him; had revelations and instructions from him; and were under the direction and inspiration of his Spirit, and prophesied in his name things according to his will, and for the good of his people: or "the watchman of Ephraim should be with my God"; on his side, and promote his worship and service, his honour and interest; and give the people warning from him, having heard the word at his mouth: but now they were not with him, nor for him, nor did as they should: or one that bore this character of a watchman in the ten tribes, pretended to be such a one, and would be thought to be with God, and to have his mind and will, and to be sincere for his glory: <p>but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways; the false prophet, the same with the watchman, instead of guiding and directing Ephraim in the right way in which he should go, lays snares for him in all the ways he takes, to lead him wrong, and draw him into sin, particularly into idolatry, both by his doctrine and example: <p>and hatred in the house of his God; and so became detestable and execrable it the house of his own god, the calf at Bethel, in the temple there: prophesying such things as in the event prove false, and drawing into such practices as brought on ruin and desolation.

There is a various reading ‘his God’ (so also Rashi), but ‘my God’ can be well defended; for the watchman spoken of is Hosea himself. We have ‘my God’ again in <span class="ital"><a href="/hosea/9-17.htm" title="My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.">Hosea 9:17</a></span>. The figure implied is developed more fully in <a href="/jeremiah/6-17.htm" title="Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not listen.">Jeremiah 6:17</a>, ‘Also I set watchmen over you, (saying,) Hearken to the sound of the trumpet.’ ‘With my God’ = ‘in communion with’ or ‘helped by.’ The connexion will, however, be improved if we suppose that, owing to the fact that ‘Ephraim’ ends with a <span class="ital">Mem</span>, the same letter has dropped out at the beginning of the next word. In this case, render (connecting this and the next clause), <span class="bld">Ephraim’s watchman, appointed by my God</span> [comp. in the Hebrew, <a href="/isaiah/8-11.htm" title="For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,">Isaiah 8:11</a>], <span class="bld">even the prophet—a fowler’s snare is</span>, &c. An entirely wrong view of the construction is suggested by the vowel-points (which of course form no part of the text proper), viz. ‘Ephraim looketh out (for help) beside my God’; but ‘beside’ cannot mean ‘apart from’; or ‘Ephraim is a lier in wait (in his fight) against my God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but the prophet is</span>, &c.] See last note. The prophet meant is a true not a false prophet (as Keil takes it), for though the false prophets might be likened to a fowler’s snare, their conduct could not be spoken of as ‘envious’ or ‘persecuting’ towards Ephraim. It is rather the Ephraimites who are always laying snares (comp. <a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm" title="That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.">Isaiah 29:21</a>) for their troublesome ‘watchman.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hatred</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">enmity</span> (or, hostility; or, persecution).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the house of his God</span>] This must to some extent be equivalent to the parallel words ‘in all his ways.’ In <span class="ital"><a href="/hosea/9-15.htm" title="All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more: all their princes are rebels.">Hosea 9:15</a></span> ‘mine house’ means the land of Canaan, and so probably here. Jehovah is not their God, for they (Israel) ‘know’ Him not; and they cannot abide those who, like Hosea (<span class="ital"><a href="/hosea/9-8.htm" title="The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.">Hosea 9:8</a></span>) and the psalmist (<a href="/psalms/73-23.htm" title="Nevertheless I am continually with you: you have held me by my right hand.">Psalm 73:23</a>), are ‘continually with Him.’<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Here is stated what he accomplished by the help of the apostate Jews. &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, arms, figuratively for help (<a href="/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a>), are warlike forces, as <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-15.htm">Daniel 11:15</a>, <a href="/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a>. That the plur. has here the masculine form, while in those verses it has the fem. form, furnishes no reason for a difference of meaning, since &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; in its proper sense of arm occurs promiscue with both endings in the plur.; cf. for &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>. &#1502;&#1503; in &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is not partitive, a part of him, i.e., the host as a part of the king (Hitzig), but out from him, or by his command. &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, to stand up, not to stand still, as Hitzig, on the ground of the supposition that Antiochus on his return from Egypt placed a standing army-corps in Jerusalem, would interpret it, contrary to the usage of the word, since &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; does not signify to stand still in the sense of to remain behind, though it means to endure, to keep the ground (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-6.htm">Daniel 11:6</a>, <a href="/daniel/11-15.htm">Daniel 11:15</a>). It is disputed whether these &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; denote military forces, troops of the hostile king (Hvernick, v. Leng., Maur., Hitz., Klief.), or his accomplices of the apostate party of the Jews, and thus essentially identical with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;, <a href="/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> (Calvin, Hengstb. Christol. iii. 1, p. 110, Kran., and others). In favour of the latter view, Kranichfeld argues that the &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497; (those that forsake the covenant), according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, come under consideration as a support to the king, and the &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; of this verse before us evidently refers to the king's own army, and therefore would be superfluous. But these two reasons prove nothing. The &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is not superfluous, even though it were used of the king's own army. Since in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, <a href="/daniel/11-32.htm">Daniel 11:32</a> the king of the north is the subject of the clause, it was necessary in &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; to define in what relation they stood to the king. But the other remark, that the &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497; come into view as a support to the king, does not prove that these are the same who desecrate the sanctuary and set up the abomination of desolation. On the contrary, if &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; denotes the causal exit, the &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be the apostate Jews, but only warlike forces which the king leads forth. If we refer &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; to the apostate Jews, then we must, with Hengstenberg and Gesenius, take &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in the sense of eo jubente. Moreover, the &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; manifestly stand in contrast to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497; of <a href="/daniel/11-32.htm">Daniel 11:32</a>. By his troops (military forces) the king lays waste the sanctuary, and he makes by means of smooth words those who sin against the covenant heathen. Kranichfeld himself recognises this contrast, and therefore will understand as the subject to &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; not merely "those that forsake the covenant" (<a href="/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>), but these along with and including the warlike power of the hostile king. An expedient which the difficulty suggested. &#1492;&#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is the temple, and &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (the strength) is in apposition. This apposition, however, does not say that the temple was fortified (v. Leng., Hitzig, Ewald), but it points out the temple as the spiritual fortress of Israel. The temple is the "Feste Burg" (firm tower) of the holy covenant (<a href="/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>), as the dwelling-place of Jehovah, which is a firm fortress to His people; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">Psalm 31:4-5</a>, (3, 4); <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a> (2). &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is essentially identical with &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1498;, <a href="/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>. The two following clauses state what the desecration consists in: in the taking away, the removal of the stated worship of Jehovah, and in the placing, setting up of the abomination of desolation, i.e., of the idol-altar on Jehovah's altar of burnt-offering; see under <a href="/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501; is not the genitive, but an adjective to &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (without the article after the definite noun, as e.g., <a href="/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>): the desolating abomination, i.e., the abomination which effects the desolation. With reference to the fulfilment, cf. 1 Macc. 1:37, 45, 54. </body></html>
