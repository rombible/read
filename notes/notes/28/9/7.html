The latter is more probable. (Comp. the following verse.) Other commentators, including Maurer and Hitzig (preceded by Jerome and many Jewish as well as Christian expositors) take the words for prophet in this verse as signifying “false prophet,” and would connect the clauses thus:—“Israel shall recognise that the prophet (who prophesied good to them) is a fool, the inspired one a madman, because of,” &c. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew for “inspired one” (<span class= "ital">îsh harûach</span>) can bear this unfavourable sense, with the definite article affixed (comp. <a href="/1_kings/22-21.htm" title="And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.">1Kings 22:21</a>, Heb.); so Nowack.

The people were become as corrupt as those of Gibeah, Jud 19; and their crimes should be visited in like manner. At first God had found Israel pleasing to Him, as grapes to the traveller in the wilderness. He saw them with pleasure as the first ripe figs. This shows the delight God took in them; yet they followed after idolatry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The days of visitation are come - The false prophets had continually hood-winked the people, promising them that those days would never come. "They had put far away the evil day" <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>. Now it was not at hand only. In God's purpose, those "days" were "come," irresistible, inevitable, inextricable; days in which God would visit, what in His long-suffering, He seemed to overlook, and would "recompense each according to his works."<p>Israel shall know it - Israel would not know by believing it; now it should "know," by feeling it.<p>The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad - The true prophet gives to the false the title which they claimed for themselves, "the prophet" and "the man of the spirit." Only the event showed what spirit was in them, not the spirit of God but a lying spirit. The people of the world called the true prophets, "mad," literally, maddened, "driven mad," , as Festus thought of Paul; "Thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad" <a href="/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>. Jehu's captains called by the same name the young prophet whom Elisha sent to anoint him. "Wherefore came this mad fellow unto thee?" <a href="/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>. Shemaiah, the false prophet, who deposed God's priest, set false priests to "be officers in the house of the Lord," to have an oversight as to "every man who is mad and maketh himself a prophet," calling Jeremiah both a false prophet and a "madman" (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25-26</a>. The word is the same).<p>The event was the test. Of our Lord Himself, the Jews blaspbemed, "He hath a devil and is mad" <a href="/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a>. And long afterward, "madness," "phrensy" were among the names which the pagan gave to the faith in Christ . As Paul says, that "Christ crucified" was "to the Greeks" and to "them that perish, foolishness," and that the "things of the Spirit of God, are foolishness to the natural man, neither can he know" them, "because they are spiritually discerned" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>. The man of the world and the Christian judge of the same things by clean contrary rules, use them for quite contrary ends. The slave of pleasure counts him mad, who foregoes it; the wealthy trader counts him mad, who gives away profusely. In these days, profusion for the love of Christ has been counted a ground for depriving a man of the care of his property. One or the other is mad. And worldlings must count the Christian mad; else they must own themselves to be so most fearfully. In the Day of Judgment, Wisdom says, "They, repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit, shall say within themselves, This was he whom we had sometimes in derision and a proverb of reproach. We fools counted his life madness, and his end to be without honor. How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!" (Wisd. 5:3-6).<p>For the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred - The words stand at the close of the verse, as the reason of all which had gone before. Their "manifold iniquity" and their "great hatred" of God were the ground why the "days of visitation" and "recompense" should "come." They were the ground also, why God allowed such prophets to delude them. The words, "the great hatred," stand quite undefined, so that they may signify alike the hatred of Ephraim against God and good people and His true prophets, or God's hatred of them. Yet it, most likely, means, "their" great hatred, since of them the prophet uses it again in the next verse. The sinner first neglects God; then, as the will of God is brought before him, he willfully disobeys Him; then, when, he finds God's will irreconcilably at variance with his own, or when God chastens him, he hates Him, and (the prophet speaks out plainly) "hates" Him "greatly." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. visitation&#8212;vengeance: punishment (Isa 10:3).<p>Israel shall know it&#8212;to her cost experimentally (Isa 9:9).<p>the prophet is a fool&#8212;The false prophet who foretold prosperity to the nation shall be convicted of folly by the event.<p>the spiritual man&#8212;the man pretending to inspiration (La 2:14; Eze 13:3; Mic 3:11; Zep 3:4).<p>for the multitude of thine iniquity, &c.&#8212;Connect these words with, "the days of visitation &#8230; are come"; "the prophet &#8230; is mad," being parenthetical.<p>the great hatred&#8212;or, "the great provocation" [Henderson]; or, "(thy) great apostasy" [Maurer].

In which the Lord would punish the people of Israel for their sins, and reward them in a righteous manner, according as their evil works deserved; which time, being fixed and appointed by him, are called "days"; and these, because near at hand, are said to be "come"; and this is repeated for the certainty of it: <p>Israel shall know it; by sad experience, that these days are come; and shall acknowledge the truth of the divine predictions, and the righteousness of God in his judgments. Schultens (z), from the use of the phrase in the Arabic language, interprets it of Israel's suffering punishment; with which agrees the Septuagint version, "Israel shall be afflicted", or it shall go ill with him; and to the same purpose the Arabic version: <p>the prophet is a fool; so Israel said, before those days came, of a true prophet of the Lord, that he was a fool for prophesying of evil things, but now they shall find it otherwise. So the Targum, <p>"they of the house of Israel shall know that they who had prophesied to them were true prophets;'' <p>but rather this is to be understood of false prophets, who, when the day of God's visitation shall come on Israel in a way of wrath and vengeance, will appear both to themselves and others to be fools, for prophesying good things to them, when evil was at hand: <p>the spiritual man is mad; he that was truly so, and prophesied under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, was accounted a madman for speaking against the idolatry of the times, and foretelling the judgments of God that would come upon the nation for it; but now it would be manifest, that not he, but such who pretended to be spiritual men, and to be directed and dictated by the Spirit of God, when they promised the people peace, though they walked after the imagination of their hearts, were the real madmen; who pursued the frenzies and fancies of their own minds, to the deception of themselves and the people, and called these the revelations of God, and pretended they came from the Spirit of God: <p>for the multitude of thine iniquities, and the great hatred; that is, either those evil days came upon them for their manifold sins and transgressions, which were hateful to God, and the cause of his hatred of them; or they were suffered to give heed to those foolish and mad prophets, because of their many sins, especially idolatry; and because of their great hatred of God, and of his true prophets, and of his laws and ordinances, of his word, will, and worship, and of one another, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to a judicial blindness and hardness of heart, to believe a lie, and whatsoever those false prophets declared unto them, because they did not like to retain him in their knowledge, to walk according to his law, and to believe his prophets.

Another view of these words (in connexion with the following clause) is, ‘Israel shall perceive (but too late) how it has been deceived by its prophets.’ But a false prophet would never be called a ‘man of the spirit’, but rather ‘one that followeth his own spirit’ (<a href="/ezekiel/13-3.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!">Ezekiel 13:3</a>); and neither ‘a fool’ nor ‘mad’ suggests the idea of falsehood or hypocrisy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad</span>] These words evidently convey a reproach, for though ‘mad’ might be taken in a good sense (= frenzied with sorrow, as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-34.htm" title="So that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.">Deuteronomy 28:34</a>), ‘a fool’ could hardly be. But if so, introductory words must have dropped out of the text, such as ‘who say in their pride.’ ‘The spiritual man’ is, literally, ‘the man of the Spirit’, i.e. ‘the inspired man’, Sept. <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος ὁ πνευματοφόρος</span>. ‘Mad’, or ‘a madman’, ‘a fanatic’, is a term applied disparagingly to a prophet’s disciple in <a href="/2_kings/9-11.htm" title="Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you? And he said to them, You know the man, and his communication.">2 Kings 9:11</a>, and to Jeremiah by an opponent in <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm" title="The LORD has made you priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.">Jeremiah 29:26</a>.

These words are to be connected with the preceding. Israel spoke thus because its iniquity was great, and great also the enmity which certain classes (probably) felt towards the higher prophets. The priests and the lower class of prophets would be at one in their hostility to Hosea. More is said of this feud in the next verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - These verses describe the season and source of punishment. <span class="cmt_word">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come.</span> Commentators have appropriately compared the Vergilian "Venit summa dies, et irreluctabile tempus," equivalent to" The final day and inevitable hour is come." <span class="cmt_word">Israel shall know</span> (it): <span class="cmt_word">the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad</span>. Here the prophet and the man of the spirit (margin) are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the false prophets which pretended to inspiration, and flattered the people with false hopes and vain promises of safety and prosperity; and thus helped to confirm them in their sinful courses. The object of Israel's knowledge, though not introduced by <span class="accented">ki</span>, is the folly of such false prophets, and the madness of such pretenders to prophetic inspiration. That <span class="accented">ish ruach</span> may be used of a false prophet as well as of a true one is proved from <span class="accented">ish holekh ruach</span>, a man walking in the spirit, applied by <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> to one of these pretenders: "If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people." Israel is doomed to know by bitter experience the folly and madness of those prophets who deceived and duped the people by lies soon detected, and their own folly and madness in giving ear to the delusive prospects they held forth. This explanation agrees with Kimchi's comment: "Then shall they confess, and say to the prophets of lies, who had led them astray, and had said to them, Peace (in time of greatest peril) - then shall they say unto them, A fool the prophet, a madman the man of spirit." The predicate precedes the subject for emphasis, and the article prefixed to the subject exhausts the class of those false prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Aben Ezra, Ewald, and many others understand the prophet and spiritual man to mean true prophets, which the people called fools and madmen, and treated is such, contemning and persecuting them. Thus Aben Ezra: "The days of recompense are come to you from God, who will recompense you who said to the prophet of God, He is a fool, and to the man in whom the spirit of God was, He is mad." The word me<span class="accented">shuggah</span> is properly the participle Paul used as a substantive, and kindred in meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Greek, from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be frenzied.

The visitation threatened, which was retributive - a recompense - was for the greatness of their iniquity. The last clause is thus dependent on and closely connected with the first, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ruling the construction first as a preposition, then as a conjunction: "And because the enmity is great." Ewald says, "If the first member states a reason (e.g. by using the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, on account of, because of, and the following infinitive), the meaning requires that, whenever a finite verb follows, the conjunction 'because' shall be employed in forming the continuation." The hatred was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that of Israel against their fellow-men, and their God or his prophetic messengers; though others <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> understand it of the hatred of God against transgressors who had provoked his just indignation. The first exposition (a) suits the context, and is supported by the following verse. <span class="cmt_word">The watchman of Ephraim was with my God.</span> This rendering is manifestly inaccurate, as the first noun is in the absolute, not in the construct state; the right rendering, therefore, is either, "A watchman is Ephraim with my God;" or, "The watchman, O Ephraim, is with my God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If we adopt Aben Ezra's explanation of the prophet and spiritual man as true prophets whom the people jeeringly and scornfully called fools, fanatics, and madmen, the meaning of this clause of the next verse presents little difficulty. The prophet makes common cause with these divided prophets: his God was their God, and, however men treated them, they were under Divine protection. The sense of the <span class="accented">ira</span>, with, in this case is well given by Pusey as follows: "The true prophet was at all times <span class="accented">frith</span> God. He was <span class="accented">with</span> God, as holden by God, <span class="accented">watching</span> or looking out and on into the future by the help of God. He was <span class="accented">with</span> God, as walking with God in a constant sense of his presence, and in continual communion with him. He was with God, as associated by God with himself in teaching, warning, correcting, exhorting his people, as the apostle says, We then are workers together with him. In the next clause the false prophet is described by way of contrast as a snare. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> is properly a participle, and Ephraim is thus exhibited by the prophet as on the outlook, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> not for counsel and help beside or apart from God, as Gesenius understands it; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> as on the outlook for revelations and prophecies along with my God; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Ephraim, not satisfied with the genuine prophets, had prophets of his own, which spake to the people according to their wish. This exposition is in the main supported by Rashi and Kimchi: the former says, "They appoint for themselves prophets of their own;" and Kimchi more fully thus, "Ephraim has appointed for himself a watchman (or seer) at the side of his God; and he is the false prophet who speaks his prophecy in the name of his God." (But) <span class="cmt_word">the prophet is a snare of a fowler in</span> (over) <span class="cmt_word">all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.</span> Whether we adopt <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (1)</span> or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (2)</span> as the explanation of the first clause, we may understand the prophet of this clause as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">false</span> prophet who - by way of contrast if we accept <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, or by way of continuation if we prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"> (2)</span> - is like the snare of a bird-catcher over all the people's path, to entangle, entrap, and draw them into destruction <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> He is, moreover, inspired with hostility - a man of rancorous spirit against God and his true prophets. "This prophet of lies," says Aben Ezra, "is a snare of the bird-catcher." Similarly Kimchi says in his exposition, "This prophet is for Ephraim on all his ways as the snare of the bird-catcher that catcheth the fowls; so they catch Ephraim in the words of their prophets." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some understand "prophet" in the middle clause of the verse as the <span class="accented">true</span> prophet, and the snare as the hostility and traps which the people prepared for the messengers of God; so Rashi: "For the true prophets they lay snares to catch them." According to this exposition we must render, "As for the prophet, the snare of the bird-catcher is over all his ways." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> In the last clause, "house of his God," may mean the temple of the true God, or the idol-temple; thus Aben Ezra: "Enmity is in the house of his god;" while Kimchi thinks either sense admissible: "We may understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> of the house of the calves, which were his god, and the false prophet acted there as prophet, and caused enmity between himself and God; or we may explain it of the house of the true God, that is, the house of the sanctuary." Thus the hostility may refer to the prophet himself, of which he is the subject as (<span class="accented">a</span>) or the object according to Kimchi just cited, or the detestable idol-worship, or perhaps the Divine displeasure against the false prophet and the people led astray by him. <span class="cmt_word">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah.</span> The historical event here alluded to was the abominable and infamous treatment of the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah. This was the foulest blot on Israel's history during all the rule of the judges. For the loathsome particulars, <a href="//niv.scripturetext.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. may be consulted. The construction is peculiar. The two verbs <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;</span> are coordinated appositionally; "The leading verb, which in meaning is the leading one, is subordinated more palpably by being placed alongside of the preceding verb without a joining <span class="accented">and"</span> (Ewald). The former verb is often constructed with an infinitive, and sometimes with a noun. Some trace the reference, as already stated, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the enormity of the men of Gibeah in relation to the Levite's concubine; others to the election of Saul, who was of Gibeah, to be king. Rashi mentions both: "Some say it was Gibeah of Benjamin in the matter of the concubine; but others say it was Gibeah of Saul, when they demanded for themselves a king and rebelled against the words of the prophet." <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</span> The sin of Gibeah was fearfully avenged; its punishment re-suited in almost the total extinction of a tribe in Israel - that of Benjamin. And as Israel had paralleled that of the men of Gibeah, he gives them to understand first implicitly that like punishment would overtake them, then he explicitly denounces visitation for their iniquity and retribution for their sin. The clause thus closes, as it commenced, with the sad note of coming calamity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order that he might bring Egypt wholly under his power, he undertook a new expedition thither (&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, he comes again). But this expedition, like the first, was not successful (&#1499;&#1470;&#1499;, as-so, cf. <a href="/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>). For the ships of Chittim come against him. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, ships the Chittaei, for &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>, whence the expression is derived &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is Cyprus with its chief city &#x39a;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (now Chieti or Chitti); see under <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>. Ships coming from Cyprus are ships which come from the west, from the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean. In 1 Macc. 1:1 and 8:5 &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is interpreted of Macedonia, according to which Bertholdt and Dereser think of the Macedonian fleet with which the Roman embassy sailed to Alexandria. This much is historically verified, that the Roman embassy, led by Popillius, appeared with a fleet in Alexandria, and imperiously commanded Antiochus to desist from his undertaking against Egypt and to return to his own land (Liv. xlv. 10-12). The lxx have therefore translated these words by: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;  &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3b7;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, and correctly, so far as the prophecy has received the first historical accomplishment in that factum. &#1493;&#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1492;, he shall lose courage, is rightly explained by Jerome: non quod interierit, sed quod omnem arrogantiae perdiderit magnitudinem.<p>(Note: The historical facts have been briefly and conclusively brought together by Hitzig thus: "On the complaint of the Alexandrians the Roman senate sent an embassage, at the head of which was C. Popillius Laenas (Polyb. xxix. 1; Liv. xliv. 19). After being detained at Delos (Liv. xliv. 29), they set sail to Egypt after the battle at Pydna (Liv. xlv. 10). Here he met Antiochus four Roman miles from Alexandria, and presented to him the message of the senate. When Antiochus explained that he wished to lay the matter before his counsellors, Popillius described with the staff he carried on his hand a circle round the king, and commanded him to give his answer before he left this circle. Antiochus, confounded by the circumstance, submitted and withdrew from Egypt (Liv. xlv. 12; Polyb. xxix. 11; Appian, Syr. c. 66; Justin. xxxiv. 3).")<p>&#1493;&#1494;&#1506;&#1501; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, not: he was again enraged, for nothing is said of a previous &#1494;&#1506;&#1501;. &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, and he turned round (back) from his expedition against Egypt. Since he was not able to accomplish anything against the &#1504;&#1490;&#1489; (the south), he turns his indignation against Judah to destroy the covenant people (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>). The &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in <a href="/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> resumes the &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, so as further to express how he gave vent to his anger. Hitzig's interpretation of the first &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; of the return to Palestine, of the second, of the return from Palestine to Antiochus, is not justified. &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1503;, he shall observe, direct his attention to the Jews who forsook the holy covenant, i.e., the apostate Jews, that he might by their help execute his plans against the Mosaic religion - partim ornando illos honoribus, partim illorum studiis ad patriam religionem obliterandam comparatis obsecundando, as C. B. Michaelis excellently remarks; cf. 1 Macc. 1:11-16 with 2:18. </body></html>
