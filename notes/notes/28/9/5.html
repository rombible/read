When you shall find yourselves far from your own country, without temple, without prophets, without priests, without sacrifices, without solemn assemblies; what will be your sentiments? You will doubtless be willing to abstain from labour on those days, as you were wont to do; but your masters will not permit that, but force you to your wonted employments. Though the Israelites of the ten tribes were schismatics, and did not go up to the temple at Jerusalem, they omitted not to celebrate, in their own manner, the feasts of the Lord in their own country; and as these solemnities were always accompanied with festivity and rejoicing, it must have been a great mortification to them to be no longer able to celebrate them in the land of their captivity: see Calmet. <span class="ital">For lo, they are gone because of destruction — </span>Some are already withdrawn, because of the desolation that cometh. A great many of the ten tribes fled into Egypt, when they saw their country laid waste by the Assyrians. The prophet here threatens these, that they should have no better a fate than their brethren who were carried away into Assyria; but should die in Egypt, and never see their native country any more. <span class="ital">Egypt shall gather them up — </span>Or, <span class="ital">gather them, </span>as the word is translated <a href="/ezekiel/29-5.htm" title="And I will leave you thrown into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall on the open fields; you shall not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given you for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.">Ezekiel 29:5</a>. It signifies the same in both places, as if it had been said they should be buried there. <span class="ital">The pleasant places, &c., nettles shall possess them — </span>Their fine houses, which they have purchased at vast prices, shall be ruined, and lie in rubbish till they be overrun with nettles. This signified a vast desolation. These two verses are thus translated by Bishop Horsley: “What will ye do for the season of solemn assembly, and for the festival of Jehovah? Behold, all are gone! Total devastation! Egypt shall gather them. Memphis shall bury them. Their valuables of silver! The nettle shall dispossess them, and the thistle, in their dwellings.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-6 Israel gave rewards to their idols, in the offerings presented to them. It is common for those who are niggardly in religion, to be prodigal upon their lusts. Those are reckoned as idolaters, who love a reward in the corn-floor better than a reward in the favour of God and in eternal life. They are full of the joy of harvest, and have no disposition to mourn for sin. When we make the world, and the things of it, our idol and our portion, it is just with God to show us our folly, and correct us. None may expect to dwell in the Lord's land, who will not be subject to the Lord's laws, or be influenced by his love. When we enjoy the means of grace, we ought to consider what we shall do, if they should be taken from us. While the pleasures of communion with God are out of the reach of change, the pleasant places purchased with silver, or in which men deposit silver, are liable to be laid in ruins. No famine is so dreadful as that of the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What will ye do in the solemn day? - Man is content to remain far from God, so that God do not show him, that He has withdrawn Himself from him. Man would fain have the power of drawing near to God in time of calamity, or when he himself likes. He would fain have God at his command, as it were, not be at the command of God. God cuts off this hope altogether. he singles out the great festivals, which commemorated His great doings for His people, as though they had no more share in those mercies. The more solemn the day, the more total man's exclusion, the more manifest God's withdrawal. To one shut out from His service, the days of deepest religious joy became the days of deepest sorrow. Mirth is turned into heaviness. To be deprived of the ordinary daily sacrifice was a source of continual sorrow; how much more, "in the days of" their "gladness" <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>, in which they were bidden to rejoice before the Lord, and "in which they seemed to have a nearer and more familiar access to God." True, that having separated themselves from the temple, they had no right to celebrate these feasts, which were to be held in the place "which God had chosen to place His name there." Man, however, clings to the shadow of God's service, when he has parted with the substance. And so God foretold them before, that He would "make all their mirth to cease" <a href="/hosea/2-11.htm">Hosea 2:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

Is this imaginable? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hosea/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord? Since their sacrifices now were so disagreeable and displeasing to the Lord, and so unavailable to themselves, what would they do when in captivity, "in the solemn day", the seventh day of the week, appointed by the Lord for rest and religious worship; and in the first day of the month, which also was to be solemnly observed, by offering sacrifice, &amp;c. and on feast days of the Lord's instituting, as the feasts of the passover, pentecost; and tabernacles? seeing those that carried and held them captive would not allow them time for such solemnities; nor would they be furnished with proper sacrifices; nor could they be accommodated with a proper place to offer them at; nor be able, in a strange land, and under hardships and miseries, to express that joy that is suitable to such occasions: thus should they learn, by sad experience, the want of those means and opportunities of serving the Lord, which in their own land they rejected and despised. Jarchi and Kimchi interpret this of the destruction of Israel, and of punishment inflicted on them at the time appointed by the Lord; and which would be a solemn time, a feast with the Lord, to which he should invite their enemies, and they should spill their blood as the blood of sacrifices; and when he would display the glory of his justice, truth, and faithfulness, before all the world. And it is asked, what will you do then? whither will you flee for help? or what sacrifice can you offer up to the Lord to atone for sin, or appease his wrath? will you be able to rejoice then? no, your joy will be turned into mourning; see <a href="/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What will ye do <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</span><p>(f) When the Lord will take away all the occasions of serving him, which will be the most grievous part of your captivity, when you will see yourselves cut off from God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">What will ye do</span>, &c.] The festivals, which were kept up in N.

Returning from Egypt with great riches, i.e., with rich spoil, he raises his heart against the holy covenant. By the potentialis &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; (he shall return) this new undertaking is placed in the point of view of a divine decree, to denote that he thereby brings about his own destruction. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; signifies not the holy people in covenant with God (v. Lengerke, Maurer, and many older interpreters), but the divine institution of the Old Covenant, the Jewish Theocracy. The Jews are only members of this covenant, cf. <a href="/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>. Calvin is right when he says: Mihi simplicior sensus probatur, quod scilicet bellum gerat adversus Deum. The holy covenant is named instead of the covenant people to represent the undertaking as an outrage against the kingdom of God, which was founded in Israel. &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, and he shall do, perform, that which his heart thinks, or that which he has in his mind against the holy covenant.
