It held out a siege of three years, which probably provoked Shalmaneser to treat it with the severity which he used, when he made himself master of it. The only difficulty in this verse is, what place or person is alluded to by the words, <span class="ital">as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle. </span>It is supposed that by Shalman is meant Shalmaneser; and that Beth-arbel was a place in Armenia which he took and spoiled, putting the inhabitants to the sword without any distinction either of age or sex. But it cannot be said with certainty, that this supposition is founded on fact. Some other conquest, by some other person, might possibly be meant. But it is not material to know this. It was some place which had been treated with great severity by the conqueror, and such treatment the prophet denounces Samaria should meet with. It is worthy of remark, however, that the Vulgate, St. Jerome, and the LXX. (see the Alexandrine MS.) suppose that the history alluded to is Gideon’s destruction of Zalmunna. <span class="ital">So shall Beth-el do unto you — </span>“This is the fruit of your worshipping the golden calves at Beth-el and Dan. As it happened to the city above mentioned, so shall it happen to you, because of your iniquities.” <span class="ital">In a morning — </span>That is, suddenly, quickly, and unexpectedly; or after a night of adversity, when they thought the morning of prosperity was come; <span class="ital">shall the king of Israel be cut off — </span>And the whole state and government of Israel be put an end to along with him. This seems to be spoken of Hoshea, the last king of Israel, who, in the sixth year of his reign, was shut up in prison by the king of Assyria, who, in three years more, made himself master of the whole kingdom of Israel, and carried the inhabitants of it into captivity. The Vulgate, (which, with the LXX. and the Syriac, carries this clause to the next chapter,) instead of <span class="greekheb">בשׁחר</span>, <span class="ital">in the morning, </span>seems to have read <span class="greekheb">כשׁחר</span>, <span class="ital">as the morning, </span>rendering the clause, <span class="ital">sicut mane transit, pertransit rex Israel: </span>“As the morning passes away, so passes away the king of Israel.” This reading Bishop Horsley adopts, and translates to nearly the same sense, thus: <span class="ital">As the morning is brought to nothing, to nothing shall the king of Israel be brought: </span>observing, “The sudden and total destruction of the monarchy of the ten tribes is compared to the sudden and total extinction of the beauties of the dawn in the sky, by the instantaneous diffusion of the solar light: by which the ruddy streaks in the east, the glow of orange-coloured light upon the horizon, are at once obliterated, absorbed, and lost in the colourless light of day. The change is sudden even in these climates; it must be more sudden in the tropical; and in all it is one of the most complete that nature presents.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:9-15 Because God does not desire the death and ruin of sinners, therefore in mercy he desires their chastisement. The children of iniquity still remained in Israel. The enemies would be gathered against them. It is just with God to make those know what hardships mean, who indulge themselves in ease and pleasure. Let them cleanse their hearts from all corrupt affections and lusts, and be a broken and contrite spirit. Let them abound in works of piety towards God, and of justice and charity towards one another: herein let them sow to the Spirit. Seeking the Lord is to be every day's work, but there are special occasions when to seek him. Christ shall come as the Lord our righteousness, and grant us of it abundantly. If we sow in righteousness, we shall reap according to mercy; a reward not of debt, but of grace. Even the gains of sin yield the sinner no satisfaction. As our comforts, so our confidences in the service of sin will certainly fail us. Come and seek the Lord, and thy hope in him shall not deceive thee. See what cruel work war makes. Whatever mischief is done, it is sin that does it. What miseries men's sins bring on them, even in this world!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye have plowed wickedness - They not only did not that which God commanded, but they did the exact contrary. They cultivated wickedness. They broke up their fallow ground, yet to sow, not wheat, but tares. They did not leave it even to grow of itself, although even thus, on the natural soil of the human heart, it yields a plenteous harvest; but they bestowed their labor on it, plowed it, sowed, and as they sowed, so they reaped, an abundant increase of it. "They brought their ill doings to a harvest, and laid up as in provision the fruits thereof." Iniquity and the results of iniquity, were the gain of all their labor. Of all their toil, they shall have no fruits, except the iniquity itself. : "By the plowing, sowing, eating the fruits, he marks the obstinacy of incorrigible sinners, who begin ill, go on to worse, and in the worst come to an end. Then too, when the corrupted soul labors with the purpose of a deed of sin, and resolves in its inmost thoughts, how it may bring the ungodly will into effect in deed, it is like one plowing or sowing. But when, having completed the work of iniquity, it exults that it has done ill, it is like one reaping. When further it has broken out so far as, in pride of heart to defend its sins against the law of God prohibiting them, and goes on unconcerned in impenitence, he is like one who, after harvest, eats the fruits stored up."<p>Ye have eaten the fruit of lies - They had been full of "lies" <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-3.htm">Hosea 7:3</a>; they had "lied" against God by hypocrisy <a href="/hosea/5-7.htm">Hosea 5:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-16.htm">Hosea 7:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a> and idolatry; they had "spoken lies against Him" <a href="/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>; by denying that He gave them what He bestowed upon them, and ascribing it to their idols <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>. All iniquity is a lie. Such then should be "the fruit" which they tasted, on which they fed. It should not profit, nor satisfy them. It should not merely be empty, as in the case of those who are said to "feed on ashes" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-20.htm">Isaiah 44:20</a>, but hurtful. As Isaiah saith, "they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity. They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed, breaketh out into a viper" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm">Isaiah 59:4-5</a>. "Gain deceives, lust deceives, gluttony deceives; they yield no true delight; they satisfy not, they disgust; and they end in misery of body and soul." "Bodily delights," says a father , "when absent, kindle a vehement longing; when had and eaten, they satiate and disgust the eater. Spiritual delights are distasteful, when unknown; when possessed, they are longed for; and the more those who hunger after them feed upon them, the more they are hungered for. Bodily delights please, untasted; when tasted, they displease; spiritual, when untasted, are held cheap; when experienced, they please. In bodily delights, appetite generates satiety; satiety, disgust. In spiritual, appetite produceth satiety; satiety appetite. For spiritual delights increase longing in the soul, while they satisfy. For the more their sweetness is perceived, so much the more is "that" known which is loved more eagerly. Unpossessed, they cannot be loved, because their sweetness is unknown."<p>Because thou didst trust in thy way - "Thy way," i. e., not God's. They forsook God's way, followed "ways of wickedness and misbelief." While displeasing God, they trusted in the worship of the calves and in the help of Egypt and Assyria, "making flesh their arm, and departing from the living God." So long as a man mistrusts his ways of sin, there is hope of his conversion amid any depths of sin. When "he trusts in his ways," all entrance is closed against the grace of God. He is as one dead; he not only justifies himself, but is self-justified. There is nothing in him, neither love nor fear, which can be awakened. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. reaped iniquity&#8212;that is, the fruit of iniquity; as "righteousness" (Ho 10:12) is "the fruit of righteousness" (Job 4:8; Pr 22:8; Ga 6:7, 8).<p>lies&#8212;false and spurious worship.<p>trust in thy way&#8212;thy perverse way (Isa 57:10; Jer 2:23), thy worship of false gods.

Hitherto their work had been wickedness, and their wages, as might be expected, the fruit of iniquity. What they had wrought for they reaped. Their plowing had been sin, their sowing wickedness, and their harvest sorrow. Wickedness against God and man was what they both ploughed and sowed; oppression at the hand of their enemies was the harvest or reward of iniquity which they reaped. Their lies, including their idolatry in reference to God, disloyalty to their king, their false words and false works with one another, bore fruit, bitter fruit, sour fruit, and they were obliged to eat that fruit till their teeth were set on edge. Thus Kimchi explains it: "After the plowing follows the sowing, and both of them are a figurative representation of work, as we have explained it. The prophet says, 'Ye have done the opposite of that which I commanded you, when I said, Sow to yourselves in righteousness.'" The harvest is the reward of the work done; the genitive is expressive of contents - that in which the fruit consists; the fruit of lies against God is the fruit which disappoints those who wait for it <span class="accented">Ki</span> directs attention to the ground of Israel's gradual declension and final destruction; the two fundamental errors, or rather evils, that led on to Israel's ruin, were apostasy from Jehovah and sinful self-confidence. Sunk in idolatry, they no longer looked to Jehovah as the Source of their power and strength; while they pursued their own ways, confident of the excellence of their own sagacity and foresight. <span class="cmt_word">Because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</span> They had placed their confidence in the wisdom of their own ways - their prudent plans and wise counsels; in the heroism of their soldiers and the excellence of their preparations of war. By these means they fancied themselves independent of the Almighty, and sufficiently defended against their enemies. "Thou hast trusted," says Kimchi, in his exposition, "to thine own way which thou goest; and that is the way of iniquity and of confidence in evil; and in like manner thou hast trusted in the multitude of thy men of war which thou hast had among thine own people, or among the Egyptians, from whom they sought help, and thou hast made flesh thine arm, and not trusted in me; therefore thou hast stumbled." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel heard his answer, but he understood it not. To &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, as to &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1488;, the object is wanting, because it can easily be supplied from the connection, namely, the meaning of the answer of the man clothed in linen. Grotius has incorrectly supplied quid futurum esset from the following question, in which he has also incorrectly rendered &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; by post illiu triennii et temporis semestris spatium. Hvernick has also defined the object too narrowly, for he has referred the non-understanding merely to the mysterious number (a time, two times, etc.). It was, besides, not merely the double designation of time in <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a> which first at the hour of his receiving it, but while it was yet unintelligible to the hearer, compelled Daniel, as Hitzig thinks, to put the further question. The whole answer in <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a> is obscure. It gives no measure for the "times," and thus no intelligible disclosure for the prophet regarding the duration of the end, and in the definition, that at the time of the deepest humiliaton of the people the end shall come, leaves wholly undefined when this shall actually take place.<p>(Note: As to this latter circumstance L'Empereur remarks: Licet Daniel ex antecedentibus certo tempus finiendarum gravissimarum calamitatum cognoverit, tamen illum latuit, quo temporis articulo calamitas inceptura esset: quod ignorantiam quandam in tota prophetia peperit, cum a priori termino posterioris exacta scientia dependeret. Initium quidem variis circumstantiis definitum fuerat: sed quando circumstantiae futurae essent, antequam evenirent, ignorabatur.)<p>Hence his desire for a more particular disclosure.<p>The question, "what the end of these?" is very differently interpreted. Following the example of Grotius, Kliefoth takes &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; in the sense of that which follows something which is either clearly seen from the connection or is expressly stated, and explains &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; of that which follows or comes after this. But &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is not, with most interpreters, to be taken as identical with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; of <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>; for since "this latter phrase includes all the things prophesied of down to the consummation, then would this question refer to what must come after the absolute consummation of all things, which would be meaningless." Besides, the answer, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm">Daniel 12:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-12.htm">Daniel 12:12</a>, which relates to the things of Antiochus, would not harmonize with such a question. Much more are we, with Auberlen (p. 75f.), to understand &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; of the present things and circumstances, things then in progress at the time of Daniel and the going forth of the prophecy. In support of this interpretation Auberlen adds, "The angel with heavenly eye sees into the far distant end of all; the prophet, with human sympathies, regards the more immediate future of his people." But however correct the remark, that &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is not identical with &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, this not identical with all this, there is no warrant for the conclusion drawn from it, that &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; designates the present things and circumstances existing under Antiochus at the time of Daniel. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; must, by virtue of the connection in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-8.htm">Daniel 12:8</a>, be understood of the same things and circumstances, and a distinction between the two is established only by &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;. If we consider this distinction, then the question, What is the last of these things? contains not the meaningless thought, that yet something must follow after the absolute consummation, but the altogether reasonable thought, Which shall be the last of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; prophesied of? Thus Daniel could ask in the hope of receiving an answer from which he might learn the end of all these &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; more distinctly than from the answer given by the angel in <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>. But as this reference of &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; to the present things and circumstances is excluded by the connection, so also is the signification attributed to &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, of that which follows something, verbally inadmissible; see under <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>.<p>Most other interpreters have taken &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; as synonymous with &#1511;&#1509;, which Hvernick seeks to establish by a reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>. But none of these passage establishes this identity. &#1511;&#1509; is always thus distinguished from &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, that it denotes a matter after its conclusion, while &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; denotes the last or the uttermost of the matter. A distinction which, it is true, may in many cases become irrelevant. For if this distinction is not noticed here, we would be under the necessity, in order to maintain that the two questions in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-8.htm">Daniel 12:8</a> are not altogether identical, of giving to &#1502;&#1492; the meaning qualis (Maurer), of what nature (Hofmann, v. Lengerke, and others); a meaning which it has not, and which does not accord with the literal idea of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;. "Not how? but what? is the question; &#1502;&#1492; is not the predicate, but the subject, the thing inquired about." Thus Hitzig, who is altogether correct in thus stating the question: "What, i.e., which even its the uttermost, the last of the &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, which stands before the end?" </body></html>
