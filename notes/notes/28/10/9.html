Such sin had continued ever since, so that, although God, in His longsuffering, had hitherto spared them, "it was not of late only that they had deserved those judgments, although now at last only, God inflicted them." "There" in Gibeah, "they stood." Although smitten twice at Gibeah, and heavily chastened, there they were avengers of the sacredness of God's law, and, in the end, "they stood; chastened but not killed." But now, none of the ten tribes took the side of God. Neither zeal for God, nor the greatness of the guilt, nor fear of judgment, nor the peril of utter ruin, induced any to set themselves against sin so great. The sin devised by one, diffused among the many, was burnt and branded into them, so that they never parted with it. : "The battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them," i. e., it did not overtake them then, but it shall overtake them now. Or if we render, (as is more probable,) "shall not overtake them," it will mean, not a battle like that in Gibeah, terrible as that was, "shall" now "overtake them;" but one far worse. For, although the tribe of Benjamin was then reduced to six hundred men, yet the tribe still survived and flourished again; now the kingdom of the ten tribes, and the name of Ephraim, should be utterly blotted out. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

This has no respect, as the Targum, and others, to Gibeah of Saul, of which place he was, and the choosing him to be king; but to the affair of the Levite and his concubine at Gibeah in the days of the judges, and what followed upon it, <a href="/judges/19-1.htm">Judges 19:1</a>; suggesting, that the sins of Israel were not new ones; they were the same with what were committed formerly, as early as the history referred to, and had been continued ever since; the measure of which were now filling up: or, as Aben Ezra and Abarbinel interpret it, "thou hast sinned more than the days of Gibeah"; were guilty of more idolatry, inhumanity, and impurity, than in those times; and yet the grossest of sins, particularly unnatural lusts, were then committed: <p>there they stood; either the men of Gibeah continued in their sins, and did not repent of them; and stood in their own defence against the tribes of Israel, and the Benjamites stood also with them, and by them; and stood two battles, and were conquerors in them; and, though beaten in the third, were not wholly destroyed, as now the Israelites would be: or the tribes of Israel stood, and continued in, and connived at, the idolatry of the Levite; or rather stood sluggish and slothful, and were not eagar to fight with the Benjamites, who took part with the men of Gibeah; which were their sins, for which they were worsted in the two first battles, and in which the present Israelites imitated them: <p>the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them; the two first battles against the men of Gibeah and the Benjamites, who are the children of iniquity, the one the actors, and the other the abettors and patrons of it, did not succeed against them, but the Israelites were overcome; and the third battle, in which they got the day, did not overtake them so as utterly to cut them off; for six hundred persons made their escape; but, in the present case prophesied of, it is suggested, that as their sins were as great or greater than theirs, their ruin should be entire and complete: or the sense is, that they were backward to go to battle; they were not eager upon it; they did not at once espouse the cause of the Levite; they did not stir in it till he had done that unheard of thing, cutting his concubine into twelve pieces, and sending them to the twelve tribes of Israel; and then they were not overly anxious, but sought the Lord, as if it was a doubtful case; which backwardness was resented in their ill success at first; and the same slow disposition to punish vice had continued with them ever since; so Schmidt. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O Israel, thou hast <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> overtake them.</span><p>(k) In those days you were as wicked as the Gibeonites, as God there partly declared: for your zeal could not be good in executing God's judgments, seeing your own deeds were as wicked as theirs.<p>(l) That is, to fight, or, the Israelites remained in that stubbornness from that time.<p>(m) The Israelites were not moved by the example of the Gibeonites to cease from their sins.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">thou hast sinned</span> …] The prophet’s language is correct from his own point of view.

A fresh demonstration of Israel’s guiltiness. The prevalent depravity is comparable only to that of the men of Gibeah (see on <a href="/hosea/9-9.htm" title="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.">Hosea 9:9</a>). ‘The times are out of joint’; all Israel’s doings are against nature, and the retribution must be equally exceptional.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah.</span> Two explanations given of this clause - namely, that which understands, <span class="accented">rain</span> comparatively, that is, "more than" - their sins were greater than those of the Benjamites in the days of Gibeah; and that which refers the sin here spoken of to the appointment of Saul, who was of Gibeah of Benjamin, to be king - must be unhesitatingly rejected. Tile sin of the men of Gibeah was the shameful outrage committed on the Levite's concubine by the men of Gibeah, which with its consequences is recorded in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. and 20. That sin became proverbial, overtopping, as it did, all ordinary iniquities by its shameless atrocity and heinousness. By along-continued course of sin, even from ancient days, Ephraim has been preparing for a fearful doom. <span class="cmt_word">There they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</span> This portion of the verse is not a little perplexing, and in consequence has called forth considerable diversity of exposition. There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that which is implied in the Authorized Version, viz. "there they <span class="accented">stood</span>," smitten twice but not destroyed, chastened but not killed, the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them then so as utterly to destroy them, but it shall overtake them now. Or if the verb "overtake," which is future, be strictly rendered, the meaning is - Not a battle like that in Gibeah against the children of iniquity shall overtake them, but one much more sanguinary and terrible, resulting, not in the reduction of a single tribe to six hundred men, but in the extirpation of ten tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of Keil and others, though not the same, is similar. It is: "There, in Gibea, did they <span class="accented">remain</span>, persevering in the sin of Gibeah, and yet the war in Gibeah against the sinners has not overtaken them." This makes the meaning of the prophet to be that since the days of Gibeah the Israelites persevered in the same or like sin as the Gibeahites; and, though the Gibeahites were so severely punished, actually destroyed, because of their sin, the ten tribes of Israel, persisting in the same or similar sin, have not yet been resisted with any such exterminating war. Jehovah announces his intention now to visit them with punishment and severest chastisement for all. The meaning which Keil aims at may be better brought out by rendering the latter clause interrogatively; thus: "There they stood - persisting in the criminality of Gibeah - shall there not overtake them, living as they do in Gibeah, the war which exterminated the children of crime?" It is admitted that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> may have been the meaning of "persevering;" but a better sense <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is gained by Wunsche referring the subject of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span> to the Benjamites; the suffix of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span> to the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, or "children of iniquity," that is, their guilty tribesmen in Gibeah; taking the intermediate clause parenthetically; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> to "stand in defense of;" thus: "Since the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned, O Israel: there they (the Benjamites) stood in defense of the children of iniquity, that the war might not reach them in Gibeah." This gives a satisfactory sense, and intimates that, by a long-continued course of iniquity and crime, the Ephraimites were preparing themselves for a fearful fate. Already from days long gone by grievous guilt cleaved to them; thus in the days of Gibeah they (the Benjamites) stood by their iniquitous brethren that the battle in Gibeah might not reach them. As this was before the disruption, the Benjamites were part and parcel of Israel here represented by them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller's explanation is the following: "They (the Benjamites) <span class="accented">survived</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, as in <a href="/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>) being severely punished, though they did not entirely perish, six hundred being left to revive the tribe." But a still severer punishment awaits the Israelites (the person being changed from the second to the third, and the prophet addressing himself to hearer or reader): not the war waged in Gibeah (or on account of the crime committed there) against the children of iniquity shall overtake them, but a far more deadly and destructive war.

Accordingly, also, &#1505;&#1514;&#1503; is obviously to be interpreted in the meaning illustrated and defended under <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>, to shut up in the sense of guarding; and thus also &#1495;&#1514;&#1501;, to seal. Thus all the objections against this command are set aside which Hitzig has derived from the sealing, which he understands of the sealing up of the book, so that he may thereby cast doubt on the genuineness of the book.<p>It is disputed whether &#1492;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; is only the last revelation, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10-12</a> (Hvernick, v. Leng., Maurer, Kran.), or the whole book (Bertholdt, Hitzig, Auberlen, Kliefoth). That &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; might designate a short connected portion, a single prophecy, is placed beyond a doubt by <a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63</a>. The parallelism of the members of the passage also appears to favour the opinion that &#1492;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; stands in the same meaning as &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. But this appearance amounts to a valid argument only under the supposition that the last revelation stands unconnected with the revelations going before. But since this is not the case, much rather the revelation of these chapters is not only in point of time the last which Daniel received, but also forms the essential conclusion of all earlier revelations, then the expression used of the sealing of this last revelation refers plainly to the sealing of the whole book. This supposition is unopposed. That the writing down of the prophecy is not commanded to Daniel, cannot be objected against. As this is here and in <a href="/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a> presupposed as a matter of course, for the receiving of a revelation without committing it to writing is not practicable, so we may without hesitation suppose that Daniel wrote down all the earlier visions and revelations as soon as he received them, so that with the writing down of the last of them the whole book was completed. For these reasons we understand by &#1492;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; the whole book. For, as Kliefoth rightly remarks, the angel will close, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, the last revelation, and along with it the whole prophetical work of Daniel, and dismiss him from his prophetical office, as he afterwards, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13</a>, does, after he has given him, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-5.htm">Daniel 12:5-12</a>, disclosures regarding the periods of these wonderful things that were announced. He must seal the book, i.e., guard it securely from disfigurement, "till the time of the end," because its contents stretch out to the time of the end. Cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>, where the reason for the sealing is stated in the words, "for yet it shall be for many days." Instead of such a statement as that, the time of the end is here briefly named as the terminus, down to which the revelation reaches, in harmony with the contents of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40-12:3</a>, which comprehend the events of the time of the end.<p>The two clauses of <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a> are differently explained. The interpretation of J. D. Michaelis, "Many shall indeed go astray, but on the other side also the knowledge shall be great," is verbally just as untenable as that of Hvernick, "Many shall wander about, i.e., in the consciousness of their misery, strive after salvation, knowledge." For &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496; signifies neither to go astray (errare) nor to wander about, but only to go to and fro, to pass through a land, in order to seek out or search, to go about spying (<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, of the eyes of God; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>, to row). From these renderings there arises for this passage before us the meaning, to search through, to examine, a book; not merely to "read industriously" (Hitzig, Ewald), but thoroughly to search into it (Gesenius). The words do not supply the reason for the command to seal, but they state the object of the sealing, and are not (with many interpreters) to be referred merely to the time of the end, that then for the first time many shall search therein and find great knowledge. This limiting of their import is connected with the inaccurate interpretation of the sealing as a figure either of the incomprehensibility of the prophecy or of the secrecy of the writing, and is set aside with the correct interpretation of this figure. If Daniel, therefore, must only place the prophecy securely that it may continue to the time of the end, the sealing thus does not exclude the use of it in transcriptions, then there exists no reason for thinking that the searching into it will take place only for the first time in the end. The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468; are not connected with the preceding by any particle or definition of time, whereby they should be limited to &#1511;&#1509; &#1506;&#1514;. To this is to be added, that this revelation, according to the express explanation of the angel (<a href="/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>), refers to all that shall be experienced by the people of Daniel from the time of Cyrus to the time of the end. If, then, it must remain sealed or not understood till the time of the end, it must have lain unused and useless for centuries, while it was given for the very purpose of reflecting light on the ways of God for the pious in all times, and of imparting consolation amid their tribulations to those who continued stedfast in their fidelity. In order to serve these purposes it must be accessible at all times, so that they might be able to search into it, to judge events by it and to strengthen their faith. Kliefoth therefore is right in his thus interpreting the whole passage: "Daniel must place in security the prophecies he has received until the time of the end, so that through all times many men may be able to read them and gain understanding (better: obtain knowledge) from them." &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; is the knowledge of the ways of the Lord with His people, which confirms them in their fidelity towards God. </body></html>
