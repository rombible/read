Their pretences to covenant with God were false. Even the proceeding of justice was as poisonous hemlock. Alas, how empty a vine is the visible church even at this day!

Such is the result of all their oaths and covenants, that "judgment springeth up," yea, flourisheth; but, what judgment? Judgment, bitter and poisonous as hemlock, flourishes, as hemlock would flourish on ground broken up and prepared for it. They break up the ground, make the "furrows." They will not have any chance self-sown seed; they prepare the soil for harvest, full, abundant, regular, cleared of all besides. And what harvest? Not any wholesome plant, but poison. They cultivate injustice and wickedness, as if these were to be the fruits to be rendered to God from His own land.

The plant in question (Heb. <span class="ital">rôsh</span>) is often referred to, and cannot be identified with precision (see on <a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm" title="Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defended cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:14</a>); most think it is some umbelliferous plant, <span class="ital">rôsh</span> being the common word for ‘head.’ Elsewhere its bitterness is the point of comparison (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-19.htm" title="Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.">Lamentations 3:19</a>); here its abundant growth as well. Hence some have been led to render, continuing the description of the immorality of Israel, ‘and justice springs up like the poppy’, i.e., understanding the passage ironically, acts of hurtful injustice are as luxuriantly abundant as that noxious weed, comp. <a href="/amos/6-12.htm" title="Shall horses run on the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for you have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:">Amos 6:12</a>.

The judgment began with the man who was foremost in those illegitimate covenants—with the prophet’s royal namesake (Hoshea); see <a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm" title="And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.">2 Kings 17:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God, by the prophet, had charged Israel with fruitlessness</span>, or with bringing forth fruit to themselves; with perverting the bounties of his providence in promoting idolatry; with their division of heart, or deceitfulness of heart. He had also threatened to punish them for their sin, and to deprive them of the means of sinning by destroying the instruments thereof, and to prevent their obtaining any help from their king, proving to them the folly of depending on him. He now proceeds, in this and following verses (4-8), to point out their moral corruption, the usual consequence or concomitant of irreligion and of false religion, instancing their deceptive dealing in the common affairs of life and their perjury in public compacts or covenants, as also their general unrighteousness. He threatens to destroy their idols to the distress of their worshippers and ministering priests as well as of their chief city. He threatens further to cause their calf-idols to be carried into captivity, pouring shame and contempt on their enterprises; to cut off their king; to leave the places of their idol-worship desolate, filling the people with distress and despair because of all their sins. <span class="cmt_word">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant.</span> In this fourth verse the prophet deplores the absence of truth, faithfulness, and loyalty to duty. This expression, "they have spoken words," is generally understood to signify <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "empty words," "false words," only words and no more, like the Latin <span class="accented">verba alicui dare</span>. Thus their vain, deceitful, lying words in private transactions and common affairs of everyday life would correspond to their perjury in public treaties and covenants. Their words were deceitful and their oaths falsehood. In their ordinary business transactions they used words, empty words, words without truth, corresponding thereto; in international concerns they had pursued the same course of falsifying and covenant-breaking. After entering into an engagement with the Assyrian king Shalmaneser, they made a covenant with So King of Egypt, as we read in <a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>, "<span class="accented">And</span> the King of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So King of Egypt, and brought no present to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year." In this latter case they acted as covenant-breakers, and at the same time contravened the Divine command, which forbade them entering into covenants with foreigners. The first clause, however, is understood by some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in the sense of "deliberating.' Thus Kimchi understands it, erroneously referring it to Jeroboam and his countrymen; thus: "<span class="accented">Jeroboam</span> and his companions took counsel what they should do in order to strengthen the government in his hand, and they deliberated (or held consultation) that the people should not go up to Jerusalem to the house of the sanctuary; and for this purpose they bound themselves by oath and made a covenant. But their oath was a vain one, because their oath was intended to frustrate the words of the Law and the command of God, and to make images for their worship." The words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d5;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;</span> have been explained by some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">as</span> "<span class="accented">oaths</span> of vanity," that is, oaths by vanity or an idol, as an oath of Jehovah is an oath by Jehovah, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> being taken for a noun in the plural; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as predicate, while the following words supply the subject; thus: "their covenant contracts are oaths of vanity." This mistake of taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> for a noun arose from the anomalous form of the word, which is really a verb. The form is explained by Aben Ezra, who calls it an irregular formation, as if it were compounded of the infinitive construct as indicated by the ending <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and the infinitive absolute as indicated by the <span class="accented">qamets</span> in the first syllable; it is in reality the infinitive absolute, and the irregularity is owing to the assonance with <span class="accented">karoth</span> thence resulting. As to the <span class="accented">construction</span>, it is that of the infinitive standing in place of the finite verb, of which Gesenius says, "This is frequent... in the expression of several successive acts or states, where only the first of the verbs employed takes the required form in respect to tense and person, the others being simply put in the infinitive with the same tense and person implied." The meaning of the clause is obviously that there was no longer any respect for the sanctity of an oath; while the treaties refer to those made with the Assyrian king, with the object of securing and upholding the government. <span class="cmt_word">Thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span> The judgment here spoken of is understood <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the Hebrew interpreters, following the Chaldee Version, as the judgment of God and consequent punishment of Israel because of sin; thus Kinchi: "<span class="accented">Therefore</span> there springs up against them the judgment of chastisements and punishments like hemlock, which is a bitter herb that springs up on the furrows of the field." Some, again, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> explain it of the decree of the kings of Israel in reference to the worship of idols, which, like a bitter herb, was to issue in national ruin. We much prefer <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the more obvious sense of the clause which refers it to the perversion of judgment and justice. Thus Amos addresses them as those who "turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteous<span class="accented">ness</span> in the earth," and calls on them to "<span class="accented">establish</span> judgment in the gate;" and Habakkuk writes, "<span class="accented">Wrong</span> [wrested] judgment proceedeth." It is implied in the mention of <span class="accented">furrows</span> that there has been careful preparation for the intended crop. The seed they sow is injustice; and the plant that springs up from it is a poison-plant - hemlock, bitter and noxious, and is everywhere rampant. Another <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> explanation understands "judgment" in the sense of crime which calls on judgment for punishment. The field is that of the Israelitish nation; in all the furrows of that wide field judgment, that is, crime, springs up as luxuriantly and abundantly as hemlock. The multiplication of crime in Israel, like a luxurious noxious growth in some large field, is the idea thus conveyed. This explanation has the appearance at least of being somewhat strained and forced, though it yields a good sense. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The End of the Hostile King<p>As has been already seen, the expressions in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40-43</a> regarding this king do not agree with Antiochus Epiphanes, so also the statements regarding his end are in contradiction to the historical facts regarding the end of the Syrian king. When the hostile king took possession of Egypt and its treasures, and made the Lybians and Cushites subject to him, tidings from the east and the north overwhelm him with terror. The masc. &#1497;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; stands ad sensum related to the persons who occasion the reports. The reports excited his anger, so that he goes forth to destroy many. We have to think thus on the reports of revolt and insurrections in the east and the north of his kingdom, which came to his ears in Egypt. On this ground Hitzig, with other interpreters, refuses to refer the statement in <a href="/daniel/11-44.htm">Daniel 11:44</a> to the expedition of Antiochus against the Parthians and Armenians (Tacit. hist. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-8.htm">Daniel 11:8</a>, and App. Syr. c. 45, 46; 1 Macc. 3:37), because Antiochus did not undertake this expedition from Egypt; and rather, in regard to the east, thinks on the tidings from Jerusalem of the rebellion of Judea (2 Macc. 5:11ff.; 1 Macc. 1:24), and in regard to the north, on the very problematical expedition against the Aradiaei, without observing, however, that no Scripture writer designates Jerusalem as lying in the east of Egypt, But besides, Antiochus, since he has occupied for some years beyond the Euphrates, and there met with his death, could not shortly before his end lead an expedition out of Egypt against Aradus. What Porphyry says<p>(Note: The words are: Pugnans contra Aegyptios et Lybias, Aethiopiasque pertransiens, audiet sibi ab aquilone et oriente praelia concitari, unde et regrediens capit Aradios resistentes et omnem in littore Phoenicis vastavit provinciam; confestimque pergit ad Artaxiam regem Armeniae, qui de orientis partibus movebatur.)<p>(in Jerome under <a href="/daniel/11-44.htm">Daniel 11:44</a>) regarding an expedition of Antiochus undertaken from Egypt and Lybia against the Aradiaei and the Armenian king Artaxias, he has gathered only from this verse and from notices regarding the wars of Antiochus against the Aradiaei and king Artaxias (after whose imprisonment, according to App. Syr. c. 46, he died), without having any historical evidence for it. But even though the statement of Porphyry were better established, yet it would not agree with <a href="/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>; for when the king goes forth, in consequence of the report brought to him, to destroy many, he plants, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>, his palace-tent near to the holy mount, and here comes to his end; thus meeting with his destruction in the Holy Land not far from Jerusalem, while Antiochus, according to Polybius and Porphyry, died in the Persian city of Tabae on his return from Persia to Babylon.</body></html>
