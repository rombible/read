Such was the king, whom Israel had set in the highest place, in whom it had trusted, instead of God.

Aben Ezra thinks the verb "cut off" is to be repeated, Samaria is "cut off, her king is cut off"; both king and kingdom destroyed. So the Targum, <p>"Samaria is cut off with her king:'' <p>as the foam upon the water; as any light thing flowing upon it; as the bark of a tree, as Kimchi and Abarbinel; or as the scum upon a boiling pot of water, as Jarchi, and the Targum; or as foam, which is an assemblage of bubbles upon the water; such are kings and kingdoms, swell, look big and high for a while; but are mere bubbles, empty things; and are often suddenly, quickly, and easily destroyed; so Samaria and her king were by the Assyrian army; the Lord of hosts, the King of kings, being against them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">her king</span>] i. e. not merely the king who happened to be on the throne, but the monarchy itself (as <span class="ital"><a href="/hosea/10-15.htm" title="So shall Bethel do to you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.">Hosea 10:15</a></span>).

Instead of the throne of Samaria being established, or the kingdom consolidated by the idolatrous measures which Jeroboam had adopted for the purpose, the king himself was cut off as foam upon the surface of the waters, or as a chip carried off by the current, and the kingdom ingloriously ruined. Though the sense is sufficiently plain, the sentence has been variously constructed. Thus <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> one of the Hebrew commentators renders it, "In the city of Samaria her king has been made like foam on the surface of the water" (be being understood and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> taken in the sense of "being like"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Rashi, understanding the verb to signify being "reduced to silence," explains, "The King of Samaria is brought to silence." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The correct signification of the verb, however, is "cut off" or "annihilated," while the construction may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> an asyndeton; thus: "Samaria (and) her king;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Samaria taken as nominative absolute,  - thus in the Authorized Version, "(As for) Samaria, her king is cut off;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> supplying <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> to the second noun, with Aben Ezra, "Samaria is cut off, her king is cut off." Some <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> consider it simpler to translate as follows: "Samaria is cut off; her king is like [literally, 'as'] a chip on the surface of the waters." In this way the Massoretic punctuation is neglected. <span class="accented">Sheraton is</span> feminine, as the names of cities and countries usually are, and therefore the suffix to "king" is feminine, while the masculine form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, is justified by its position at the head of the sentence; for, according to Gesenius, the predicate at the beginning of a clause or sentence "often takes its simplest and readiest form, viz. the masculine singular, even when the subject," not yet expressed, but coming after, "is feminine or plural." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span> is explained either as "foam" or "splinter." The latter is, perhaps, preferable, as the verbal root cognate with the Arabic <span class="accented">katsapha</span> signifies "to break," "break off," "crack;" then "to be angry" (its most common meaning) from the sudden breaking out or breaking loose of passion, with which may be compared the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;</span> in <a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>, from the same root, is literally a" breaking or breaking off," "barking," The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span>, again, has two principal meanings - one "to be like," the other "to be silent" (connected, according to Gesenius, with a different root, <span class="accented">darnam, dum, like</span> the English "dumb"); or the meanings are traceable to one root, in the sense of "making flat," "plane," "smooth;" then "silent," and so "reduced to silence," "destroyed." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These verses do not at all present the form of a parenetic reference to the retribution commencing with the resurrection. <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> is by the copula  &#1493;connected with <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, and thereby designates the continuance of the thought of the second half of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, i.e., the further representation of the deliverance of God's people, namely, of all those who are written in the book of life. Since many of the &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; who know their God (<a href="/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33</a>) lose their life in the persecution, so in the promise of deliverance a disclosure of the lot awaiting those who sealed with their blood their fidelity to God was not to be avoided, if the prophecy shall wholly gain its end, i.e., if the promise of the deliverance of all the pious shall afford to the people of God in the times of oppression strength and joy in their enduring fidelity to God. The appeal to the fact that <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a> contain no designation of time proves nothing at all, for this simple reason, that the verses connected by "and" are by this copula placed under <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, which contains a designation of time, and only further show how this deliverance shall ensue, namely thus, that a part of the people shall outlive the tribulation, but those who lose their lives in the persecution shall rise again from the dead.<p>To this is to be added that the contents of <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> do not agree with the period of persecution under Antiochus. That which is said regarding the greatness of the persecution is much too strong for it. The words, "There shall be a time of trouble such as never was &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; , since there was a nation or nations," designate it as such as never was before on the earth. Theodoret interprets thus: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, &#x3b1;&#x3c6; &#787;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. With reference to these words our Lord says: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787;&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4; &#787;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>. Though the oppression which Antiochus brought upon Israel may have been most severe, yet it could not be said of it without exaggeration, that it was such a tribulation as never had been from the beginning of the world. Antiochus, it is true, sought to outroot Judaism root and branch, but Pharaoh also wished to do the same by his command to destroy all the Hebrew male children at their birth; and as Antiochus wished to make the worship of the Grecian Zeus, so also Jezebel the worship of the Phoenician Hercules, in the place of the worship of Jehovah, the national religion in Israel.<p>Still less does the second hemistich of <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> refer to the deliverance of the people from the power of Antiochus. Under the words, "every one that shall be found written in the book," Hitzig remarks that they point back to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>, and that the book is thus the book of life, and corrects the vain interpretation of v. Lengerke, that "to be written in the book" means in an earthly sense to live, to be appointed to life, by the more accurate explanation, "The book of life is thus the record of those who shall live, it is the list of the citizens of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>), and in Isaiah contains the names of those who reach it living, in Daniel also of those who must first be raised from the dead for it." Cf. regarding the book of life, under <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>.<p>Accordingly, &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; extends into the Messianic time. This is so far acknowledged by Hofmann (Weiss. u. Erf. i. p. 313, and Shcriftbew. 2:2, p. 697), in that he finds in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, from "and there shall be a time," and in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>, the prophecy of the final close of the history of nations, the time of the great tribulation at the termination of the present course of the world, the complete salvation of Israel in it, and the resurrection of the dead at the end of the world. Since, however, Hofmann likewise refers the last verses of the preceding chapter to the time of Antiochus and his destruction, and can only refer the &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514; at the beginning of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1-13</a>, from its close connection with the last words of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, to the time which has hitherto been spoken of, so he supposes that in the first clause of the first verse of this chapter (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1-13</a>) there cannot be a passing over to another time, but that this transition is first made by &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;. This transition he seeks indeed, in the 2nd ed. of his Schriftbew. l.c., to cover by the remark: that we may not explain the words of the angel, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, as if they meant: that time shall be a time of trouble such as has not been till now; but much rather that they are to be translated: "and there shall arise a time of trouble such as never was to that time." But this separation of the words in question from those going before by the translation of &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; "and there shall arise," is rendered impossible by the words following, &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1506;&#1514; &#1506;&#1491;; for these so distinctly point back to the words with which the verse commences, that we may not empty them of their definite contents by the ambiguous "till that time." If the angel says, There shall arise a time of oppression such as has never been since there were nations till that time when Michael shall appear for his people, or, as Hofmann translates it, shall "hold fast his place," then to every unprejudiced reader it is clear that this tribulation such as has never been before shall arise not for the first time centuries after the appearance of Michael or of his "holding fast his place," but in the time of the war of the angel-prince for the people of God. In this same time the angel further places the salvation of the people of Daniel and the resurrection of the dead.<p>(Note: Hofmann's explanation of the words would only be valid if the definition of time &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; stood after &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; in the text, which Hofm. in his most recent attempts at its exposition has interpolated inadvertently, while in his earlier exposition (Weiss. u. Erf. i. p. 314) he has openly said: "These last things connect themselves with the prospect of the end of that oppressor of Israel, not otherwise than as when Isaiah spoke of the approaching assault of the Assyrians on Jerusalem as of the last affliction of the city, or as in Jeremiah the end of those seventy years is also the end of all the sufferings of his people. There remains therefore a want of clearness in this prospect," etc. This want of clearness he has, in his most recent exposition in the Schriftbew., not set aside, but increased, by the supposition of an immediate transition from the time of Antiochus to the time of the end.)<p>The failure of all attempts to gain a space of time between <a href="/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> incontrovertibly shows that the assertions of those who dispute the genuineness of the book, that the pseudo-Daniel expected along with the death of Antiochus the commencement of the Messianic kingdom and of the resurrection of the dead, would have a foundation if the last verses of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a> treated of the last undertakings of this Syrian king against the theocracy. This if, it has, however, been seen from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, is not established. In <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40-45</a> the statements do not refer to Antiochus, but to the time of the end, of the last enemy of the holy God, and of his destruction. With that is connected, without any intervening space, in <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a> the description of the last oppression of the people of God and their salvation to everlasting life. The prophecy of that unheard-of great tribulation Christ has in <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a> referred, wholly in the sense of the prophetic announcement, to the yet future &#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; which shall precede the coming of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven to judge the world and to bring to a consummation the kingdom of God. That this tribulation shall come only upon Israel, the people of God, is not said; the &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; refers much more to a tribulation that shall come upon the whole of humanity. In it shall the angel-prince Michael help the people of Daniel, i.e., the people of God. That he shall destroy the hostile king, the Antichrist, is not said. His influence extends only to the assistance which he shall render to the people of God for their salvation, so that all who are written in the book of life shall be saved. Christ, in His eschatological discourse, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, does not make mention of this assistance, but only says that for the elect's sake the days of the oppression shall be shortened, otherwise that no one would be saved (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, <a href="/matthew/24-22.htm">Matthew 24:22</a>). Wherein the help of Michael consists, is seen partly from that which is said in <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a> and <a href="/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> regarding him, that he helped the Angel of the Lord in the war against the hostile spirit of the Persian and the Javanic world-kingdom, partly from the war of Michael against the dragon described in <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>. From these indications it is clear that we may not limit the help on the part of Michael to the help which he renders to the saints of God in the last war and struggle, but that he stands by them in all wars against the world-power and its princes, and helps them to victory.<p>But the salvation which the people of God shall experience in the time of the unparalleled great oppression is essentially different from the help which was imparted to the people of Israel in the time of the Maccabees. This is called "a little help," <a href="/daniel/11-34.htm">Daniel 11:34</a>. So also is the oppression of Israel in the time of the Maccabees different from the oppression in the end of the time, as to its object and consequences. The former oppression shall, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33-35</a>, serve to purify the people and to make them white to the time of the end; the oppression at the time of the end, on the contrary, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1-3</a>, shall effect the salvation (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496;) of the people, i.e., prepare the people for the everlasting life, and bring about the separation of the righteous from the wicked for eternity. These clearly stated distinctions confirm the result already reached, that <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1-3</a> do not treat of the time of Antiochus and the Maccabees.<p>The promised salvation of the people (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496;) is more particularly defined by the addition to &#1506;&#1502;&#1498;: "every one who shall be found written in the book," sc. of life (see above, p. 813); thus every one whom God has ordained to life, all the genuine members of the people of God. &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496;, shall be saved, sc. out of the tribulation, so that they do not perish therein. But since, according to <a href="/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33</a>., in the oppression, which passes over the people of God for their purification, many shall lose their lives, and this also shall be the case in the last and severest oppression, the angel gives to the prophet, in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, disclosures also regarding the dead, namely, that they shall awaken out of the sleep of death. By the connection of this verse with the preceding by ,&#1493; without any further designation of time, the resurrection of the dead is placed as synchronous with the deliverance of the people. "For that the two clauses, 'thy people shall be delivered' (<a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), and 'many shall awake,' not only reciprocally complete each other, but also denote contemporaneous facts, we only deny by first denying that the former declares the final salvation of Israel" (Hofm. Schriftbew. ii. 2, p. 598). &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, sleeping, is here used, as in <a href="/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-39.htm">Jeremiah 51:39</a>, of death; cf. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, <a href="/matthew/9-24.htm">Matthew 9:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:10</a>, and &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>. &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, occurring only here, formed after <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, means not the dust of the earth, but dusty earth, terra pulveris, denoting the grave, as &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>.<p>It appears surprising that &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, many, shall awake, since according to the sequel, where the rising of some to life and of some to shame is spoken of, much rather the word all might have been expected. This difficulty is not removed by the remark that many stands for all, because &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean all. Concerning the opinion that many stands for all, Hofmann remarks, that the expression "sleeping in the dust of earth" is not connected with the word many (&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), but with the verb "shall awake" (&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;): "of them there shall be many, of whom those who sleep in the earth shall arise" (Hofm.). So also C. B. Michaelis interprets the words by reference to the Masoretic accentuation, which has separated &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; (sleeping), only that he takes &#1502;&#1503; in the sense of stating the terminus mutationis a quo. But by this very artificial interpretation nothing at all is gained; for the thought still remains the same, that of those who sleep in the dust many (not all) awake. The partitive interpretation of &#1502;&#1503; is the only simple and natural one, and therefore with most interpreters we prefer it. The &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; can only be rightly interpreted from the context. The angel has it not in view to give a general statement regarding the resurrection of the dead, but only disclosures on this point, that the final salvation of the people shall not be limited to those still living at the end of the great tribulation, but shall include also those who have lost their lives during the period of the tribulation.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-33.htm">Daniel 11:33</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, the angel had already said, that of "those that understand" many shall fall by the sword and by flame, etc. When the tribulation at the time of the end increases to an unparalleled extent (<a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), a yet greater number shall perish, so that when salvation comes, only a remnant of the people shall be then in life. To this surviving remnant of the people salvation is promised; but the promise is limited yet further by the addition: "every one that is found written in the book;" not all that are then living, but only those whose names are recorded in the book of life shall be partakers of the deliverance, i.e., of the Messianic salvation. But many (&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) of those that sleep, who died in the time of tribulation, shall awake out of sleep, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame. As with the living, so also with the dead, not all attain to salvation. Also among those that arise there shall be a distinction, in which the reward of the faithful and of the unfaithful shall be made known. The word "many" is accordingly used only with reference to the small number of those who shall then be living, and not with reference either to the universality of the resurrection of the dead or to a portion only of the dead, but merely to add to the multitude of the dead, who shall then have part with the living, the small number of those who shall experience in the flesh the conclusion of the matter.<p>If we consider this course of thought, then we shall find it necessary neither to obtrude upon &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; the meaning of all, - a meaning which it has not and cannot have, for the universality of the resurrection is removed by the particle &#1502;&#1503;, which makes it impossible that  ,&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  equals  &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;; for this conclusion can only be drawn from the misapprehension of the course of thought here presented, that this verse contains a general statement of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, an idea which is foreign to the connection.<p>From the correct interpretation of the course of thought arises the correct answer to the controverted question, whether here we are taught concerning the resurrection of the people of Israel, or concerning the resurrection of mankind generally. Neither the one nor the other of these things is taught here. The prophetic words treat of the people of Daniel, by which we are to understand the people of Israel. But the Israel of the time of the end consists not merely of Jews or of Jewish Christians, but embraces all peoples who belong to God's kingdom of the New Covenant founded by Christ. In this respect the resurrection of all is here implicite intimated, and Christ has explicitly set forth the thoughts lying implicite in this verse; for in <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28</a>. He teaches the awakening from sleep of all the dead, and speaks, with unmistakeable reference to this passage before us, of an &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; and an &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;. For in the O.T. our verse is the only passage in which, along with the resurrection to everlasting life, there is mention also made of the resurrection to everlasting shame, or the resurrection of the righteous and of the wicked. The conception of &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;  ,&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, meets us here for the first time in the O.T. &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; denotes, it is true, frequently the true life with God, the blessed life in communion with God, which exists after this life; but the addition &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; does not generally occur, and is here introduced to denote, as corresponding to the eternal duration of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>, cf. <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>), the life of the righteous in this kingdom as imperishable. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; forms the contrast to &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;; for first &#1495;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;, shame (a plur. of intensive fulness), is placed over against the &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;, then this shame is designated in reference to <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a> as &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, contempt, an object of aversion.</body></html>
