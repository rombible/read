There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves.

They changed, whenever they did change, with a feigned, hypocritical conversion, but not to God, nor acknowledging His Majesty. Man, until truly converted, turns to and fro, unstably, hither and thither, changing from one evil to another, from the sins of youth to the sins of age, from the sins of prosperity to the sin of adversity; but he remains himself unchanged. He "turns, not to the most High." The prophet says this in three, as it were, broken words, "They turn,  not most High." The hearer readily filled up the broken sentence, which fell, drop by drop, from the prophet's choked heart.<p>They are like a deceitful bow - Which, "howsoever the archer directs it, will not carry the arrow right home to the mark," but to other objects clean contrary to his will. : "God had, as it were, bent Israel, as His own bow, against the tyranny of the devil and the deceit of idolatry. For Israel alone in the whole world cast aside the worship of idols, and was attached to the true and natural Lord of all things. But they turned themselves to the contrary. For, being bound to this, they fought against God for the glory of idols. They became then as a warped bow, shooting their arrows contrariwise." In like way doth every sinner act, using against God, in the service of Satan, God's gifts of nature or of outward means, talents, or wealth, or strength, or beauty, or power of speech. God gave all for His own glory; and man turns all aside to do honor and service to Satan.<p>Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue - The word, rendered  "rage," is everywhere else used of the wrath of God; here, of the "wrath" and "foaming" of man against God. Jeremiah relates how, the nearer their destruction came upon Judah, the more madly the politicians and false prophets cantradicted what God revealed. Their tongue was a "sharp sword." They sharpened their tongue like a sword; and the sword pierced their own bosom. The phrensy of their speech not only drew down God's anger, but was the instrument of their destruction. They misled the people; taught them to trust in Egypt, not in God; persuaded them to believe themselves, and to disbelieve God; to believe, that the enemy should depart from them and not carry them away captive. They worked up the people to their will, and so they secured their own destruction. The princes of Judah were especially judged and put to death by Nebuchadnezzar <a href="/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10</a>. The like probably took place in Israel. In any case, those chief in power are chief objects of destruction. Still more did these words come true before the final destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. They were maddened by their own curse, "the rage of their tongue" against their Redeemer, "His blood be on us and on our children." Frenzy became their characteristic. It was the amazement of the Romans, and their own destruction.<p>This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt - This, i. e., all this, their boasting of Egypt, their failure, their destruction, shall become their "derision." In Egypt had they trusted; to Egypt had they gone for succor; in Egypt should they be derided. Such is the way of man. The world derides those who trusted in it, sued it, courted it, served it, preferred it to their God. Such are the wages, which it gives. So Isaiah prophesied of Judah, "the strength of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame and also a reproach" <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. return, but not to the Most High&#8212;or, "to one who is not the Most High," one very different from Him, a stock or a stone.

Their God-defying attitude, as described in ver. 15, is represented in ver. 16 allegorically as a deceitful bow, which fails to scud the arrow to the mark; also their unsuccess is represented as exposing them to the derision of Egypt; while the princes who spake so exceeding proudly, and who instigated their ungodliness and consequent wretchedness, would be slain with the sword.

Appearing to return to the worship of Jehovah, they turned aside to an idol.

Hv., v. Leng., Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, and Klief. translate '&#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;: he shall during (some) years stand off from the king of the north. Literally this translation may perhaps be justified, for &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, c. &#1502;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>, has the meaning of "to leave off," and the expression "to stand off from war" may be used concisely for "to desist from making war" upon one. But this interpretation does not accord with the connection. First, it is opposed by the expressive &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, which cannot be understood, if nothing further should be said than that the king of the south, after he had overthrown the fortresses of the enemies' country, and had carried away their gods and their treasures, abstained from war for some years. The &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; much rather leads us to this, that the passage introduced by it states some new important matter which does not of itself appear from the subjugation of the enemy and his kingdom. To this is to be added, that the contents of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9</a>, where the subject to &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; can only be the king of the north, do not accord with the abstaining of the king of the south from warring against the king of the north. By Ewald's remark, "With such miserable marchings to and fro they mutually weaken themselves," the matter is not made intelligible. For the penetrating of the king of the south into the fortresses of his enemy, and the carrying away of his gods and his treasures, was not a miserable, useless expedition; but then we do not understand how the completely humbled king of the north, after his conqueror abstained from war, was in the condition to penetrate into his kingdom and then to return to his own land. Would his conqueror have suffered him to do this? We must, therefore, with Kranichfeld, Gesenius, de Wette, and Winer, after the example of the Syriac and Vulgate, take &#1502;&#1503; &#1497;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; in the sense of: to stand out before, &#1502;&#1503; in the sense of &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, contra, as in <a href="/psalms/43-1.htm">Psalm 43:1</a> it is construed with &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, which is supported by the circumstance that &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-6.htm">Daniel 11:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-15.htm">Daniel 11:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-17.htm">Daniel 11:17</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a>, has this meaning. By this not only is &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; rightly translated: and he, the same who penetrated into the fortresses of his adversary and carried away his gods, shall also take his stand against him, assert his supremacy for years; but also <a href="/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9</a> contains a suitable addition, for it shows how he kept his ground. The king of the north shall after some time invade the kingdom of the king of the south, but shall return to his own land, namely, because he can effect nothing. Kran. takes the king of the south as the subject to &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, <a href="/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9</a>; but this is impossible, for then the word must be &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;, particularly in parallelism with &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;&#1493;. As the words stand, &#1492;&#1504;&#1490;&#1489; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, can only be the genitive to &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;; thus the supposition that "the king of the south is the subject" is excluded, because the expression, "the king of the south comes into the kingdom of the south and returns to his own land," has no meaning when, according to the context, the south denotes Egypt. With the &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; there also begins a change of the subject, which, though it appears contrary to the idiom of the German [and English] language, is frequently found in Hebrew; e.g., in <a href="/daniel/11-11.htm">Daniel 11:11</a> and <a href="/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9</a>. By the mention of an expedition of the king of the north into the kingdom of the king of the south, from which he again returned without having effected anything, the way is opened for passing to the following description of the supremacy of the king of the north over the king of the south. </body></html>
