There were tokens of approaching ruin, as grey hairs are of old age, but they noticed them not. The pride which leads to break the law of God leads to self-flattery. The mercy and grace of God are the only refuge to which obstinate sinners never think of fleeing. Though they may howl forth their terrors in the form of prayers, they seldom cry to God with their hearts. Even their prayers for earthly mercies only seek fuel for their lusts. Their turning from one sect, sentiment, form, or vice, to another, still leaves them far short of Christ and holiness. Such are we by nature. And such shall we prove if left to ourselves.

He thought his losses at the hand of the enemy, passing wounds, which time would heal; he thought not of them, as tokens of God's separation from him, that his time of trial was coming to its close, his strength decaying, his end at hand. Israel was not only incorrigible, but "past feeling" <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>, as the Apostle says of the pagan. The marks of wasting and decay were visible to sight and touch; yet he himself perceived not what all saw except himself. Israel had sought to strangers for help, and it "had turned to his decay." Pul and Tiglath-pileser had "devoured his strength," despoiling him of his wealth and treasure, the flower of his men, and the produce of his land, draining him of his riches, and hardly oppressing him through the tribute imposed upon him. But "like men quite stupified, they, though thus continually gnawed upon, yet suffered themselves willingly to be devoured, and seemed insensible of it." Yet not only so, but the present evils were the forerunners of worse. Grey hairs, themselves the effects of declining age and tokens of decay, are the forerunners of death. "Thy grey hairs are thy passing-bell," says the proverb .<p>The prophet repeats, after each clause, "he knoweth not." He knoweth nothing; be knoweth not the tokens of decay in himself, but hides them from himself; he knoweth not God, who is the author of them;. he knoweth not the cause of them, his sins; he knoweth not the end and object of them, his conversion; he knoweth not, what, since he knoweth not any of these things, will be the issue of them, his destruction. People hide from themselves the tokens of decay, whether of body or soul. And so death, whether of body or soul or both, comes upon them unawares. : "Looking on the surface, he imagines that all things are right with him, not feeling the secret worm which gnaws within. The outward garb remains; the rules of fasting are observed; the stated times of prayer are kept; but the heart is far from Me, saith the Lord. Consider diligently what thou lovest, what thou fearest, whereat thou rejoicest or art saddened, and thou will find, under the habit of religion, a worldly mind; under the rags of conversion, a heart of perversion." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The symptoms of the declining state of the church of God are at this time upon us, and yet not taken notice of; such as great departures from the faith; a number of false teachers risen up; great failings off of professors, and of such who have made a great figure in the church; a small number of faithful men; great coldness and lukewarmness to spiritual things; little faith on the earth; great neglect of Gospel worship and ordinances; much sleepiness and drowsiness; great immorality and profaneness: as also the symptoms of the declining state of the world, and of its drawing to its period; as wars, and rumours of wars, famine, pestilence, and earthquakes in divers places; volcanos, burning mountains, eruptions of subterraneous fire, which portend the general conflagration; and yet these things are little attended to. <p>(s)   "canities sparsit se in eo", Pagninus, Montanus, Cocceius, Schmidt; "cani sparsi sunt", Tigurine version; "canities aspergit eum", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; so Latin writers: "sparserit et nigras alba senecta comas".

As the Greeks called all who did not speak the Greek language, whether they were savage or civilized, barbarians, so Israel called all foreigners, whether near or far off, strangers. The foreign nations here meant were those with which Israel had entered into treaties or formed alliances, in contravention of the constitution which God had given them. These nations, moreover, devoured their national resources by the imposition of taxes and hostile incursions; thus the King of Syria left "of the people to Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the King of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing;" again, when "Pul, the King of Assyria, came against the laud," we read that Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the King of Assyria;" then, "in the days of Pekah King of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazer, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. "The <span class="accented">strength</span> here mentioned includes all those things which constitute the wealth and well-being of a country, the produce of the soil and the riches of its inhabitants. Thus Aben Ezra rightly explains this clause, referring it to "the tribute which the Israelites gave to Assyria and Egypt, as is written in the Book of Kings." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, grey hairs are here and there</span> (margin, <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>upon him</span>. What from foreign foes and internal feuds, the body politic was manifesting unmistakable symptoms of decay and decrepitude and approaching dissolution, just as grey hairs on the human body give indication of the advance of old age, with its decay of strength and nearness to the tomb. "The course of nature," says Aben Ezra, "has sprinkled grey hairs upon him, just as grey hair comes on men in consequence of the course of nature;" this corresponds to the sentiment of the preceding clause, for, according to the commentator just named," the grey hair denotes that their power is weakened and their possession perished." <span class="cmt_word">Yet he knoweth not is parallel to</span>. "And he knoweth (it) not," and repeats the same sentiment, of course with emphasis of what was Israel thus ignorant? Not, surely, of the declining state of the national strength and the decay of the national importance. After so many drains upon their resources and the unsatisfactory position of their foreign relations, they could not shut their eyes upon the steadily and even rapidly approaching decadence. But though they could not pretend ignorance of the fact, they remained in ignorance of the cause, its consequence, and the cure. Notwithstanding the already exhausted condition of their country, and the process of exhaustion still going on, they overlooked the lamentable cause of all, which was their sin, national and individual, in departing from the Lord; and at the same time the dangerous consequences that were neither remote nor capable of being staved off; as also the only possible cure to be found in direct and immediate return and application to that God from whom they had so revolted. The "it" supplied in the Authorized Version <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> had better be omitted; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the construction adopted by Rashi and others, who make the first part of each clause the object of the second, is erroneous, as we have shown in the preceding observations. "They took it not to heart that the kings of Syria consumed them in the days of Jehoahaz" is the exposition of Rashi just referred to; but that of Kimchi favors the first and correct construction, as may be inferred from the words, "And he (Israel) knows not that on account of his iniquity all this has come upon him, and yet he turns not from his wickedness." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The events of the nearest future - <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2-20</a><p>The revelation passes quickly from Persia (<a href="/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2</a>) and the kingdom of Alexander (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a>, <a href="/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a>), to the description of the wars of the kingdoms of the south and the north, arising out of the latter, in which wars the Holy Land, lying between the two, was implicated. Regarding Persia it is only said that yet three kings shall arise, and that the fourth, having reached to great power by his riches, shall stir up all against the kingdom of Javan. Since this prophecy originates in the third year of the Persian king Cyrus (<a href="/daniel/10-1.htm">Daniel 10:1</a>), then the three kings who shall yet (&#1506;&#1493;&#1491;) arise are the three successors of Cyrus, viz., Cambyses, the pseudo-Smerdis, and Darius Hystaspes; the fourth is then Xerxes, with whom all that is said regarding the fourth perfectly agrees. Thus Hvernick, Ebrard, Delitzsch, Auberlen, and Kliefoth interpret; on the contrary, v. Lengerke, Maurer, Hitzig, and Kranichfeld will make the fourth the third, so as thereby to justify the erroneous interpretation of the four wings and the four heads of the leopard (<a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a>) of the first four kings of the Persian monarchy, because, as they say, the article in &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497; necessarily requires that the fourth is already mentioned in the immediately preceding statements. But the validity of this conclusion is not to be conceived; and the assertion that the O.T. knows only of four kings of Persia (Hitzig) cannot be established from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-5.htm">Ezra 4:5-7</a>, nor from any other passage. From the naming of only four kings of Persia in the book of Ezra, since from the end of the Exile to Ezra and Nehemiah four kings had reigned, it in no way follows that the book of Daniel and the O.T. generally know of only four. Moreover, this assertion is not at all correct; for in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22</a>, besides those four there is mention made also of a Darius, and to the Jews in the age of the Maccabees there was well known, according to 1 Macc. 1:1, also the name of the last Persian king, Darius, who was put to death by Alexander. If the last named, the king who by great riches (<a href="/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2</a>) reached to a higher power, is included among the three previously named, then he should have been here designated "the third." The verb &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, to place oneself, then to stand, is used here and frequently in the following passages, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>, in the sense of to stand up ( equals  &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), with reference to the coming of a new ruler. The gathering together of greater riches than all (his predecessors), agrees specially with Xerxes; cf. Herodot. iii. 96, vi. 27-29, and Justini Histor. ii. 2. The latter says of him: "Divitias, non ducem laudes, quarum tanta copia in regno ejus fuit, ut, cum flumina multitudine consumerentur, opes tamen regiae superessent."<p>&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1514;&#1493; is the infinit. or nomen actionis, the becoming strong; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a> with <a href="/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a> and <a href="/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493; is not in apposition to it, "according to his riches" (Hv.); but it gives the means by which he became strong. "Xerxes expended his treasures for the raising and arming of an immense host, so as by such &#1495;&#1494;&#1511; (cf. <a href="/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>) to conquer Greece" (Hitzig). &#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1514; is not in apposition to &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, all, namely, the kingdom of Javan (Maurer, Kranichfeld). This does not furnish a suitable sense; for the thought that &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, "they all," designates the divided states of Greece, and the apposition, "the kingdom of Javan," denotes that they were brought by the war with Xerxes to form themselves into the unity of the Macedonian kingdom, could not possibly be so expressed. Moreover, the reference to the circumstances of the Grecian states is quite foreign to the context. &#1502; &#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1514; is much rather a second, more remote object, and &#1488;&#1514; is to be interpreted, with Hvernick, either as the preposition with, so far as &#1497;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; involves the idea of war, conflict, or simply, with Hitzig, as the accusative of the object of the movement (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/9-29.htm">Exodus 9:29</a>, <a href="/exodus/9-33.htm">Exodus 9:33</a>), to stir up, to rouse, after the kingdom of Javan, properly to make, to cause, that all (&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  every one, cf. <a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>) set out towards. Daniel calls Greece &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, after the analogy of the Oriental states, as a united historical power, without respect to the political constitution of the Grecian states, not suitable to prophecy (Kliefoth).<p>From the conflict of Persia with Greece, the angel (<a href="/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3</a>) passes immediately over to the founder of the Grecian (Macedonian) world-kingdom; for the prophecy proceeds not to the prediction of historical details, but mentions only the elements and factors which constitute the historical development. The expedition of Xerxes against Greece brings to the foreground the world-historical conflict between Persia and Greece, which led to the destruction of the Persian kingdom by Alexander the Great. The reply of Alexander to Darius Codomannus (Arrian, Exped Alex. ii. 14. 4) supplies a historical document, in which Alexander justifies his expedition against Persia by saying that Macedonia and the rest of Hellas were assailed in war by the Persians without any cause (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;), and that therefore he had resolved to punish the Persians. A deeper reason for this lies in this, that the prophecy closes the list of Persian kings with Xerxes, but not in this, that under Xerxes the Persian monarchy reached its climax, and partly already under him, and yet more after his reign, the fall of the kingdom had begun (Hvernick, Auberlen); still less in the opinion, proved to be erroneous, that the Maccabean Jew knew no other Persian kings, and confounded Xerxes with Darius Codomannus (v. Lengerke, Maurer, Hitzig). </body></html>
