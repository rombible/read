Their sins appear on every side of them. Their hearts were inflamed by evil desires, like a heated oven. In the midst of their troubles as a nation, the people never thought of seeking help from God. The actual wickedness of men's lives bears a very small proportion to what is in their hearts. But when lust is inwardly cherished, it will break forth into outward sin. Those who tempt others to drunkenness never can be their real friends, and often design their ruin. Thus men execute the Divine vengeance on each other. Those are not only heated with sin, but hardened in sin, who continue to live without prayer, even when in trouble and distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are all adulterers - The prophet continues to picture the corruption of all kinds and degrees of people. "All of them," king, princes, people; all were given to adultery, both spiritual, in departing from God, and actual, (for both sorts of sins went together,) in defiling themselves and others. "All of them" were, (so the word  means,) habitual "adulterers." One only pause there was in their sin, the preparation to complete it. He likens their hearts, inflamed with lawless lusts, to the heat of "an oven" which "the baker" had already "heated." The unusual construction "burning from the baker"  instead of "heated "by" the baker" may have been chosen, in order to express, how the fire continued to burn of itself, as it were, (although at first kindled by the baker,) and was ever-ready to burn whatever was brought to it, and even now was all red-hot, burning on continually; and Satan, who had stirred it, gave it just this respite, "from the time when he had kneaded the dough" , until the leaven, which he had put into it, had fully worked, and the whole was ready for the operation of the fire.<p>The world is full of such people now, ever on fire, and pausing only from sin, until the flatteries, whereby they seduce the unstable, have worked and penetrated the whole mind, and victim after victim is gradually leavened and prepared for sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. who ceaseth from raising&#8212;rather, "heating" it, from an Arabic root, "to be hot." So the Septuagint. Their adulterous and idolatrous lust is inflamed as the oven of a baker who has it at such a heat that he ceaseth from heating it only from the time that he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened; he only needs to omit feeding it during the short period of the fermentation of the bread. Compare 2Pe 2:14, "that cannot cease from sin" [Henderson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hosea/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They are all adulterers, </span> both spiritually and carnally, and this latter adultery is that which here is charged on the courtiers and people of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As an oven heated by the baker:</span> this vice is grown raging hot among them, as you see the fire in an oven, when the baker, having called up those that make the bread, to prepare all things ready, and the whole mass is leavened, he doth by continued supply of fuel heat the oven to the highest degree.

The whole mass of the people are leavened with this vice also, as well as the court, and every one inflamed with this unclean fire, as the oven heated by the baker. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hosea/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They are all adulterers,.... King, princes, priests, and people, both in a spiritual and corporeal sense; they were all idolaters, given to idols try, eager of it, and constant in it, as the following metaphors show; and they were addicted to corporeal adultery; this was a prevailing vice among all ranks and degrees of men. So the Targum, <p>"they all desire to lie with their neighbours' wives;'' <p>see <a href="/jeremiah/5-7.htm">Jeremiah 5:7</a>; <p>as an oven heated by the baker; which, if understood of spiritual adultery or idolatry, denotes their eagerness after it, and fervour in it, excited by their king, or by the devil and his instruments, the priests and false prophets; and if of bodily uncleanness, it is expressive of the heat of that lust, which is sometimes signified by burning; and is stirred up by the devil and the corrupt hearts of men to such a degree as to be raised to a flame, and be like a raging fire, or a heated oven; see <a href="/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>; <p>who ceaseth from raising; that is, the baker, having heated his oven, ceaseth from raising up the women to bring their bread to the bake house; or he ceaseth from waking, or from watching his oven; he lays himself down to sleep, and continues in it: <p>after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened; having kneaded the dough, and put in the leaven, he lets it alone to work till the whole mass is leavened, taking his rest in the mean while: as the former clause expresses the vehement desire of the people after adultery, spiritual or corporeal, this may signify their continuance in it; or rather the wilful negligence of the king, priests, and prophets, who, instead of awaking them out of their sleep on a bed of adultery, let them alone in it, until they were all infected with it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They <i>are</i> all adulterers, as an <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> oven heated by the baker, <i>who</i> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</span><p>(c) He compares the rage of the people to a burning oven which the baker heats, until his dough is leavened and raised.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">as an oven</span> …] The fire corresponds to sensual lust, the oven is the heart.

There is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that already given, and which is in some measure supported by the following rabbinic comments: "Their evil passion," says Rashi, "which stirs them up, rests from kneading the dough until it is leavened, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from the time that any one has thought on evil in his heart how he shall execute it, he rests and sleeps till the morning, when he shall be able to execute it, as the baker rests from kneading the dough until it is leavened, when he can bake it." Similar and yet somewhat peculiar is the concluding portion of Kimchi's comment: "As soon as he lays the pieces of wood into the oven, in order to heat it, he commands the women to knead, and he ceases to stir them (the women) up until the dough is leavened, as he estimates it in his heart, and then he rouses them to come with the dough to bake it. And this is the time when the oven is heated." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> as a noun prefixed with the preposition <span class="accented">rain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and translates the whole as follows: "They are all adulterers, as an oven glowing from flame for hot-baking, from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened." The interpretation <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of Wunsche differs considerably from both the preceding; it is, "They are all adulterers, like an even, burning from a baker, who <span class="accented">rests while stoking</span> from the kneading of the dough till its fermentation;" and he cites in favor of this view Aben Ezra as follows: "This verse is inverted, and accordingly the sense is: As the oven of a baker burneth from the kneading of the dough till its fermentation, so that the baker can scarcely cease to stir it up, but must stir it up and heat it violently." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Therefore he may not talk with this Lord, i.e., with Him who appeared before him in such dread majesty; and he is yet in such a state, since all strength has departed from him and his breath has gone, that he fears he must die; cf. <a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17</a>.
