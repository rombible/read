Or they may be considered as addressed to Israel, and then the meaning of them must be, The punishment which shall come upon thee, O Israel, will clearly appear to be perfectly just; nor shall any thing happen to thee, but what thou hast been fully and repeatedly warned of. Bishop Horsley, however, connecting these words with the following, gives them a different sense. Taking the word <span class="greekheb">משׁפשׂיךְ</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">thy judgments, </span>to signify <span class="ital">thy precepts, </span>he renders the clause, <span class="ital">And the precepts given thee </span>(namely, given to the people) <span class="ital">were as the onward-going light, </span>&c., “that is, as light, of which it is the nature and property to go forth, to propagate itself infinitely, and in all directions; a most expressive image of the clearness of the practical lessons of the prophets.” The word, adds he, in his <span class="ital">Critical Notes, </span>“signifies a fixed principle, or rule, in any thing, to which principle and rule can be applied. Here I take it for the practical rules of a moral and godly life, as delivered by the prophets; and so Calvin expounds it: ‘<span class="ital">Judicia tua, </span>hoc est, ratio piè vivendi,’ Thy judgments, that is, the method of living piously.

Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments. May the Lord put his fear into our hearts, and set up his kingdom within us, and never leave us to ourselves, nor suffer us to be overcome by temptation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets - Since they despised God's gentler warnings and measures, He used severer. "He hewed" them, He says, as men hew stones out of the quarry, and with hard blows and sharp instruments overcome the hardness of the stone which they have to work. Their piety and goodness were light and unsubstantial as a summer cloud; their stony hearts were harder than the material stone. The stone takes the shape which man would give it; God hews man in vain; he will not receive the image of God, for which and in which he was framed.<p>God, elsewhere also, likens the force and vehemence of His word to "a hammer which breaketh the rocks in pieces" <a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>; "a sword which pierceth even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit" <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>. : He "continually hammered, beat upon, disquieted them, and so vexed them (as they thought) even unto death, not allowing them to rest in their sins, not suffering them to enjoy themselves in them, but forcing them (as it were) to part with things which they loved as their lives, and would as soon part with their souls as with them."<p>And thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth - The "judgments" here are the acts of justice executed upon a man; the "judgment upon him," as we say. God had done all which could be done, to lay aside the severity of His own judgments. All had failed. Then His judgments, when they came, would be manifestly just; their justice clear "as the light which goeth forth" out of the darkness of night, or out of the thick clouds. God's past loving-kindness, His pains, (so to speak,) His solicitations, the drawings of His grace, the tender mercies of His austere chastisements, will, in the Day of Judgment, stand out clear as the light, and leave the sinner confounded, without excuse. In this life, also, God's final "judgments are as a light which goeth forth," enlightening, not the sinner who perishes, but others, heretofore in the darkness of ignorance, on whom they burst with a sudden blaze of light, and who reverence them, owning that "the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether" <a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>.<p>And so, since they would not be reformed, what should have been for their wealth, was for their destruction. "I slew them by the words of My mouth." God spake yet more terribly to them. He slew them in word, that He might not slay them in deed; He threatened them with death; since they repented not, it came. The stone, which will not take the form which should have been imparted to it, is destroyed by the strokes which should have moulded it. By a like image Jeremiah compared the Jews to ore which is consumed in the fire which should refine it; since there was no good in it. "They are brass and iron; they are all corrupted; the bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. I hewed them by the prophets&#8212;that is, I announced by the prophets that they should be hewn asunder, like trees of the forest. God identifies His act with that of His prophets; the word being His instrument for executing His will (Jer 1:10; Eze 43:3).<p>by &#8230; words of my mouth&#8212;(Isa 11:4; Jer 23:29; Heb 4:12).<p>thy judgments&#8212;the judgments which I will inflict on thee, Ephraim and Judah (Ho 6:4). So "thy judgments," that is, those inflicted on thee (Zep 3:15).<p>are as the light, &c.&#8212;like the light, palpable to the eyes of all, as coming from God, the punisher of sin.

Your hearts have been like knotty trees, or hardest stones: I have made my prophets like labourers, and, my words like axes or hammers to cut off the knots, and to hew off the roughness which make unfit for use; but all to no purpose, the desired effect hath not been attained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By the prophets; </span> some that were before Hosea. Jeroboam the First was by a prophet reproved and threatened for this idolatry, in which Israel persisted, and to which Judah did too often fall; and through the space of two hundred years, from Jeroboam the First to Hosea’s time, many other prophets were sent, whose names, and some memoirs of them, we have, as Ahijah, Jehu, Hanani, Elijah, and Elisha. These and such like were the prophets that did hew crooked and knotty Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have slain them:</span> some say the false prophets are the persons meant here, whom God did slay for their sin, seducing Israel to, and confirming them in, idolatry; indeed Elijah’s sincere zeal did cut off so many, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/18-22.htm" title="Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.">1 Kings 18:22</a>,40</span>, and Jehu’s counterfeit zeal cut off so many, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/10-21.htm" title="And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not.

So the thing is true, many false prophets were slain for this sin; yet the persons in our text were not these false prophets, but they were the people of Israel and Judah, the idolatrous, refractory hypocrites among them, whom God threatened with death, and that by the sword of enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By the words of my mouth; </span> as he did by his word foretell, so he did effect too in due time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth, </span> i.e. the punishments threatened, the miseries foretold, which fell upon this people, did so fully answer the prediction, that every one might see them clear as the light, and as constantly executed as the morning.

Sharply reproved them for their sins by the prophets, who were as lapidaries that cut stone, or us hewers of timber that cut off the knotty parts; so these by preaching the terrors of the law, which is a killing letter, and by delivering out the threatenings of the Lord, and denouncing his judgments upon them for their sins, cut them to the heart, and killed them; for their foretelling and prophesying of their being slain, ruined, and destroyed, was a slaying of them; see <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>. The Targum is, <p>"because I admonished them by the message of my prophets, and they returned not, I will bring upon them those that slay, because they have transgressed the word of my will.'' <p>But the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, and so Aben Ezra and Joseph Kimchi, understand these words, not of hewing, and cutting, and slaying of the people by the prophets, but of the cutting and slaying the prophets themselves, and read the words, "therefore have I cut off the prophets, and slain them &amp;c.", either the false prophets, some of them that caused the people to err, that they might not repent, as Aben Ezra; as the prophets of Baal in the times of Elijah, and the Scribes and Pharisees in Christ's time, who were in the way of the people's repentance, reformation, and reception of Christ; these he cut off, and their doctrine, and condemned by his own, and the doctrine of his apostles, the words of the Lord's mouth; see <a href="/zechariah/11-8.htm">Zechariah 11:8</a>; and this he did for the good of his people, in answer to the question put by himself in <a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>; so Schmidt interprets it: or else the true prophets of God, who were exposed to death, to be cut off and slain, for the messages they were sent with: or those messages were such as were killing to them to carry them, and deliver them; and they were so constantly employed, early and late, in such service, that for the work of the Lord they were often nigh unto death: but our version, and the sense agreeable to it, scent best; <p>and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth; that is, their judgments, the people's, a sudden change of person: meaning either the statutes and judgments prescribed them by the Lord, and to be observed by them; which were clear and plain as the light at noon day, and therefore could not plead any excuse of ignorance of them, that they did not observe them: or the judgments of God upon them for their sins; which were open and manifest to all, and increasing like the light, more and more, and no more to be resisted than that; and the righteousness of God in them was very conspicuous; his judgments were manifest, and the justice of them. Some understand this of the judgments or righteousnesses of the saints, both imputed and inherent, <a href="/romans/5-16.htm">Romans 5:16</a>; which appear light and clear, the darkness of pharisaism being removed by Christ.

The divine or prophetic word has a destroying power ascribed to it (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm" title="And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;">Isaiah 49:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm" title="See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.">1 Kings 19:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth</span>] ‘Thy judgments,’ i.e. those pronounced upon thee. According to this reading we have to supply ‘as,’ and suppose a sudden change of pronoun. The Septuagint, however, with the Peshito, and even the Targum, reads differently—<span class="bld">my judgment shall go forth as the light</span> (this simply involves a slightly different grouping of the letters). ‘My judgment’, viz. that upon Israel; ‘shall go forth’, for we are no longer in the imagined future (as in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/hosea/6-1.htm" title="Come, and let us return to the LORD: for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up....">Hosea 6:1-3</a></span>); ‘as the light’, that all may see it and tremble.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - The consequence of Israel's unsteadiness and inconstancy is here stated. Because of the fluctuating and formal nature of their religiousness, God cut them down (instead of rearing them up) through his prophets by fierce denunciations, and slew them (instead of reviving them) by the Divine word. The judgment of Jehovah went forth as the lightning-fish, or was as clear and conspicuous for justice as the light of day. Neither could outward services expiate their sins, when the proper feelings and meet fruits were absent. <span class="cmt_word">I have hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth.</span> The language is figurative - the first clause seems borrowed from hewing hard wood and shaping it so as to assume the required form; so God dealt with Israel to bring them into shape morally symmetrical, and make them correspond to the character of a holy people. The slaying is metaphorical, and consisted in the denunciation of death and destruction to the impenitent; in this way he killed, but did not make alive. A different rendering of the clause is given by the LXX. and also by Aben Ezra; the former has, "Therefore have I mown down your prophets; I have slain them with the word of my mouth;" the latter has, "The sense is that he slew some of the prophets who misled the people so that they did not turn (repent)." But <span class="accented">be</span> does not imply his hewing in among the prophets; it is instrumental. <span class="cmt_word">And thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</span> The judgments here spoken of are the Divine judgments denounced against, or inflicted on, the people. Another reading has the pronominal suffix of the first person: "My judgment goeth forth as the light;" to which the Septuagint corresponds: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "my judgment." <span class="accented">I desired mercy</span> (or, <span class="accented">mercy I delight in</span>)...  <span class="accented">and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings</span>. The former is the right state of the life, the latter the correct condition of the heart; the former manifests itself in practice, the latter embraces the proper feelings and affections; the former is seen in works of charity and benevolence, the latter consists in right motives and the right relation of the soul to God. The Hebrew form of speech here used denotes inferior importance, not the negation of importance. A similar sentiment occurs in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." Parallel statements are found in <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7-9</a> and Psalm 50:8; also in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. Our Lord cites the first clause of ver. 6 twice - once against Pharisaic ceremonialism (<a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>), and again against rigorous sabbatarianism (<a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>); while there is an allusion to it in <a href="/mark/12-33.htm">Mark 12:33</a>, where love to God and to one's neighbor is declared to be better, or "more than, whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." Sacrifices in themselves, and when offered at the proper time and place, and as the expressions of penitent hearts and pure hands, were acceptable, and could not be otherwise, for God himself had appointed them. But soulless sacrifices offered by men steeped in sin were an abomination to the Lord; it was of such he said, "I cannot away with" them. It is to such that the prophet refers here, as is plain from the following verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel here calls the appearance great with reference to the majesty displayed, such as had never hitherto been known to him.
