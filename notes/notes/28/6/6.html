The Jews use to express comparison by negatives, or rejecting the thing less worthy: so we are to understand that expression of the Prophet <a href="/joel/2-13.htm" title="And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn to the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil.">Joel 2:13</a>, <span class="ital">Rend your heart, and not your garments; </span>and those words of Christ, <a href="/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>, <span class="ital">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth to everlasting life: </span>that is, for this rather than the former. By <span class="ital">mercy </span>is here meant, not only all that is due from man to man, considered as fellow-creatures, and members of civil society; but also those acts of benevolence, which, though not claimable on principles of justice, yet must be performed by us, as we have opportunity, if we would be the <span class="ital">children of our Father who is in heaven: </span>see <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm" title="That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.">Matthew 5:45</a>. Indeed, the word <span class="greekheb">חסד</span>, here used, and rendered <span class="ital">mercy, </span>includes piety toward God, as well as benevolence to man; or the performance of all the duties of the moral law. “I can find no single word,” says Bishop Horsley, “to answer to it, but <span class="ital">charity; </span>for charity, in the evangelical sense, is the love of man, founded upon the love of God, and arising out of it.” <span class="ital">And the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings — </span>Namely, that knowledge of God, which is his super natural gift, through the influence of his enlightening Spirit, <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; and which is always productive of a filial confidence in him, love to him, and obedience to his commandments; (see <a href="/psalms/9-10.htm" title="And they that know your name will put their trust in you: for you, LORD, have not forsaken them that seek you.">Psalm 9:10</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments....">1 John 2:3-4</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God....">1 John 4:7-8</a>;) and which is always attended with a true, sincere, internal, spiritual worship of him, and reverence for him.

Therefore the Lord sent awful messages by the prophets. The word of God will be the death either of the sin or of the sinner. God desired mercy rather than sacrifice, and that knowledge of him which produces holy fear and love. This exposes the folly of those who trust in outward observances, to make up for their want of love to God and man. As Adam broke the covenant of God in paradise, so Israel had broken his national covenant, notwithstanding all the favours they received. Judah also was ripe for Divine judgments. May the Lord put his fear into our hearts, and set up his kingdom within us, and never leave us to ourselves, nor suffer us to be overcome by temptation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I hate, I despise your solemn feast days,<p>And I will not smell in your solemn assemblies;<p>Though ye offer me your burnt-offerings,<p>And your meat-offerings<p>I will not accept them;<p>Neither will I regard the thank-offerings of your fat beasts.<p>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs;<p>For I will not hear the melody of thy viols.<p>But let judgment run down as waters,<p>And righteousness as a mighty stream.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. mercy&#8212;put for piety in general, of which mercy or charity is a branch.<p>not sacrifice&#8212;that is, "rather than sacrifice." So "not" is merely comparative (Ex 16:8; Joe 2:13; Joh 6:27; 1Ti 2:14). As God Himself instituted sacrifices, it cannot mean that He desired them not absolutely, but that even in the Old Testament, He valued moral obedience as the only end for which positive ordinances, such as sacrifices, were instituted&#8212;as of more importance than a mere external ritual obedience (1Sa 15:22; Ps 50:8, 9; 51:16; Isa 1:11, 12; Mic 6:6-8; Mt 9:13; 12:7).<p>knowledge of God&#8212;experimental and practical, not merely theoretical (Ho 6:3; Jer 22:16; 1Jo 2:3, 4). "Mercy" refers to the second table of the law, our duty to our fellow man; "the knowledge of God" to the first table, our duty to God, including inward spiritual worship. The second table is put first, not as superior in dignity, for it is secondary, but in the order of our understanding.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hosea/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I so hewed and slew them, because they did not what I most of all required, approved, and could accept of; they were full of sacrifices, and spared them not, but either to idols, or else in formality and pride.

But truth is, who knows God aright, and doth keep his heart for God, gives God more than he that brings whole burnt-offerings; for these are but ceremonies and signs, empty and insipid to God, without the heart. In short, these people acted all so contrary to this temper of their God, gave him so much of that he valued not, and so little of that he did most value, that he could not be too severe against them, nor is it any wonder he was so displeased with their sacrifices. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hosea/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice,.... That is, the one rather than the other, as the next clause explains it. Sacrifices were of early use, even before the law of Moses; they were of divine appointment, and were approved and accepted of by the Lord; they were types of Christ, and led to him, and were continued unto his death; but in comparison of moral duties, which respect love to God, and to our neighbour, the Lord did not will them, desire them, and delight in them; or he had more regard for the former than the latter; see <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; nor did he will or accept at all of the sacrifices ordered to the calves at Dan and Bethel; nor others, when they were not such as the law required, or were not offered up in the faith of Christ, attended with repentance for sin, and in sincerity, and were brought as real expiatory sacrifices for sin, and especially as now abrogated by the sacrifice of Christ. And as these words are twice quoted by our Lord, at one time to justify his mercy, pity, and compassion, to the souls of poor sinners, by conversing with them, <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>; and at another time to justify the disciples in an act of mercy to their bodies when hungry, by plucking ears of corn on the sabbath day, <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>; "mercy" may here respect both acts of mercy shown by the Lord, and acts of mercy done by men; both which the Lord wills, desires, and delights in: he takes pleasure in showing mercy himself, as appears by his free and open declarations of it; by the throne of grace and mercy he has set up; by the encouragement he gives to souls to hope in his mercy; by the objects of it, the chief of sinners; by the various ways he has taken to display it, in election, in the covenant of grace, in the mission of Christ, in the pardon of sin by him, and in regeneration; and by his opposing it to everything else, in the affair of salvation. And he likewise has a very great regard to mercy as exercised by men; as this is one of the weightier matters of the law, and may be put for the whole of it, or however the second table of it, which is love to our neighbours, and takes in all kind offices done to them; and especially designs acts of liberality to necessitous persons; which are sacrifices God is well pleased with, even more than with the ceremonious ones; these being such in which men resemble him the merciful God, who is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil; <p>and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings; which were reckoned the greatest and most excellent sacrifices, the whole being the Lord's; but knowledge of God is preferred to them; by which is meant, not the knowledge of God, the light of nature, which men might have, and not him; nor by the law of Moses, as a lawgiver, judge, and consuming fire; but a knowledge of him in Christ, as the God and Father of Christ, as the God of all grace, gracious and merciful in him; as a covenant God and Father in him, which is through the Gospel by the Spirit, and is eternal life, <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; this includes in it faith and hope in God, love to him, fear of him and his goodness, and the whole worship of him, both internal and external. These words seem designed to expose and remove the false ground of trust and confidence in sacrifices the people of Israel were prone unto; as we find they were in the times of Isaiah, who was contemporary with Hoses; see <a href="/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>. The Targum interprets them of those that exercise mercy, and do the law of the Lord. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hosea/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I desired <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</span><p>(f) He shows to what his doctrine was aimed at, that they should unite the obedience of God, and the love of their neighbour, with outward sacrifices.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hosea/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>.

The parallel clause favours the former, the context at first sight the latter; but we may keep ‘piety’, for both love to God and the knowledge of God are regarded as leading to the imitation of God’s <span class="greekheb">φιλανθρωπία</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/22-16.htm" title="He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? said the LORD.">Jeremiah 22:16</a> ‘was not this to know me’, and <a href="/2_samuel/9-3.htm" title="And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? And Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, which is lame on his feet.">2 Samuel 9:3</a> ‘that I may show the kindness of God unto him’). As Aben Ezra well remarks, it is stedfast love which the prophet means, not that which is like a cloud (<span class="ital"><a href="/hosea/6-4.htm" title="O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.">Hosea 6:4</a></span>). ‘And not sacrifice’ = ‘rather than sacrifice’; the prophet thinks comparatively little of sacrifices, but does not denounce them as positively displeasing to God. Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats....">Isaiah 1:11-20</a>; <a href="/context/micah/6-6.htm" title="With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?...">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/7-22.htm" title="For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:...">Jeremiah 7:22-23</a> (though this is of doubtful interpretation). The sacrifices alluded to are those which the Israelites will at a future time offer in the vain hope of propitiating Jehovah (<a href="/hosea/5-6.htm" title="They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them.">Hosea 5:6</a>). This first half of the verse is twice quoted by our Lord (<a href="/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm" title="But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.">Matthew 12:7</a>). A striking parallel occurs in a saying ascribed to Buddha, who, however, unlike our Lord, denounced animal sacrifices as in themselves wrong: ‘If a man live a hundred years, and engage the whole of his time and attention in religious offerings to the gods, sacrificing elephants and horses, and other life, all this is not equal to one act of pure love in saving life’ (Beal’s <span class="ital">Texts from the Buddhist Canon</span>).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Daniel heard the voice, which according to v. 6 was like the noise of a multitude, he was stunned, and fell on his face to the ground, as <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>.
