Here the <span class="ital">breaking of the bow in the valley of Jezreel </span>is the event that marks the date; and to that date, so marked, the threatened excision of the kingdom of the ten tribes is referred. And it was of moment to give the people warning, that the advantages, which the enemy would gain over them in that part of the country, would end in the utter subversion of the kingdom. For had this timely warning produced repentance and reformation, the judgment, no doubt, would have been averted. St. Jerome says, the Israelites were overthrown by the Assyrians, in a pitched battle, in the plain of Jezreel. But of any such battle we have no mention in history, sacred or profane. But Tiglath-pileser took several of the principal cities in that plain, in the reign of Pekah. And afterward in the reign of Hoshea, Samaria was taken by Shalmaneser, after a siege of three years; and this put an end to the kingdom of the ten tribes. And the taking of these cities successively, and, at last, of the capital itself, was a <span class="ital">breaking of the bow of Israel, </span>a demolition of the whole military strength of the kingdom, <span class="ital">in the valley of Jezreel, </span>where all those cities were situated. For the breaking of a bow was a natural image for the overthrow of military strength in general, at a time when the bow was one of the principal weapons. “Although the <span class="ital">valley of Jezreel </span>is here to be understood literally of the tract of country so named, yet perhaps there is an indirect allusion to the mystical import of the name. This being the finest spot of the whole land of promise, the name, <span class="ital">the vale of Jezreel, </span>describes it as the property of the holy seed, by whom it is at last to be possessed. So that, in the very terms of the denunciation against the kingdom of Israel, an oblique promise is contained, of the restoration of the converted Israelites. The Israel which possessed it, in the time of this prophecy, were not the rightful owners of the soil. It is part of the domain of the Jezreel, <span class="ital">the seed of God, </span>for whom it is reserved.” — Bishop Horsley.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Israel was prosperous, yet then Hosea boldly tells them of their sins, and foretells their destruction. Men are not to be flattered in sinful ways because they prosper in the world; nor will it last long if they go on still in their trespasses. The prophet must show Israel their sin; show it to be exceedingly hateful. Their idolatry is the sin they are here charged with. Giving that glory to any creature which is due to God alone, is an injury and affront to God; such as for a wife to take a stranger, is to her husband. The Lord, doubtless, had good reasons for giving such a command to the prophet; it would form an affecting picture of the Lord's unmerited goodness and unwearied patience, and of the perverseness and ingratitude of Israel. We should be broken and wearied with half that perverseness from others, with which we try the patience and grieve the Spirit of our God. Let us also be ready to bear any cross the Lord appoints. The prophet must show the ruin of the people, in the names given to his children. He foretells the fall of the royal family in the name of his first child: call his name Jezreel, which signifies dispersion. He foretells God's abandoning the nation in the name of the second child; Lo-ruhamah, not beloved, or not having obtained mercy. God showed great mercy, but Israel abused his favours. Sin turns away the mercy of God, even from Israel, his own professing people. If pardoning mercy is denied, no other mercy can be expected. Though some, through unbelief, are broken off, yet God will have a church in this world till the end of time. Our salvation is owing to God's mercy, not to any merit of our own. That salvation is sure, of which he is the Author; and if he will work, none shall hinder.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel - The valley of Jezreel is a beautiful and a broad valley or plain, stretching, from West to East, from Mount Carmel and the sea to the Jordan, which it reaches through two arms, between the Mountains of Gilboa, little Hermon, and Tabor; and from South to North from the Mountains of Ephraim to those of Galilee. Nazareth lay on its northern side. It is called "the great plain" (1 Macc. 12:49), "the great plain of Esdraelon" (Judith 1:8). There God had signally executed His judgments against the enemies of His people, or on His people, when they became His enemies. There He gave the great victories over the invading hosts of Sisera (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a> ff), and of Midian, with the children of the East. <a href="/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>.

There would have been a ‘poetical justice’ in such an arrangement, had such been the will of Providence. But there can be no doubt that Hosea had an accurate knowledge of the Assyrians as the destined instruments of Israel’s overthrow (see on <a href="/hosea/8-10.htm" title="Yes, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.">Hosea 8:10</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it shall some to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel</span>. Here we have a prediction of a most momentous event, with express statement of the place where it should occur, as also the time of its occurrence. The event itself was more than the downfall of a dynasty; it was the destruction of a kingdom. The date of that destruction is defined simply as the period when God would punish the sins of both the princes and people of Israel The close of Jehu's dynasty was at once the preparation for and the commencement of the cessation of the kingdom of Israel. The place of this calamity was the Valley of Jezreel. This famous valley was the cockpit of Palestine. There Israel conquered the host of King Jabin; there Gideon overthrew the Midianites; there Saul was defeated by the Philistines, when driven up the slopes of Gilbea "<span class="accented">the</span> beauty of Israel was slain in thy high places;" there a defeat equally sorrowful and not less disastrous was aggravated by the death of good King Josiah, and proved fatal to the kingdom of Judah; there, too, in later times, the last conflict took place between the Crusaders and the Moslems, in which victory crowned the arms of Saladin; there, also, was fought the battle, as we learn from this passage, which decided the fate of the kingdom of Israel. The situation of this valley was admirably suited for such scenes. This plain, or valley, broad as it is beautiful, begins where the maritime plain, interrupted by the ridge of Carmel, turns aside and extends across the center of the country from the Mediterranean Sea on the west to the Jordan valley on the east, and from the hills of Galilee on the north to those of Ephraim or Samaria on the south. The form of this plain is triangular; its eastern side or base is fifteen miles, reaching from Engannim, now <span class="accented">Jenin</span>, to the hills below Nazareth; the north side along the hills of Galilee is twelve miles; the southern, formed by the hills of Samaria, is eighteen miles; while the apex of this somewhat irregular triangle is a narrow pass through which the river Kishon - "<span class="accented">that</span> ancient river, the river Kishon" - with its winding stream makes its way to the sea. On the east there are three branches in the direction of the Jordan, which bear a remote resemblance to the fingers of a hand. The northern branch <span class="accented">passes</span> between Tabor and Little Hermon, or <span class="accented">Jebel ed-Duhy</span>; the central one, which is the Valley of Jezreel proper, runs between Shunem and Jezreel, now <span class="accented">Zerin</span>; the southern between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim, now <span class="accented">Jenia - this</span> branch, having no outlet, loses itself among the eastern hills. The name of this plain was derived from the city of Jezreel, situated near its eastern extremity on a spur of Mount Gilboa, which Ahab chose as a royal residence, and which remained so for three successive reigns, though in the time of Jeroboam II. Samaria had again, as in the days of Omri, become the royal city. In this great plain, called by the Greeks Esdraelon, the bow of Israel was to be broken. The bow (<span class="accented">qesheth, tad</span>. <span class="accented">qashah</span>, hard, stiff,  unbending) was the warrior's weapon of offence and defense - strong and powerful; the breaking of his bow deprived him of his chief weapon, and left him at the mercy of the enemy to conquer or to kill; thus we read, "His bow abode in strength;" and again, "My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand." But while such general references prove the bow to have been an emblem of strength and power, as Kimchi explains it, still there is something very special and suitable in the expression of the prophet here. "In one important respect," says the author of the 'Jewish Church,' "the ancient military glory of Israel was, if not confined to the northern kingdom yet regarded as eminently characteristic of it. Judah, with all its warlike qualities, had never been celebrated for its archery. The use of the bow was there a late acquisition (<a href="/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>). But in Benjamin and Ephraim it had been an habitual weapon. The bow of Jonathan was known far and wide. The children of Ephraim were characterized as 'carrying bows.' And so the chief weapon of the captain of the host of Israel was his bow. The King of Israel had always his bow and arrows with him. The sign of the fall of the kingdom was the breaking of the bow of Israel." The language employed by the prophet was thus singularly appropriate. An historical basis, though denied by some and pronounced precarious by others, is, we have little doubt, found for this prediction in <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a> of this very book. The bow, that is, the archery in which Israel excelled so much, was broken in the Valley of Jezreel, when Shalmon, identified with Shalman-ezer, King of Assyria by Pusey and Stanley, spoiled Beth-Arbel, or Arbela, the city between Sepphoris and Tiberias, and near the middle of the valley, and thus crushed Israel in an overwhelming defeat. If the identification be sustained, that day of battle was most calamitous to Israel, and as cruel as calamitous, for neither the helplessness of infancy nor the tenderness of womanhood was spared; the infants were dashed to death against the stones, and the mothers then hurled in mortal agony upon the dead bodies of their little ones. Kimchi explains it generally: "On that day when I shall visit the blood of Jezreel, I shall break the bow of Israel, that is to <span class="accented">say</span>, their might and power." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17-27</a> the angel gives the wished-for explanation. In <a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a> he gives first a general interpretation of the vision. The words, these great beasts, of which there were four, form an absolute nominal clause: "as for the beasts;" as concerning their meaning, it is this: "they represent four kings." The kings are named as founders and representatives of world-kingdoms. Four kingdoms are meant, as <a href="/daniel/7-23.htm">Daniel 7:23</a> shows, where the fourth beast is explained as &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, "dominion," "kingdom." Compare also <a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, where in like manner kings are named and kingdoms are meant. From the future &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (shall arise) Hitzig concludes that the first kingdom was yet future, and therefore, that since Daniel had the vision under Belshazzar, the first king could only be Belshazzar, but could not represent the Chaldean monarchy. But if from the words shall arise it follows that the vision is only of kings who arise in the future, then, since Daniel saw the vision in the first year of Belshazzar, it cannot of course be Belshazzar who is represented by the first beast; and if Belshazzar was, as Hitzig thinks, the last king of Chaldea, than the entire Chaldean monarchy is excluded from the number of the four great beasts. Kranichfeld therefore understands this word as modal, and interprets it should arise. This was the divine decree by which also the duration of their kingdoms was determined (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>). But the modal interpretation does not agree with <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>, according to which the angel wishes to make known the meaning of the matter to Daniel, not to show what was determined in the divine counsel, but what God had revealed to him by the beasts rising up out of the sea. The future, shall arise, is rather (Ros., v. Leng., Maur., Klief., etc.) for the purpose of declaring that the vision represents the development of the world-power as a whole, as it would unfold itself in four successive phases; whereupon the angel so summarily interprets the vision to the prophet, that, dating from the time of their origin, he points out the first world-kingdom as arising along with the rest, notwithstanding that it had already come into existence, and only its last stages were then future. The thought of this summary interpretation is manifestly nothing else than this: "Four kingdoms shall arise on the earth, and shall again disappear; but the saints of God shall receive the kingdom which shall have an everlasting duration." &#1497;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, receive; not found and establish by their own might, but receive through the Son of man, to whom God (<a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>) has given it. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>) is the name of God, the Most High, analogous to the plur. forms &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. "The saints of the Most High," or briefly "the saints" (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>), are neither the Jews, who are accustomed to call themselves "saints," in contrast with the heathen (v. Leng., Maur., Hitzig, etc.), nor the converted Israel of the millennium (Hofmann and other chiliasts), but, as we argue from <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, the true members of the covenant nation, the New Testament Israel of God, i.e., the congregation of the New Covenant, consisting of Israel and the faithful of all nations; for the kingdom which God gives to the Son of man will, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, comprehend those that are redeemed from among all the nations of the earth. The idea of the everlasting duration of their kingdom is, by the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1506;&#1500;&#1501; (for ever and ever), raised to the superlative degree.<p>The angel does not here give further explanations regarding the first three kingdoms. Since the second chapter treats of them, and the eighth also gives further description of the second and third, it is enough here to state that the first three beasts represent those kingdoms that are mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>. The form of the fourth beast, however, comprehends much more regarding the fourth world-kingdom that the dream-image of Nebuchadnezzar did. Therefore Daniel asks the angel further for certain information (certainty) regarding the dreadful form of this beast, and consequently the principal outlines of the representation before given of it are repeated by him in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-19.htm">Daniel 7:19-21</a>, and are completed by certain circumstances there omitted. Thus <a href="/daniel/7-19.htm">Daniel 7:19</a> presents the addition, that the beast had, along with iron teeth, also claws of brass, with which it stamped to pieces what it could not devour; and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>, that the little horn became greater than its fellows, made war against the people of God and overcame them, till the judgment brought its dominion to an end. &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, I wished or sure knowledge, i.e., to experience certainty regarding it.</body></html>
