Of her three children here mentioned, the eldest and the youngest were sons, the intermediate child was a daughter. “The eldest,” says Bishop Horsley, “I think, was the prophet’s son; but the last two were both bastards. In this I have the concurrence of Dr. Wells, acutely remarking, that whereas it is said, <a href="/hosea/1-3.htm" title="So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bore him a son.">Hosea 1:3</a>, that the prophet’s wife conceived and bare a son <span class="ital">to him, </span>it is said of the other two children, only that she conceived and bare them; implying that the children she then bare, not being born, like the first, to the prophet, were not begotten by him.” Now, as the name imposed, by God’s direction, upon the eldest child, the prophet’s own son, typified the true children of God, and heirs of the promises among the Israelites; so the two bastard children, the bishop thinks, typified those parts of the Jewish people that were not Jezreel, or the seed of God. The first of these, the daughter, whose sex was the emblem of weakness, was called <span class="ital">Lo-ruhamah, </span>which signifies, <span class="ital">unbeloved, </span>or <span class="ital">unpitied, </span>or, as it is in the margin, in conformity with all the ancient visions, <span class="ital">not having obtained mercy. </span>“This daughter typified the people of the ten tribes, in the enfeebled state of their declining monarchy, torn by their intestine commotions and perpetual revolutions, harassed by powerful invaders, empoverished by their tyrannical exactions, and condemned by the just sentence of God to utter excision as a distinct kingdom, without hope of restoration: for so the type is explained by God himself,” declaring, <span class="ital">I will utterly take them away — </span>That is, I will cause them to be carried into captivity, never to return again in a body; and will utterly put an end to them, considered as a kingdom, or people distinct from Judah. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hosea/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Israel was prosperous, yet then Hosea boldly tells them of their sins, and foretells their destruction. Men are not to be flattered in sinful ways because they prosper in the world; nor will it last long if they go on still in their trespasses. The prophet must show Israel their sin; show it to be exceedingly hateful. Their idolatry is the sin they are here charged with. Giving that glory to any creature which is due to God alone, is an injury and affront to God; such as for a wife to take a stranger, is to her husband. The Lord, doubtless, had good reasons for giving such a command to the prophet; it would form an affecting picture of the Lord's unmerited goodness and unwearied patience, and of the perverseness and ingratitude of Israel. We should be broken and wearied with half that perverseness from others, with which we try the patience and grieve the Spirit of our God. Let us also be ready to bear any cross the Lord appoints. The prophet must show the ruin of the people, in the names given to his children. He foretells the fall of the royal family in the name of his first child: call his name Jezreel, which signifies dispersion. He foretells God's abandoning the nation in the name of the second child; Lo-ruhamah, not beloved, or not having obtained mercy. God showed great mercy, but Israel abused his favours. Sin turns away the mercy of God, even from Israel, his own professing people. If pardoning mercy is denied, no other mercy can be expected. Though some, through unbelief, are broken off, yet God will have a church in this world till the end of time. Our salvation is owing to God's mercy, not to any merit of our own. That salvation is sure, of which he is the Author; and if he will work, none shall hinder.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hosea/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Call her name Lo-ruhamah - The name is rendered in Paul "not beloved" <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a>, in Peter, "hath not obtained mercy" <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>. Love and mercy are both contained in the full meaning of the intensive form of the Hebrew word, which expresses the deep tender yearnings of the inmost soul over one loved; as in the words <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>, "As a father pitieth (yearneth over) his own children, so the Lord pitieth (yearneth over) them that fear Him." It is "tender love" in Him who pitieth; "mercy," as shown to him who needeth mercy. The punishment, foretold under the name of the daughter, "Unpitied," is a great enlargement of that conveyed under the name of the first son, "God shall scatter." Judah too was carried captive, and scattered; but after the 70 years, she was restored. The 10 tribes, it is now foretold, when scattered, should, as a whole, be cut off from the tender mercy of God, scattered by Him, and as a whole, never be restored. Those only were restored, who, when Judah returned from captivity, clave to her, or subsequently, one by one, were united to her.<p>But I will utterly take them away - Literally, "for, taking away, I will take away from them, or with regard to them," namely, everything . He specifies nothing; He excepts nothing; only, with that awful emphasis, He dwells on the taking away, as that which He had determined to do to the utmost. This is the thought, which He wills to dwell on the As a little while after, God says, that He would be nothing to them, so here, where He in fact repeats this one thought, "take away, take away, from them," the guilty conscience of Israel would at once, supply, "all." When God threatens, the sinful or awakened soul sees instinctively what draws down the lightning of God's wrath, and where it will fall. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

It is too nice which Ribera observes, that the state grew weaker, as appeared by the bringing forth of one of the weaker sex.

And God said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah. The first birth symbolized the blood-guiltiness and idolatry of Israel, and the consequent destruction. Two other births follow to confirm the certainty of the coming calamity, to develop it further, and exhibit the nation ever which it impended under new phases, as also to show the prospect of deliverance to be hopeless. The change of sex may indicate the totality of the nation, male and female, as Keil thinks; or rather the weak and defenseless condition of Israel after their bow was broken and their power crushed by the enemy. They are new ready to be led into captivity, like a female helpless and powerless and exposed to ell the insults of the conquerors. The birth of the daughter is thus explained by Kimchi: "After she had borne a so which is a proverbial reference to Jeroboam the son of Joash...  she bore a daughter, who refers parabolically to Zechariah and to Shallum son of Jabesh, who reigned after him, who were weak as a female." The name given to the child is <span class="accented">Unpitied</span>, or Unfavored, if <span class="accented">ruchamah be</span> taken as a mutilated participle, the initial <span class="accented">mere</span> being dropped, though it is not found in close connection with a participle; or, <span class="accented">She-is-not-pitied</span>, if the word be a verb. In either case, the mercy which if exercised would save her from the miseries of captivity, is clean gone; and the love which, if it existed, would prompt that exercise of mercy, is no longer to be looked for. <span class="cmt_word">For I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away</span> (margin, <span class="accented">that I should altogether pardon them</span>). Aben Ezra quotes the correct meaning as follows: "Some say that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> is that I have up till now forgiven their iniquity; "and Kimchi: "Hitherto I have forgiven and pardoned them, because I have had mercy upon them; but I shall continue to do so no more." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">again</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>, to return or repeat. The construction of the first clause is peculiar. Rosenm&uuml;ller cites as parallel <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a> and <a href="/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a>; but more exact parallels are <a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a> and <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>, in both of which, and also in the text, Kimchi and Aben Ezra understand <span class="accented">asker</span> before the second verb. The last clause of the verse, however, presents a real difficulty, as we may infer from the variety of interpretations to which it has been subjected. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "But I will surely set myself in array against them." Jerome, confounding the verb with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span> translates, "But I will entirely forget them." Rashi: "I will <span class="accented">distribute to them a portion of their cup</span> and of their deeds," viz. as they have deserved by their deeds, Kimchi: "I will <span class="accented">raise up enemies against them</span>, who shall carry them into captivity and lay waste their land."Aben Ezra: "I will take them away;" he quotes for this meaning of the text <a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>, and takes the prefix <span class="accented">le</span> as the Aramaic sign of the accusative, giving as a notable example of the same <a href="/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>, <span class="accented">haregu leabner</span> for <span class="accented">eth-abner</span>. The Syriac Version is similar. A more feasible rendering, if the meaning of "take away" be retained, is that of Hengstenberg and others, who translate it: "I will utterly take away from them, or with regard to them," viz. everything. We prefer the sense of "pardon," as given in the Chaldee; in the margin of the Authorized Version; by Ewald, Wunsche, and Delitzsch; and mentioned by Aben Ezra and Kimchi. Thus it will read: "I will no more favor them that I should verily forgive them." The flint verb literally means the pitiful yearning of parental love - the strong feeling of affection which the Greeks expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>. Paul's rendering of the word with the privative denotes absence of love; and Peter's the absence of mercy. Both notions are contained in the word, and their relation is well explained by Pussy, who says, It is <span class="accented">tender love</span> in him who pitieth; mercy as shown to him who needeth mercy." Now, the connection between such tenderness of love and forgiving mercy is natural and close. Many an instance of this had been experienced in the previous history of Israel; many a time God's compassion had been extended to his erring people, notwithstanding their manifold provocations; but that day is gone - the Divine long-suffering is exhausted. Once Israel is carried captive, there shall be no return; no mercy to restore them, as in the case of Judah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17-27</a> the angel gives the wished-for explanation. In <a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a> he gives first a general interpretation of the vision. The words, these great beasts, of which there were four, form an absolute nominal clause: "as for the beasts;" as concerning their meaning, it is this: "they represent four kings." The kings are named as founders and representatives of world-kingdoms. Four kingdoms are meant, as <a href="/daniel/7-23.htm">Daniel 7:23</a> shows, where the fourth beast is explained as &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, "dominion," "kingdom." Compare also <a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm">Daniel 8:21</a>, where in like manner kings are named and kingdoms are meant. From the future &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (shall arise) Hitzig concludes that the first kingdom was yet future, and therefore, that since Daniel had the vision under Belshazzar, the first king could only be Belshazzar, but could not represent the Chaldean monarchy. But if from the words shall arise it follows that the vision is only of kings who arise in the future, then, since Daniel saw the vision in the first year of Belshazzar, it cannot of course be Belshazzar who is represented by the first beast; and if Belshazzar was, as Hitzig thinks, the last king of Chaldea, than the entire Chaldean monarchy is excluded from the number of the four great beasts. Kranichfeld therefore understands this word as modal, and interprets it should arise. This was the divine decree by which also the duration of their kingdoms was determined (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>). But the modal interpretation does not agree with <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>, according to which the angel wishes to make known the meaning of the matter to Daniel, not to show what was determined in the divine counsel, but what God had revealed to him by the beasts rising up out of the sea. The future, shall arise, is rather (Ros., v. Leng., Maur., Klief., etc.) for the purpose of declaring that the vision represents the development of the world-power as a whole, as it would unfold itself in four successive phases; whereupon the angel so summarily interprets the vision to the prophet, that, dating from the time of their origin, he points out the first world-kingdom as arising along with the rest, notwithstanding that it had already come into existence, and only its last stages were then future. The thought of this summary interpretation is manifestly nothing else than this: "Four kingdoms shall arise on the earth, and shall again disappear; but the saints of God shall receive the kingdom which shall have an everlasting duration." &#1497;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, receive; not found and establish by their own might, but receive through the Son of man, to whom God (<a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>) has given it. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>) is the name of God, the Most High, analogous to the plur. forms &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. "The saints of the Most High," or briefly "the saints" (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>), are neither the Jews, who are accustomed to call themselves "saints," in contrast with the heathen (v. Leng., Maur., Hitzig, etc.), nor the converted Israel of the millennium (Hofmann and other chiliasts), but, as we argue from <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, the true members of the covenant nation, the New Testament Israel of God, i.e., the congregation of the New Covenant, consisting of Israel and the faithful of all nations; for the kingdom which God gives to the Son of man will, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, comprehend those that are redeemed from among all the nations of the earth. The idea of the everlasting duration of their kingdom is, by the words &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1506;&#1500;&#1501; (for ever and ever), raised to the superlative degree.<p>The angel does not here give further explanations regarding the first three kingdoms. Since the second chapter treats of them, and the eighth also gives further description of the second and third, it is enough here to state that the first three beasts represent those kingdoms that are mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>. The form of the fourth beast, however, comprehends much more regarding the fourth world-kingdom that the dream-image of Nebuchadnezzar did. Therefore Daniel asks the angel further for certain information (certainty) regarding the dreadful form of this beast, and consequently the principal outlines of the representation before given of it are repeated by him in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-19.htm">Daniel 7:19-21</a>, and are completed by certain circumstances there omitted. Thus <a href="/daniel/7-19.htm">Daniel 7:19</a> presents the addition, that the beast had, along with iron teeth, also claws of brass, with which it stamped to pieces what it could not devour; and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>, that the little horn became greater than its fellows, made war against the people of God and overcame them, till the judgment brought its dominion to an end. &#1510;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, I wished or sure knowledge, i.e., to experience certainty regarding it.</body></html>
