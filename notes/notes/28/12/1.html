They are put in mind of what Jacob did, and what God did for him. When his faith upon the Divine promise prevailed above his fears, then by his strength he had power with God. He is Jehovah, the same that was, and is, and is to come. What was a revelation of God to one, is his memorial to many, to all generations. Then let those who have gone from God, be turned to him. Turn thou to the Lord, by repentance and faith, as thy God. Let those that are converted to him, walk with him in all holy conversation and godliness.

"The East wind carrieth him away and he departeth, and as a whirlwind hurleth him out of his place." In leaving God and following idols, Ephraim "fed on" what is unsatisfying, and chased after what is destructive. If a hungry man were to "feed on wind," it would be light food. If a man could overtake the East wind, it were his destruction. : Israel "fed on wind," when he sought by gifts to win one who could aid him no more than the wind; "he chased the East wind," when, in place of the gain which he sought, he received from the patron whom he had adopted, no slight loss." Israel sought for the scorching wind, when it could betake itself under the shadow of God. : "The scorching wind is the burning of calamities, and the consuming fire of affliction."<p>He increaseth lies and desolation - Unrepented sins and their punishment are, in God's govermnent, linked together; so that to multiply sin is, in fact, to multiply desolation. Sin and punishment are bound together, as cause and effect. Man overlooks what he does not see. Yet not the less does he "treasure up wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God" <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>. : "Lying" will signify false speaking, false dealing, false belief, false opinions, false worship, false pretences for color thereof, false hopes, or relying on things that will deceive. In all these kinds, was Ephraim at that time guilty, adding one sort of lying to another."<p>They do make a covenant with the Assyrians and oil is carried into Egypt - Oil was a chief product of Palestine, from where it is called "a land of oil olive" <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>; and "oil" with balm was among its chief exports to Tyre (<a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>; see the note above at <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>). It may also include precious ointments, of which it was the basis. As an export of great value, it stands for all other presents, which Hoshea sent to So, King of Egypt. Ephraim, threatened by God, looked first to the Assyrian, then to Egypt, to strengthen itself. Having dealt falsely with God, he dealt falsely with man. First, he "made covenant with" Shalmaneser, king of "Assyria;" then, finding the tribute, the price of his help, burdensome to him, he broke that covenant, by sending to Egypt. Seeking to make friends out of God, Ephraim made the more powerful, the Assyrian, the more his enemy, by seeking the friendship of Egypt; and God executed His judgments through those, by whose help they had hoped to escape them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hosea/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Ho 12:1-14.

According to this view, the prominent idea of the east wind is its fleetness, which passed into a proverb; thus Horace says, "Agents nimbos Oeior Euro." To outrun the swift and stormy east wind would represent an undertaking at once impracticable and hopeless. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the blasting influence of the east wind that is referred to, so that it is a figurative representation, not so much of what is vain and hopeless, as of what is pernicious and destructive. Thus their course was not only idle, but injurious; not only delusive, but destructive; not only fruitless, but fatal. Their career, which is thus represented, included their idolatry and foreign alliances Kimchi explains this clause as follows: "In his service of the calves he is like him who opens his mouth to the wind and feeds on it, though he cannot support life thereby." And followeth after the east wind; ' he repeats the sense in different words, and mentions the east wind because it is the strongest and most injurious of winds to the sons of men. So with them: it is not enough that the idolatry of the calves does not profit them, but it actually injures them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The Septuagint rendering is <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to "But Ephraim is an evil spirit; he has chased the east wind." <span class="cmt_word">He daily</span> (rather, <span class="accented">all the day</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>increaseth lies and desolation.</span> Some understood these words <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as descriptive of Ephraim's attitude towards Jehovah; and thus what is figuratively set forth in the first clause is here represented literally. Thus Kimchi says, "He does not turn back from his wickedness, but all the days he multiplies lying which is the worship of the calves, and so increases the desolation and destruction that shall come as a punishment for their service. And with all this he does not perceive nor return from the worship of the calves to the worship of the blessed God." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> we prefer understanding the second clause of Ephraim's conduct towards his neighbor or fellow-man. Titus, Hitzig, who shows that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> cannot refer to their conduct towards Jehovah, nor could their lies and desolation continue the whole day if referred to his service. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;</span>, "<span class="accented">violence and</span> <span class="accented">robbery</span>," or "spoil," are also jointed in a similar manner in <a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>, to characterize men's conduct towards their neighbors. In the passage before us, if we refer the words, "lies and desolation," as we think they ought to be referred, to Ephraim's conduct towards men, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span> may be distinguished thus: the former designates low lying and fraudulent dealing; while the latter expresses that brutal violence by which dishonest men unscrupulously take possession of their neighbors' property. <span class="cmt_word">And they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt</span>. This fondness for foreign alliances is specified as a positive proof of their apostasy from, and want of confidence in, Jehovah. This is well explained by Kimchi in the following comment: "But what doeth Ephraim? When oppression of the enemy comes upon him, they make a covenant with Assyria for their assistance, and likewise with Egypt - one time with this, another time with that." The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, "to cut a covenant," has its parallel in the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and Latin <span class="accented">foedus fetire</span>, as also in the Arabic, doubtless from the circumstance of slaying the victims in its ratification. The conduct here censured is Ephraim's faithlessness to the then static covenant rather than their treacherous maneuvering in "playing off" Egypt against Assyria, and Assyria against Egypt alternately. The land of Israel abounded in oil-olive and honey, as we read in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a> and elsewhere. The object of sending it to Egypt was as a present to the Egyptians to secure their interest and help against Assyria. It is thus properly explained both by Rash! and Kimchi. The former says, "And their oil they bring to Egypt to give it to them as a present that they may help them;" the latter likewise, "They bring their oil to the Egyptians for a present, for oil came to Egypt and to other lands out of the land of Israel. The land of Israel was rich in olive oil." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb. Bib. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1-3</a>). To the symbolical action, which depicts the judgment that falls blow after blow upon the ten tribes, issuing in the destruction of the kingdom, and the banishment of its inhabitants, there is now appended, quite abruptly, the saving announcement of the final restoration of those who turn to the Lord.<p>(Note: The division adopted in the Hebrew text, where these verses are separated from the preceding ones, and joined to the next verse, is opposed to the general arrangement of the prophetic proclamations, which always begin with reproving the sins, then describe the punishment or judgment, and close with the announcement of salvation. The division adopted by the lxx and Vulg., and followed by Luther (and Eng. ver.: Tr.), in which these two verses form part of the first chapter, and the new chapter is made to commence with <a href="/hosea/1-3.htm">Hosea 1:3</a> (of the Hebrew), on account of its similarity to <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>, is still more unsuitable, since this severs the close connection between the subject-matter of <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a> and that of <a href="/hosea/1-3.htm">Hosea 1:3</a> in the most unnatural way.)<p><a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a><p>(Heb. Bib. <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>). "And the number of the sons of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which is not measured and not counted; and it will come to pass at the place where men say to them, Ye are not my people, it will be said to them, Sons of the living God." It might appear as though the promise made to the patriarchs, of the innumerable increase of Israel, were abolished by the rejection of the ten tribes of Israel predicted here. But this appearance, which might confirm the ungodly in their false security, is met by the proclamation of salvation, which we must connect by means of a "nevertheless" with the preceding announcement of punishment. The almost verbal agreement between this announcement of salvation and the patriarchal promises, more especially in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>, does indeed naturally suggest the idea, that by the "sons of Israel," whose innumerable increase is here predicted, we are to understand all the descendants of Jacob or of Israel as a whole. But if we notice the second clause, according to which those who are called "not-my-people" will then be called "sons of the living God;" and still more, if we observe the distinction drawn between the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-11.htm">Genesis 32:11</a>, this idea is proved to be quite untenable, since the "sons of Israel" can only be the ten tribes. We must assume, therefore, that the prophet had in his mind only one portion of the entire nation, namely, the one with which alone he was here concerned, and that he proclaims that, even with regard to this, the promise in question will one day be fulfilled. In what way, is stated in the second clause. At the place where (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; does not mean "instead of" or "in the place of," as the Latin loco does; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-24.htm">Leviticus 4:24</a>, <a href="/leviticus/4-33.htm">Leviticus 4:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-12.htm">Jeremiah 22:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-35.htm">Ezekiel 21:35</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-14.htm">Nehemiah 4:14</a>) men called them Lo&#772;'-&#8219;amm&#305;&#772;, they shall be called sons of the living God. This place must be either Palestine, where their rejection was declared by means of this name, or the land of exile, where this name became an actual truth. The correctness of the latter view, which is the one given in the Chaldee, is proved by <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-11.htm">Genesis 32:11</a>, where their coming up out of the land of exile is spoken of, from which it is evident that the change is to take place in exile. Jehovah is called El chai, the living God, in opposition to the idols which idolatrous Israel had made for itself; and "sons of the living God" expresses the thought, that Israel would come again into the right relation to the true God, and reach the goal of its divine calling. For the whole nation was called and elevated into the position of sons of Jehovah, through its reception into the covenant with the Lord (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a>, with <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>).</body></html>
