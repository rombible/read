They carried on trade upon Canaanitish principles, covetously and with fraud and deceit. Thus they became rich, and falsely supposed that Providence favoured them. But shameful sins shall have shameful punishments. Let them remember, not only what a mighty prince Jacob was with God, but what a servant he was to Laban. The benefits we have had from the word of God, make our sin and folly the worse, if we put any slight upon that word. We had better follow the hardest labour in poverty, than grow rich by sin. We may form a judgment of our own conduct, by comparing it with that of ancient believers in the like circumstances. Whoever despises the message of God, will perish.

Somewhat like this, is what Ezekiel says, "the hand of the Lord was strong upon me" (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>, ...). God declares, in what way He had been their God "from the land of Egypt." Their ignorance of Him was without excuse, for He had always taught them, although they ever sought the false prophets, and persecuted the true. He taught them continually and in divers ways, if so be any impression might be made upon them. He taught them, either in plain words, or in the "visions" which He "multiplied" to the prophets; or in the "similitudes" or parables, which He taught through their ministry. In the "vision," God is understood to have represented the things to come, as a picture, to the prophet's mind, , "whether the picture were presented to his bodily eyes, or impressed on his imagination, and that, either in a dream, or without a dream."<p>The "similitude," which God says that He repeatedly, continually, used, seems to have been the parable, as when God compared His people to a vine, Himself to the Lord of the vineyard, or when He directed His prophets to do acts which should shadow forth some truth, as in the marriage of Hosea himself. God had said to Aaron, that He would thus make Himself known by the prophets. "If there be a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will make Myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all My house. With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches" <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>. "The dark speech" in Moses answers to the "similitude" of Hosea; the "vision" and "dream" in Moses are comprehended in "visions," as used by Hosea. The prophet Joel also says, "your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions" <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>. So little ground then have they, who speak of the visions of Daniel and Zechariah, as if they belonged to a later age. : "I have instructed," God saith, "men of God, to form thee to piety, enlightening their minds with manifold knowledge of the things of God. And because the light of divine wisdom could not otherwise shine on people placed here below in the prison-house of the body, I had them taught through figures and corporeal images, that, through them, they might rise to the incorporeal, and receive some knowledge of divine and heavenly things.

The preterit denotes what has been taking place up to the present. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> is explained <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by Knobel to denote that the Divine revelation or inspiration descended on the prophets from heaven; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi explains it as equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, with; thus: "'Upon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) the prophets ' is the same as ' with (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) the prophets,' as (in <a href="/exodus/35-32.htm">Exodus 35:32</a>), 'And they came both men and women [literally, 'men, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented">with</span>, or rather in addition to, women']. He (Jehovah) says, 'What could I do to you and I did not do it, so that ye should not forget me? And what did I do with your fathers? I spoke constantly with the prophets to admonish you from me, and I multiplied visions to you many days.'" The Authorized Version <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> employs "by" as the equivalent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> here. The pronoun <span class="accented">v'anoki</span> is emphatic, viz. "I even I," as though he said, "I and not another;" while the preterit proves Jehovah to have continued his visions to the very moment at which the prophet speaks. To the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> use similitudes, some supply a verbal noun of corporate sense, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This, however, is unnecessary, as a verb often includes its cognate noun, of which we have several similar ellipses, e.g. <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, "They bare <span class="accented">children</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> understood] to them;" also <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, "They shall set themselves in array [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> understood] against her." The LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> has <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was represented; "and Jerome renders it <span class="accented">assimilatus sum</span>. The three modes of Divine communication here referred to are prediction, vision, and similitude. The word for <span class="accented">vision</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, is used here as a collective; it differs from the dream in being higher degree of Divine revelation, also the senses of the receiver are awake and active, while in the dream they are inoperative and passive. Of the <span class="accented">similitude</span>, again, we have examples in Isaiah's parable of a vineyard (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>.), and in Ezekiel's similitude of a wretched infant, to represent the natural state of Jerusalem. Aben Ezra remarks, I have established emblems and comparisons that ye might understand me;" and Kimchi, "I have given emblems and parables by means of the prophets, as Isaiah says, 'My well-beloved hath a vineyard;' and Ezekiel, 'Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan.' And the explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> is that by their hand he sends them emblems and similitudes as (<a href="/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>) 'which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses'" Thus God, as Rosenm&uuml;ller observes, "left no means of admonishing them untried." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 11</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity.</span> In reference to hypotheticals, Driver remarks, "With an <span class="accented">imperfect</span> in protasis.

The first part of this clause has been variously rendered. Some take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> affirmatively, in the sense <span class="accented">of certainly, assuredly</span>; others translate it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> interrogatively, as in the Authorized Version, though even thus it would be more accurately rendered: <span class="accented">Is Gilead iniquity of</span> Pusey, following the common version, explains it as follows: 'The prophet asks the question in order to answer it more peremptorily. He raises the doubt in order to crush it the more impressively.' Is there iniquity in Gilead? 'Alas I there was nothing else. <span class="accented">Surely they are vanity</span>; or, strictly, <span class="accented">they have become merely vanity</span>." There does not appear, however, sufficient reason for departing from the ordinary meaning of the word, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> namely, <span class="accented">if</span> thus, <span class="accented">If Gilead i, iniquity</span> (worthlessness), <span class="accented">surely they have become vanity</span>. The clause thus rendered may denote one of two things - either - (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) moral worthlessness followed by physical nothingness, that is, moral decay followed by physical - sin succeeded by suffering; or (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) progress in moral corruption. To the former exposition corresponds the comment of Kimchi, as follows: "'If Gilead began to work vanity (nothingness),' for they began to do wickedness first, and they have been first carried into captivity. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> can connect itself with what precedes, so that its meaning is about Gilead which he has mentioned, and the sense would be repeated in different words. Or its sense shall be in connection with Gilgal. And although zakeph is on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, all the accents of the inter. prefers do not follow after the accents of the points." Similarly Rashi: "If disaster and oppression come upon them (the Gileadites) they have caused it to themselves, for certainly they are worthlessness, and sacrifies bullocks to idols in Gilgal. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> is a prophetic perfect implying the certainty of the prediction, as though already an accomplished fact." The exposition of Aben Ezra favors (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>); thus: "If the Gileadites, before I sent prophets to them, were worthlessness, surely they have become vanity, that is, instead of being morally better, they have become worse." To this exposition we find a parallel in <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>, "They have walked after vanity, and are become vain." <span class="cmt_word">They sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>. The inhabitanta of Gilgal on the west were no better than the Gileadites on the east of Jordan; the whole kingdom, in fact, was overrun with idolatry. The sin of the people of Gilgal did not consist in the animals offered, but in the unlawfulness of the place of sacrifice. The punishment of both Gilgal and Gilead is denounced in the following part of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</span> Gilead signified" heap of witnesses," and Gilgal "heaping heap. The latter was mentioned in <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a> and Hosea 9:15 as a notable center of idol-worship ("all their wickedness is in Gilgal") and retained, as we learn from the present passage, its notoriety for unlawful sacrifices, sacrifices customarily and continually offered (viz. iterative sense of Piel); the former was signalized in <a href="/hosea/6-8.htm">Hosea 6:8</a> as "a city of them that work iniquity," and "polluted with blood." The altars in both places are to be turned into stone-heaps; this is expressed by a play on words so frequent in Hebrew; at Gilead as well as Gilgal they are to become <span class="accented">gallim</span>, or heaps of stones, such as husbandmen gather off ploughed and leave in useless heaps for the greater convenience of removal, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (related to toll, a hill, that which is thrown up) is a furrow as formed by casting up or tearing into. The ruinous heaps of the altars implied, not only their destruction, but the desolation of the country. The altars would become dilapidated heaps, and the country depopulated. The Hebrew interpreters, however, connect with the heap-like altars the idea of number and conspicuousness: this they make prominent as indicating the gross idolatry of the people. Thus Rabbi: "Their altars are numerous as heaps in the furrows of the field. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;</span> is the furrow of the plougher, called <span class="accented">telem</span>;" Aben Ezra: "<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> is by way of figure, because they were numerous and conspicuous." Pococke combines with the idea of number that of ruinous heaps - "rude heaps of stones, in his sight; and such they should become, no one stone being left in order upon another." Kimchi's comment on the verse is the following: "The children of Gilgal were neighbors to the land of Gilead, only the Jordan was between them; they learnt also their ways (doings), and began to serve idols like them, and to practice iniquity and vanity, and sacrificed oxen to strange gods in the place where they had raised an altar to Jehovah the blessed, and where they had set up the tabernacle at the first after they had passed over Jordan: there also they sacrificed oxen to their idols. Not enough that they made an altar in Gilgal to idols, but they also built outside the city altars many and conspicuous, like heaps of stones on the furrows of the field." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Therefore (because the woman says this), behold, thus will I hedge up thy way with thorns, and wall up a wall, and she shall not find her paths." The hedging up of the way, strengthened by the similar figure of the building of a wall to cut off the way, denotes her transportation into a situation in which she could no longer continue her adultery with the idols. The reference is to distress and tribulation (compare <a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a> with <a href="/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>; <a href="/job/3-23.htm">Job 3:23</a>; <a href="/job/19-8.htm">Job 19:8</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>), especially the distress and anguish of exile, in which, although Israel was in the midst of idolatrous nations, and therefore had even more outward opportunity to practise idolatry, it learned the worthlessness of all trust in idols, and their utter inability to help, and was thus impelled to reflect and turn to the Lord, who smites and heals (<a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>).<p>This thought is carried out still further in <a href="/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a> : "And she will pursue her lovers, and not overtake them; and seek them, and not find them: and will say, I will go and return to my first husband, for it was better with me then than now." Distress at first increases their zeal in idolatry, but it soon brings them to see that the idols afford no help. The failure to reach or find the lovers, who are sought with zeal (ridde&#772;ph, piel in an intensive sense, to pursue eagerly), denotes the failure to secure what is sought from them, viz., the anticipated deliverance from the calamity, which the living God has sent as a punishment. This sad experience awakens the desire to return to the faithful covenant God, and the acknowledgment that prosperity and all good things are to be found in vital fellowship with Him.<p>The thought that God will fill the idolatrous nation with disgust at its coquetry with strange gods, by taking away all its possessions, and thus putting to shame its delusive fancy that the possessions which it enjoyed really came from the idols, is still further expanded in the second strophe, commencing with the eighth verse. <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>. "And she knows not that I have given her the corn, and the must, and the oil, and have multiplied silver to her, and gold, which they have used for Baal." Corn, must, and oil are specified with the definite article as being the fruits of the land, which Israel received from year to year. These possessions were the foundation of the nation's wealth, through which gold and silver were multiplied. Ignorance of the fact that Jehovah was the giver of these blessings, was a sin. That Jehovah had given the land to His people, was impressed upon the minds of the people for all time, together with the recollection of the mighty acts of the Lord, by the manner in which Israel had been put in possession of Canaan; and not only had Moses again and again reminded the Israelites most solemnly that it was He who gave rain to the land, and multiplied and blessed its fruitfulness and its fruits (compare, for example, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14-15</a>), but this was also perpetually called to their remembrance by the law concerning the offering of the first-fruits at the feasts. The words &#8219;a&#770;su&#772; labba&#8219;al are to be taken as a relative clause without 'asher, though not in the sense of "which they have made into Baal," i.e., out of which they have made Baal-images (Chald., Rabb., Hitzig, Ewald, and others); for even though &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; occurs in this sense in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-17.htm">Isaiah 44:17</a>, the article, which is wanting in Isaiah, and also in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>, precludes such an explanation here, apart from the fact that habba&#8219;al cannot stand by itself for a statue of Baal. Here &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1500; has rather the general meaning "apply to anything," just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>, where it occurs in a perfectly similar train of thought. This use of the word may be obtained from the meaning "to prepare for anything," whereas the meaning "to offer," which Gesenius adopts ("which they have offered to Baal"), is untenable, since &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; simply denotes the preparation of the sacrifice for the altar, which is out of the question in the case of silver and gold. They had applied their gold and silver to Baal, however, not merely by using them for the preparation of idols, but by employing them in the maintenance and extension of the worship of Baal, or even by regarding them as gifts of Baal, and thus confirming themselves in the zealous worship of that god. By habba'al we are not simply to understand the Canaanitish or Phoenician Baal in the stricter sense of the word, whose worship Jehu had exterminated from Israel, though not entirely, as is evident from the allusion to an Asherah in Samaria in the reign of Jehoahaz (<a href="/2_kings/13-6.htm">2 Kings 13:6</a>); but Baal is a general expression for all idols, including the golden calves, which are called other gods in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9</a>, and compared to actual idols. </body></html>
