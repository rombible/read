She believed that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and his threatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but by submitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahab proved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe the promises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressed by his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followers of him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, are cautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarlet cord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls to remembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ; and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justly offended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of these Israelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honour God with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our life for yours - See the margin.

As soon as the officers had left Rahab's house, she went to the spies, who were concealed upon the roof, before they had lain down to sleep, which they were probably about to do upon the roof, - a thing of frequent occurrence in the East in summer time, - and confessed to them all that she believed and knew, namely, that God had given the land to the Israelites, and that the dread of them had fallen upon the Canaanites ("us," in contrast with "you," the Israelites, signifies the Canaanites generally, and not merely the inhabitants of Jericho), and despair had seized upon all the inhabitants of the land. The description of the despair of the Canaanites (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>) is connected, so far as the expressions are concerned, with <a href="/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>, to show that what Moses and the Israelites had sung after crossing the Red Sea was now fulfilled, that the Lord had fulfilled His promise (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a> compared with <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>), and had put fear and dread upon the Canaanites.</body></html>
