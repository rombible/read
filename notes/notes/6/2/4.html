The providence of God directed the spies to the house of Rahab. God knew where there was one that would be true to them, though they did not. Rahab appears to have been an innkeeper; and if she had formerly been one of bad life, which is doubtful, she had left her evil courses. That which seems to us most accidental, is often overruled by the Divine providence to serve great ends. It was by faith that Rahab received those with peace, against whom her king and country had war. We are sure this was a good work; it is so spoken of by the apostle, Jas 2:25; and she did it by faith, such a faith as set her above the fear of man. Those only are true believers, who find in their hearts to venture for God; they take his people for their people, and cast in their lot among them. The spies were led by the special providence of God, and Rahab entertained them out of regard to Israel and Israel's God, and not for lucre or for any evil purpose. Though excuses may be offered for the guilt of Rahab's falsehood, it seems best to admit nothing which tends to explain it away. Her views of the Divine law must have been very dim: a falsehood like this, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, whatever the motive, would deserve heavy censure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I wist not whence they were - Rahab acted as she did from the belief in God's declared word, and conviction that resistance to His will would be both vain and wicked <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>. Thus, she manifested a faith both sound and practical, and is praised accordingly <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>; <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>.

For, as Calvin remarks, Rahab would hardly have dared to lie so coolly had she not previously taken precautions to conceal her guests. And therefore she must have told a twofold falsehood. She must have discovered, or been made acquainted with, their errand, and therefore have "known whence they were," in addition to her assertion that she did not know where they were now. <span class="cmt_word">And hid them.</span> The original is remarkable and very vivid. <span class="accented">And hid him, i.e.</span>, each one in a separate place.

In recalling this condition to the recollection of the tribes referred to, Joshua follows the expressions in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>, where Moses himself recapitulates his former command, rather than the original passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. The expression "this land" shows that the speaker was still on the other side of the Jordan. &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, with the loins girded, i.e., prepared for war, synonymous with &#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18</a> and <a href="/numbers/32-32.htm">Numbers 32:32</a> (see at <a href="/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>). &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;, all the mighty men of valour, i.e., the grave warriors (as in <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>, and very frequently in the later books), is not common to this book and Deuteronomy, as Knobel maintains, but is altogether strange to the Pentateuch. The word "all" (v. 14, like <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-21.htm">Numbers 32:21</a>, <a href="/numbers/32-27.htm">Numbers 32:27</a>) must not be pressed. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>, there were only about 40,000 men belonging to the two tribes and a half who crossed the Jordan to take part in the war; whereas, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-18.htm">Numbers 26:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-34.htm">Numbers 26:34</a>, there were 110,000 men in these tribes who were capable of bearing arms, so that 70,000 must have remained behind for the protection of the women and children and of the flocks and herds, and to defend the land of which they had taken possession. On <a href="/joshua/1-15.htm">Joshua 1:15</a> see <a href="/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18</a>; and on the more minute definition of "on this side (lit. beyond) Jordan" by "toward the sun-rising," compare the remarks on <a href="/numbers/32-19.htm">Numbers 32:19</a>. The answer of the two tribes and a half, in which they not only most cheerfully promise their help in the conquest of Canaan, but also express the wish that Joshua may have the help of the Lord (<a href="/joshua/1-17.htm">Joshua 1:17</a> compared with <a href="/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>), and after threatening all who refuse obedience with death, close with the divine admonition, "only be strong and of a good courage" (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-18.htm">Joshua 1:18</a>, cf. <a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>), furnishes a proof of the wish that inspired them to help their brethren, that all the tribes might speedily enter into the peaceable possession of the promised inheritance. The expression "rebel against the commandment" is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-26.htm">Deuteronomy 1:26</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-23.htm">Deuteronomy 9:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14</a>, to denote resistance to the commandments of the Lord; here it denotes opposition to His representative, the commander chosen by the Lord, which was to be punished with death, according to the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>. </body></html>
