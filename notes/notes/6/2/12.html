She believed that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and his threatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but by submitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahab proved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe the promises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressed by his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followers of him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, are cautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarlet cord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls to remembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ; and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justly offended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of these Israelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honour God with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A true token - literally, "a sign" or "pledge of truth; "something to bind them to keep their promise faithfully.

This, however, is not always the case (see <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>). "It had been an ill nature in Rahab if she had been content to be saved alone: that her love might be a match to her faith, she covenants for all her family, and so returns life to those of whom she received it," (Bp. Hall). <span class="cmt_word">A true token.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">a token of truth.</span> The construction is that in which the latter noun often stands in Hebrew for an adjective. Here, however, it would seem to be a little more, <span class="accented">a token of truth</span> - a pledge, that is, of sincerity. Rahab wanted some guarantee that her life and the lives of her kindred would be saved. The bare word of the spies would not suffice, for how could she and her kindred be identified in the confusion attending the sack of the city? But if the spies would agree upon some sign by which she could be recognised, it would at once be a pledge that they intended to keep their word, and a means of protection in the approaching downfall of the city. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the king of Jericho was informed of the fact that these strange men had entered the house of Rahab, and suspecting their reason for coming, summoned Rahab to give them up, she hid them (lit., hid him, i.e., each one of the spies: for this change from the plural to the singular see Ewald, 219), and said to the king's messengers: &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, recte, "It is quite correct, the men came to me, but I do not know where they were from; and when in the darkness the gate was at the shutting (i.e., ought to be shut: for this construction, see <a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>), they went out again, I know not whither. Pursue them quickly, you will certainly overtake them." The writer then adds this explanation in <a href="/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a> : she had hidden them upon the roof of her house among stalks of flax. The expression "to-night" (lit., the night) in <a href="/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a> is more precisely defined in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/2-5.htm">Joshua 2:5</a>, viz., as night was coming on, before the town-gate was shut, after which it would have been in vain for them to attempt to leave the town. "Stalks of flax," not "cotton pods" (Arab., J. D. Mich. ), or "tree-flax, i.e., cotton," as Thenius explains it, but flax stalks or stalk-flax, as distinguished from carded flax, in which there is no wood left, &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;, stipula lini (lxx, Vulg.). Flax stalks, which grow to the height of three or four feet in Egypt, and attain the thickness of a reed, and would probably be quite as large in the plain of Jericho, the climate of which resembles that of Egypt, would form a very good hiding-place for the spies if they were piled up upon the roof to dry in the sun. The falsehood by which Rahab sought not only to avert all suspicion from herself of any conspiracy with the Israelitish men who had entered her house, but to prevent any further search for them in her house, and to frustrate the attempt to arrest them, is not to be justified as a lie of necessity told for a good purpose, nor, as Grotius maintains, by the unfounded assertion that, "before the preaching of the gospel, a salutary lie was not regarded as a fault even by good men." Nor can it be shown that it was thought "allowable," or even "praiseworthy," simply because the writer mentions the fact without expressing any subjective opinion, or because, as we learn from what follows (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>.), Rahab was convinced of the truth of the miracles which God had wrought for His people, and acted in firm faith that the true God would give the land of Canaan to the Israelites, and that all opposition made to them would be vain, and would be, in fact, rebellion against the Almighty God himself. For a lie is always a sin. Therefore even if Rahab was not actuated at all by the desire to save herself and her family from destruction, and the motive from which she acted had its roots in her faith in the living God (<a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>), so that what she did for the spies, and thereby for the cause of the Lord, was counted to her for righteousness ("justified by works," <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>), yet the course which she adopted was a sin of weakness, which was forgiven her in mercy because of her faith.<p>(Note: Calvin's estimate is also a correct one: "It has often happened, that even when good men have endeavoured to keep a straight course, they have turned aside into circuitous paths. Rahab acted wrongly when she told a lie and said that the spies had gone; and the action was acceptable to God only because the evil that was mixed with the good was not imputed to her. Yet, although God wished the spies to be delivered, He did not sanction their being protected by a lie." Augustine also pronounces the same opinion concerning Rahab as that which he expressed concerning the Hebrew midwives (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>).) </body></html>
