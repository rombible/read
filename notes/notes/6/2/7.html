The providence of God directed the spies to the house of Rahab. God knew where there was one that would be true to them, though they did not. Rahab appears to have been an innkeeper; and if she had formerly been one of bad life, which is doubtful, she had left her evil courses. That which seems to us most accidental, is often overruled by the Divine providence to serve great ends. It was by faith that Rahab received those with peace, against whom her king and country had war. We are sure this was a good work; it is so spoken of by the apostle, Jas 2:25; and she did it by faith, such a faith as set her above the fear of man. Those only are true believers, who find in their hearts to venture for God; they take his people for their people, and cast in their lot among them. The spies were led by the special providence of God, and Rahab entertained them out of regard to Israel and Israel's God, and not for lucre or for any evil purpose. Though excuses may be offered for the guilt of Rahab's falsehood, it seems best to admit nothing which tends to explain it away. Her views of the Divine law must have been very dim: a falsehood like this, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, whatever the motive, would deserve heavy censure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense is, that "they pursued along the way which leads to Jordan and across the fords;" probably those described in <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords&#8212;That river is crossed at several well-known fords.

One near Jericho (cf, <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>; <a href="/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5, 6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-16.htm">2 Samuel 19:16, 19, 39</a>); one at Bethsean, now Beisan, leading to Succoth (<a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>. See Robinson, ' Biblical Researches' 2:497; Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine'); beside others not mentioned in Scripture. A vivid description of the crossing the Jordan at the fords near Jericho is to be found in Tristrain's 'Land of Israel,' p. 520. The ford is almost certainly the one mentioned here, since an hour or two's ride brought the party to Shittim. These fords were easy to cross save when the Jordan, as was now the case (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>), overflowed its banks. This may have been the reason why the pursuers did not cross the fords, but they pursued the spies to the fords, hoping to find their retreat cut off. This is rendered more probable by the fact (ver. 22) that the pursuers appear to have continued their search after leaving the fords. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Two Spies Sent Over to Jericho. - <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>. Although Joshua had received a promise from the Lord of His almighty help in the conquest of Canaan, he still thought it necessary to do what was requisite on his part to secure the success of the work committed to him, as the help of God does not preclude human action, but rather presupposes it. He therefore sent two men out secretly as spies from Shittim the place of encampment at that time (see at <a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>), to view, i.e., explore, the land, especially Jericho, the strongly fortified frontier town of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>). The word "secretly" is connected by the accents with "saying," giving them their instructions secretly; but this implies that they were also sent out secretly. This was done partly in order that the Canaanites might not hear of it, and partly in order that, if the report should prove unfavourable, the people might not be thrown into despair, as they had been before in the time of Moses. The spies proceeded to Jericho, and towards evening they entered the house of a harlot named Rahab, and lodged there, lit. laid themselves down, intended to remain or sleep there. Jericho was two hours' journey to the west of the Jordan, situated in a plain that was formerly very fertile, and celebrated for its palm trees and balsam shrubs, but which is now quite desolate and barren. This plain is encircled on the western side by a naked and barren range of mountains, which stretches as far as Beisan towards the north and to the Dead Sea on the south. Every trace of the town has long since passed away, though it evidently stood somewhere near, and probably on the northern side of, the miserable and dirty village of Rha, by the Wady Kelt (see Robinson, Pal. ii. pp. 279ff., 289ff.; v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 206ff.). Rahab is called a zonah, i.e., a harlot, not an innkeeper, as Josephus, the Chaldee version, and the Rabbins render the word. Their entering the house of such a person would not excite so much suspicion. Moreover, the situation of her house against or upon the town wall was one which facilitated escape. But the Lord so guided the course of the spies, that they found in this sinner the very person who was the most suitable for their purpose, and upon whose heart the tidings of the miracles wrought by the living God on behalf of Israel had made such an impression, that she not only informed the spies of the despondency of the Canaanites, but, with believing trust in the power of the God of Israel, concealed the spies from all the inquiries of her countrymen, though at the greatest risk to herself. </body></html>
