The providence of God directed the spies to the house of Rahab. God knew where there was one that would be true to them, though they did not. Rahab appears to have been an innkeeper; and if she had formerly been one of bad life, which is doubtful, she had left her evil courses. That which seems to us most accidental, is often overruled by the Divine providence to serve great ends. It was by faith that Rahab received those with peace, against whom her king and country had war. We are sure this was a good work; it is so spoken of by the apostle, Jas 2:25; and she did it by faith, such a faith as set her above the fear of man. Those only are true believers, who find in their hearts to venture for God; they take his people for their people, and cast in their lot among them. The spies were led by the special providence of God, and Rahab entertained them out of regard to Israel and Israel's God, and not for lucre or for any evil purpose. Though excuses may be offered for the guilt of Rahab's falsehood, it seems best to admit nothing which tends to explain it away. Her views of the Divine law must have been very dim: a falsehood like this, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, whatever the motive, would deserve heavy censure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stalks of flax - literally, "the carded fibres of the tree."

Before the messengers came; though Abarbinel thinks it was after they were gone, when she took them from the place of their concealment, and had them to the roof of the house, where she thought they would be safe and secure, should the messengers return, or others come in search of them, who would not, as she imagined, look for them there: <p>and hid them with the stalks of flax; that is, under them, or "in flax of wood", or "a tree" (b); which may with as much propriety, or more, be called a tree than hyssop, <a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>; as it is in the Misnah (c). Moreover, there was a sort of flax which grew in the upper part of Egypt towards Arabia, as Pliny says (d), which they called "xylon", or wood, of which were made "lina xylina": though the words may be rightly transposed, as by as, "stalks of flax", which are large and strong before the flax is stripped or beaten off of them; the Targum renders it bundles of flax, or handfuls and sheaves of them, as they were when cut down and gathered: <p>which she had laid in order upon the roof; to be dried, as Kimchi observes; and Pliny (e) speaks of flax being bound up in bundles, and hung up and dried in the sun; which was done that it might be more easily stripped and beaten off; and the roofs of houses in those countries being flat, were very fit for such a purpose; See Gill on <a href="/deuteronomy/22-8.htm">Deuteronomy 22:8</a>; and these being now laid there were very suitable and convenient to conceal the men under them.

In recalling this condition to the recollection of the tribes referred to, Joshua follows the expressions in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>, where Moses himself recapitulates his former command, rather than the original passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>.

The word "all" (v. 14, like <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-21.htm">Numbers 32:21</a>, <a href="/numbers/32-27.htm">Numbers 32:27</a>) must not be pressed. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>, there were only about 40,000 men belonging to the two tribes and a half who crossed the Jordan to take part in the war; whereas, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-18.htm">Numbers 26:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-34.htm">Numbers 26:34</a>, there were 110,000 men in these tribes who were capable of bearing arms, so that 70,000 must have remained behind for the protection of the women and children and of the flocks and herds, and to defend the land of which they had taken possession.
