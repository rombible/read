She believed that his promises would certainly be fulfilled, and his threatenings take effect; and that there was no way of escape but by submitting to him, and joining with his people. The conduct of Rahab proved that she had the real principle of Divine faith. Observe the promises the spies made to her. The goodness of God is often expressed by his kindness and truth, Ps 117:2; in both these we must be followers of him. Those who will be conscientious in keeping promises, are cautious in making them. The spies make needful conditions. The scarlet cord, like the blood upon the doorpost at the passover, recalls to remembrance the sinner's security under the atoning blood of Christ; and that we are to flee thereto for refuge from the wrath of a justly offended God. The same cord Rahab used for the saving of these Israelites, was to be used for her own safety. What we serve and honour God with, we may expect he will bless, and make useful to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense is, that "they pursued along the way which leads to Jordan and across the fords;" probably those described in <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 2:8-21.

Whether this name were known to her or not, she knew what was signified by it, the one only self-existent God (since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> is clearly derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to <span class="accented">be</span>), the Author of all things, visible and invisible (see ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">The Red Sea.</span> Brugsch, in his 'History of Egypt,' denies that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> should be rendered 'Red Sea,' and affirms that this error of the LXX. interpreters has been the source of endless misapprehensions. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> is an Egyptian word signifying flags or rushes, which abound not only in the Red Sea, but in the marshes on the shores of the Mediterranean, as, in fact, in all low-lying lands. It is here, according to Brugsch, in a treacherous and well-nigh impassable country, near that Serbonian bog, "where armies whole have sunk" (Milton, 'Paradise Lost,' Book H., line 594), that we are to look for the victorious passage of <span class="accented">Moses</span>, and the destruction of Pharaoh and his host. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> or rushes were to be found in the Nile, as <a href="/exodus/2-9.htm">Exodus 2:9, 5</a> shows (cf. <a href="/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>). So that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> by no means necessarily implies the Red Sea. Yet on the other hand we may remember, with the Edinburgh Reviewer (July, 1879), that the coastline of Palestine and of the delta of the Nile has undergone considerable changes during the historic period, and that the land has, during that period, largely encroached on the sea. <span class="cmt_word">Sihon and Og.</span> As we read in <a href="/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. and <a href="/deuteronomy/2.htm">Deuteronomy 2, 3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye utterly destroyed.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">devoted to utter destruction</span> (see <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>). Rahab seems to be aware that the extermination of these nations was in  fulfilment of a Divine sentence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the king of Jericho was informed of the fact that these strange men had entered the house of Rahab, and suspecting their reason for coming, summoned Rahab to give them up, she hid them (lit., hid him, i.e., each one of the spies: for this change from the plural to the singular see Ewald, 219), and said to the king's messengers: &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, recte, "It is quite correct, the men came to me, but I do not know where they were from; and when in the darkness the gate was at the shutting (i.e., ought to be shut: for this construction, see <a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>), they went out again, I know not whither. Pursue them quickly, you will certainly overtake them." The writer then adds this explanation in <a href="/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a> : she had hidden them upon the roof of her house among stalks of flax. The expression "to-night" (lit., the night) in <a href="/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a> is more precisely defined in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/2-5.htm">Joshua 2:5</a>, viz., as night was coming on, before the town-gate was shut, after which it would have been in vain for them to attempt to leave the town. "Stalks of flax," not "cotton pods" (Arab., J. D. Mich. ), or "tree-flax, i.e., cotton," as Thenius explains it, but flax stalks or stalk-flax, as distinguished from carded flax, in which there is no wood left, &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;, stipula lini (lxx, Vulg.). Flax stalks, which grow to the height of three or four feet in Egypt, and attain the thickness of a reed, and would probably be quite as large in the plain of Jericho, the climate of which resembles that of Egypt, would form a very good hiding-place for the spies if they were piled up upon the roof to dry in the sun. The falsehood by which Rahab sought not only to avert all suspicion from herself of any conspiracy with the Israelitish men who had entered her house, but to prevent any further search for them in her house, and to frustrate the attempt to arrest them, is not to be justified as a lie of necessity told for a good purpose, nor, as Grotius maintains, by the unfounded assertion that, "before the preaching of the gospel, a salutary lie was not regarded as a fault even by good men." Nor can it be shown that it was thought "allowable," or even "praiseworthy," simply because the writer mentions the fact without expressing any subjective opinion, or because, as we learn from what follows (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>.), Rahab was convinced of the truth of the miracles which God had wrought for His people, and acted in firm faith that the true God would give the land of Canaan to the Israelites, and that all opposition made to them would be vain, and would be, in fact, rebellion against the Almighty God himself. For a lie is always a sin. Therefore even if Rahab was not actuated at all by the desire to save herself and her family from destruction, and the motive from which she acted had its roots in her faith in the living God (<a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>), so that what she did for the spies, and thereby for the cause of the Lord, was counted to her for righteousness ("justified by works," <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>), yet the course which she adopted was a sin of weakness, which was forgiven her in mercy because of her faith.<p>(Note: Calvin's estimate is also a correct one: "It has often happened, that even when good men have endeavoured to keep a straight course, they have turned aside into circuitous paths. Rahab acted wrongly when she told a lie and said that the spies had gone; and the action was acceptable to God only because the evil that was mixed with the good was not imputed to her. Yet, although God wished the spies to be delivered, He did not sanction their being protected by a lie." Augustine also pronounces the same opinion concerning Rahab as that which he expressed concerning the Hebrew midwives (see the comm. on <a href="/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>).) </body></html>
