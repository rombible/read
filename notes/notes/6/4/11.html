Let none be weary of waiting, while they have the tokens of God's presence with them, even the ark of the covenant, though it be in the depths of adversity. Notice is taken of the honour put upon Joshua. Those are feared in the best manner, and to the best purpose, who make it appear that God is with them, and that they set him before them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another set of stones is intended than that before mentioned. The one set was erected by the command of God at the spot where they passed the night <a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3</a>; the other by Joshua on the spot where the priests' feet rested while they bore up the ark during the passage of the people. This spot was near, or perhaps on, the eastern brink (compare <a href="/joshua/3-8.htm">Joshua 3:8</a>). These stones would therefore mark the spot at which the people crossed, as the others marked the place in which they lodged the night after the crossing; nor, as the stones would only be reached by the water in flood time, and then by the utmost edge of it, is there any reason why they could not both be seen, and continue in their place as the writer asserts they did up to the time when he wrote. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the ark of the Lord passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people&#8212;The ark is mentioned as the efficient cause; it had been the first to move&#8212;it was the last to leave&#8212;and its movements arrested the deep attention of the people, who probably stood on the opposite bank, wrapt in admiration and awe of this closing scene.
