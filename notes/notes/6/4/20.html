The use of the first person in <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.">Joshua 5:1</a>, “until <span class= "ital">we </span>were passed over,” is most naturally explained by taking the verse as part of what the Israelites were to say to their children by the command of Joshua. The difficulty has been met in the Hebrew Bible by a Masoretic reading, in which “they” is substituted for “we.” But the more difficult reading is to be preferred. There is nothing else in the section that creates any difficulty. The twenty-third verse authorises a comparison between the passage of Jordan and the passage of the Red Sea. As the one is called a “baptising unto Moses,” in the <span class= "ital">New </span>Testament, we may call the other a baptising unto Joshua. (Comp. the “us” in <a href="/joshua/4-23.htm" title="For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:">Joshua 4:23</a>, with the “we” of <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.">Joshua 5:1</a>.) The first person also appears in <a href="/joshua/4-6.htm" title="That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean you by these stones?">Joshua 4:6</a>, “that he would give us.” It would appear that, besides explaining the erection of the <span class= "ital">stones, </span>the Israelites were also to explain to their children the meaning of Gilgal, the place where the stones were, and this explanation is not completed until the end of <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm" title="And Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.">Joshua 4:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/joshua/4-20.htm" title="And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.">Joshua 4:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">In Gilgal — </span>Probably in order, like so many little pillars, to keep up the remembrance of this miraculous benefit. Gilgal was situate between Jordan and Jericho, and, according to Josephus, was ten furlongs from the city, and fifty from the river. Joshua had his camp there during all the time that the war lasted, and till the division of the country among the tribes. There the Israelites were circumcised; there they celebrated the passover for the first time in the land of Canaan; and there the tabernacle was erected and fixed, till, Canaan being subdued, they placed it in Shiloh. Gilgal, however, always continued to be a place of importance, as we learn from divers passages of Scripture. See <a href="/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm" title="Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.">1 Samuel 11:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-12.htm" title="Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now on me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.">1 Samuel 13:12</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:20-24 It is the duty of parents to tell their children betimes of the words and works of God, that they may be trained up in the way they should go. In all the instruction parents give their children, they should teach them to fear God. Serious godliness is the best learning. Are we not called, as much as the Israelites, to praise the loving-kindness of our God? Shall we not raise a pillar to our God, who has brought us through dangers and distresses in so wonderful a way? For hitherto the Lord hath helped us, as much as he did his saints of old.

The site of the camp was no doubt fortified by Joshua, as it constituted for some time the abiding foothold in Canaan, from where he sallied forth to subdue the country. It was also the place of safety where the ark, and no doubt also the women, children, cattle, and other property of the people were left. Hence, the demolition of Jericho and Ai, strong fortresses in the neighborhood of Gilgal, was no doubt dictated by sound policy as well as by religious obligations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-24. those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal&#8212;Probably to render them more conspicuous, they might be raised on a foundation of earth or turf.

The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; do not imply that these 40,000 men crossed over behind the priests with the ark, which would not only be at variance with the fact so expressly stated, that the ark of the covenant was the medium of the miraculous division of the water, but also with the distant statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/4-18.htm">Joshua 4:18</a>, that when the priests, with the ark, set their feet upon the dry land, the waters filled the river again as they had done before.

"Arboth Jericho," the steppes of Jericho, were that portion of the Arabah or Ghor which formed the environs of Jericho, and which widens here into a low-lying plain of about three and a half or four hours' journey in breadth, on account of the western mountains receding considerably to the south of the opening of the Wady Kelt (Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 263ff.). - In <a href="/joshua/4-14.htm">Joshua 4:14</a> the writer mentions still further the fact that the Lord fulfilled His promise (in <a href="/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>), and by means of this miracle so effectually confirmed the authority of Joshua in the eyes of Israel, that the people feared him all the days of his life as they had feared Moses. "This was not the chief end of the miracle, that Joshua increased in power and authority; but since it was a matter of great importance, so far as the public interests were concerned, that the government of Joshua should be established, it is very properly mentioned, as an addition to the benefits that were otherwise conferred, that he was invested as it were with sacred insignia, which produced such a felling of veneration among the people, that no one dared to treat him with disrespect" (Calvin). </body></html>
