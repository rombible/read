It is the pious conjecture of the learned Bishop Patrick, that Joshua was gone into some place of retirement, to return thanks immediately for this wonderful mercy; and then God met him and spake thus to him. Or, perhaps, it was by Eleazar the priest that God gave these and other instructions to Joshua; for though he is not mentioned here, yet, when Joshua was ordained by the imposition of hands to this great trust, God appointed that Eleazar should ask <span class="ital">counsel for him, after the judgment of Urim; and at his word Joshua and all the children of Israel were to go out and come in, </span><a href="/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-9 The works of the Lord are so worthy of rememberance, and the heart of man is so prone to forget them, that various methods are needful to refresh our memories, for the glory of God, our advantage, and that of our children.

The solemn inauguration of Joshua to his office, and his miraculous attestation, by the same waters with which Jesus was baptized on entering on the public exercise of His ministry (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>); the choice of twelve men, one from each tribe to be the bearers of the twelve stones, and the builders of the monument erected therewith (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>): these were divinely-ordered occurrences, not without a further bearing than their more immediate one upon Israel. Nor must in this point of view the name "Adam," the place where the stream flowed to the people which cut them off from the promises, and the failure for the time under the rule of Joshua of the full and rapid flood which supplies the Dead Sea, be overlooked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>Jos 4:1-8.

For what purpose is not stated here, but is apparent from what follows (<a href="/joshua/4-2.htm">Joshua 4:2</a>.). The choice or appointment of these men was necessarily commanded before the crossing commenced, as they were to stand by the side of Joshua, or near the bearers of the ark of the covenant, so as to be at hand to perform the duty to be entrusted to them (<a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3</a>.). Joshua then concludes by foretelling the miracle itself: "It will come to pass, that when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord shall settle down in the water of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off; namely, the waters flowing down from above, and shall stand still as one heap." "Shall be cut off," so as to disappear; namely, at the place where the priests stand with the ark of the covenant. This took place through the waters standing still as a heap, or being heaped up, at some distance above the standing-place. &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1504;&#1491; is an accusative of more precise definition. The expression is taken from the song of Moses (<a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>). </body></html>
