They had been previously chosen for this service (Jos 3:12), and the repetition of the command is made here solely to introduce the account of its execution. Though Joshua had been divinely instructed to erect a commemorative pile, the representatives were not apprised of the work they were to do till the time of the passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For the greater evidence and certainty, and the more effectual spreading of the report of this marvellous work among all the tribes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Take you twelve men out of the people,.... Joshua had before this ordered twelve men to be taken from among them, which seems to have been done of himself; and now he has a direction from God for it, and what to employ them in: <p>out of every tribe a man; so that what they did was in the name of the several tribes, and as representing them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twelve stones.</span> The commemoration of events by the setting up of huge stones was by no means peculiar to the Jews, though it was often used by them, as, for instance, <a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>, 35:14, <a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>. Almost every nation has adopted it. The Egyptian obelisks, the stones at Hamath, supposed to be of Hittite origin, the dolmens and other megalithic monuments of the Celts, the Logan or rocking stones, are cases in point. The Scandinavians filled their country with them. Our own Stonehenge and the Avebury stones are supposed by some to be, not temples nor burial places, but memorials of some battle. The command here given to Joshua was regarding what was to be done by the twelve men, who (Joshua 5:4; cf. ch. Joshua 3:12) were already chosen. The form of the command is merely another instance of the common Hebrew practice of repetition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And take to you (i.e., appoint) twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one for each tribe." For what purpose is not stated here, but is apparent from what follows (<a href="/joshua/4-2.htm">Joshua 4:2</a>.). The choice or appointment of these men was necessarily commanded before the crossing commenced, as they were to stand by the side of Joshua, or near the bearers of the ark of the covenant, so as to be at hand to perform the duty to be entrusted to them (<a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3</a>.). Joshua then concludes by foretelling the miracle itself: "It will come to pass, that when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord shall settle down in the water of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off; namely, the waters flowing down from above, and shall stand still as one heap." "Shall be cut off," so as to disappear; namely, at the place where the priests stand with the ark of the covenant. This took place through the waters standing still as a heap, or being heaped up, at some distance above the standing-place. &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1504;&#1491; is an accusative of more precise definition. The expression is taken from the song of Moses (<a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>). </body></html>
