The statement that on the removal of the ark the waters of Jordan at once returned to their former level <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/4-18.htm">Joshua 4:18</a>, heightens the impression which is especially inculcated throughout - that the whole transaction was extraordinary and miraculous. The details and incidents of the passage are no doubt open to manifold discussion: but all such discussion will be futile unless it proceed throughout on the admission that we have here before us the record of a distinctly supernatural interposition: compare the introduction to the Book of Joshua. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark &#8230; were come out of the midst of Jordan &#8230; that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place&#8212;Their crossing, which was the final act, completed the evidence of the miracle; for then, and not till then, the suspended laws of nature were restored, the waters returned to their place, and the river flowed with as full a current as before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The waters</span> came down from their heaps, and returned with all convenient speed into their proper channel, according to their natural and usual course. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan,....

The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; do not imply that these 40,000 men crossed over behind the priests with the ark, which would not only be at variance with the fact so expressly stated, that the ark of the covenant was the medium of the miraculous division of the water, but also with the distant statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/4-18.htm">Joshua 4:18</a>, that when the priests, with the ark, set their feet upon the dry land, the waters filled the river again as they had done before. The imperfect with vav consec. here expresses simply the order of thought, and not of time. "Arboth Jericho," the steppes of Jericho, were that portion of the Arabah or Ghor which formed the environs of Jericho, and which widens here into a low-lying plain of about three and a half or four hours' journey in breadth, on account of the western mountains receding considerably to the south of the opening of the Wady Kelt (Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 263ff.). - In <a href="/joshua/4-14.htm">Joshua 4:14</a> the writer mentions still further the fact that the Lord fulfilled His promise (in <a href="/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>), and by means of this miracle so effectually confirmed the authority of Joshua in the eyes of Israel, that the people feared him all the days of his life as they had feared Moses. "This was not the chief end of the miracle, that Joshua increased in power and authority; but since it was a matter of great importance, so far as the public interests were concerned, that the government of Joshua should be established, it is very properly mentioned, as an addition to the benefits that were otherwise conferred, that he was invested as it were with sacred insignia, which produced such a felling of veneration among the people, that no one dared to treat him with disrespect" (Calvin). </body></html>
