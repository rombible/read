Had Joshua given orders to prepare for erecting this memorial of himself, it might have looked like a design to perpetuate his own name and honour; but as it was done by the divine direction, it could be viewed in no other light than as a monument raised to the honour and glory of God, who hath “so done his marvellous works, that they ought to be had in everlasting remembrance,” and means devised to preserve among men the memory of them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-9 The works of the Lord are so worthy of rememberance, and the heart of man is so prone to forget them, that various methods are needful to refresh our memories, for the glory of God, our advantage, and that of our children.

That this may be a sign among you&#8212;The erection of cairns, or huge piles of stones, as monuments of remarkable incidents has been common among all people, especially in the early and rude periods of their history. They are the established means of perpetuating the memory of important transactions, especially among the nomadic people of the East. Although there be no inscription engraved on them, the history and object of such simple monuments are traditionally preserved from age to age. Similar was the purpose contemplated by the conveyance of the twelve stones to Gilgal: it was that they might be a standing record to posterity of the miraculous passage of the Jordan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A sign; a monument or memorial of this day’s work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That this may be a sign among you,....

The passover, the law itself, as well as certain outward and visible memorials, were to be the guarantees to future ages of the truth of the history related in the Books of Hoses and Joshua. The monument has disappeared, but the observance of the passover and the whole law by the Jews now, more than 3,000 years after the events related in these books, is a perpetual standing witness of the truth of the record. In like manner the Christian passover, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is appealed to by Christians of every denomination as a proof of the substantial truth of the narrative of the Gospels. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the priests stood with the ark of the covenant "in the midst of Jordan," i.e., in the bed of the river, not merely by the river, "upon dry ground, &#1492;&#1499;&#1503;," lit., firmando, i.e., with a firm foot, whilst all Israel went over upon dry ground, "till all the people were passed over."
