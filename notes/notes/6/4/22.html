In all the instruction parents give their children, they should teach them to fear God. Serious godliness is the best learning. Are we not called, as much as the Israelites, to praise the loving-kindness of our God? Shall we not raise a pillar to our God, who has brought us through dangers and distresses in so wonderful a way? For hitherto the Lord hath helped us, as much as he did his saints of old.

The site of the camp was no doubt fortified by Joshua, as it constituted for some time the abiding foothold in Canaan, from where he sallied forth to subdue the country. It was also the place of safety where the ark, and no doubt also the women, children, cattle, and other property of the people were left. Hence, the demolition of Jericho and Ai, strong fortresses in the neighborhood of Gilgal, was no doubt dictated by sound policy as well as by religious obligations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-24. those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal&#8212;Probably to render them more conspicuous, they might be raised on a foundation of earth or turf. The pile was designed to serve a double purpose&#8212;that of impressing the heathen with a sense of the omnipotence of God, while at the same time it would teach an important lesson in religion to the young and rising Israelites in after ages.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then ye shall let your children know,....
