None of their conduct can be drawn into an example for others. Especial reason no doubt there was for this severity to the king of Ai; it is likely he had been notoriously wicked and vile, and a blasphemer of the God of Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No doubt Joshua had ascended the heights, most likely those to the north of the valley, so as to separate himself from the flying Israelites on the lower ground, and to be visible to the men in ambush behind the city. He now, at the command of God, gives the appointed signal to the ambush. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua&#8212;to be reserved for a more ignominious death, as a greater criminal in God's sight than his subjects.

It is evident from <a href="/joshua/8-17.htm">Joshua 8:17</a> that the inhabitants of Bethel, which was about three hours' journey from Ai, took part in the battle, probably in consequence of a treaty which the king of Ai had made with them in the expectation of a renewed and still stronger attack on the part of the Israelites. Nothing further is known upon this point; nor can anything be inferred from the fact that the king of Bethel is included in the list of the kings slain by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/12-16.htm">Joshua 12:16</a>). Consequently, we cannot decide whether the Bethelites came to the help of the Aites for the first time on the day of the battle itself, or, what is more probable, had already sent men to Ai, to help to repulse the expected attack of the Israelites upon that town.</body></html>
