The road past Beth-el to Ai had been left open. It passes the north end of the two ravines in which Joshua’s ambush was posted. At the same time, it would have been easy to conceal a chain of sentinels that could observe it and tell the 35,000 men in ambush what was going on, so that if any attempt had been made by the men of Beth-el to protect Ai, it could easily have been frustrated. But no one suspected any danger, and therefore no such attempt was made. The men of Beth-el and Ai took the road that was left open to them and pursued the Israelites, probably down the ancient way past Michmash towards the Shebarim, leaving Beth-el and Ai both unprotected. After they had gone some distance, about a mile or a mile and a half from Ai, this road would bring them past the lower end of the ravine in which the ambush was posted. A second chain of outposts would easily take the signal from Joshua when this point had been passed, and then all was over with the town of Ai.<p>It is curious that we do not hear of the capture of Beth-el at this time, though it would have been perfectly easy to take it. The king of Beth-el is named in the list of those whom Joshua smote (<a href="/joshua/12-16.htm" title="The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;">Joshua 12:16</a>). We read of its capture in <a href="/judges/1-22.htm" title="And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.">Judges 1:22</a>, and of the “entrance into the city” being sought for and betrayed.

Those that would maintain their spiritual conflicts must not love their ease. Probably he went into the valley alone, to pray to God for a blessing, and he did not seek in vain.

Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them&#8212;the pretended flight in the direction of the wilderness; that is, southeast, into the Ghor, the desert valley of the Jordan, decoyed all the inhabitants of Ai out of the city, while the people of Beth-el hastened to participate in the expected victory. It is supposed by some, from "the city," and not "cities," being spoken of, that the effective force of Beth-el had been concentrated in Ai, as the two places were closely contiguous, and Ai the larger of the two. (See Jos 12:9). It may be remarked, however, that the words, "or Beth-el," are not in the Septuagint, and are rejected by some eminent scholars, as an interpolation not found in the most ancient manuscripts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Not a man, </span> to wit, fit for war. <span class="ital">Beth-el</span>, being a neighbouring city, and encouraged by the former success, had sent some forces to assist them; and now, upon notice sent to them of the flight of their common enemies, or upon some other signal given, which might easily be done, having been appointed beforehand, as is usual in such cases, all their men of war join with those of Ai in the pursuit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel that went not out after Israel,.... For as these two places were very near to each other, but a mile apart, they were in confederacy, and acted together, and could easily be called to the help of each other when required: though there is a difficulty how the men of Bethel could join those of Ai, when the ambush lay between them both, <a href="/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>; they either went another way, or the ambush purposely let them pass, for fear of a discovery by a skirmish with them, and that Bethel as well as Ai might be cleared of its armed inhabitants, and so fall an easy prey to them as well as Ai: this must be understood only of men of war; for otherwise there were inhabitants left, as old men, and such as were unfit for war, afterwards slain, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-24.htm">Joshua 8:24</a>, <p>and they left the city open: they did not stay to shut the gates, nor left porters or any guards about, to take care of, protect, and defend the city: <p>and pursued after Israel; with great eagerness and vehemence, not having the least apprehension of their city being in any danger. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">or Beth-el</span>] The inhabitants of Bethel would seem on this occasion to have sent help to the people of Ai in resisting the attack of Joshua.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or Bethel.</span> These words are not in the LXX., and they may possibly have been a marginal gloss, for the intervention of the people of Bethel in this battle is very unintelligible. See note on Joshua 7:2. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the difficulty involved in their retention may have caused their omission from the LXX., and it may perhaps be thought possible that, on the capture of Ai, the Bethelites returned with all speed to their city, and that Joshua postponed its capture in consequence of the formidable confederacy (<a href="/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1, 2</a>), which his success had called into existence, or, perhaps, by a desire to signalise at once the victory at Ai by the ceremony (vers. 30-35) at Gerizim. We read in <a href="/joshua/12-16.htm">Joshua 12:16</a> that Bethel was taken. In <a href="/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22</a> we read that it was not (see note on Joshua 12:16). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The whole of the people of war also advanced with him to the front of the town, and encamped on the north of Ai, so that the valley was between it (&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, as in <a href="/joshua/3-4.htm">Joshua 3:4</a>) and Ai. This was probably a side valley branching off towards the south from the eastern continuation of the Wady es Suweinit. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>, the account of the preparations for the attack is founded off by a repetition of the notice as to the forces engaged, and in some respects a more exact description of their disposition. Joshua, it is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, took about 5000 men and placed them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the town. As the place where this ambuscade was posted is described in precisely the same terms as that which was occupied, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-9.htm">Joshua 8:9</a>, by the 30,000 men who were sent out to form an ambuscade in the night before the advance of the main army against Ai (for the substitution of "the city" for Ai cannot possibly indicate a difference in the locality), the view held by the majority of commentators, that <a href="/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a> refers to a second ambuscade, which Joshua sent out in addition to the 30,000, and posted by the side of them, is even more than questionable, and is by no means raised into a probability by the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1493; (Eng. "their liers in wait") in <a href="/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>. The description of the place, "on the west of the city," leaves no doubt whatever that "their liers in wait" are simply the ambuscade (&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;) mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, which was sent out from the whole army, i.e., the ambuscade that was posted on the west of the town. &#1506;&#1511;&#1489; signifies literally the lier in wait (<a href="/psalms/49-5.htm">Psalm 49:5</a>), from &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, insidiari, and is synonymous with &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;. The meaning which Gesenius and others attach to the word, viz., the rear or hinder part of the army, cannot be sustained from <a href="/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>. If we add to this the fact that <a href="/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a> is obviously nothing more than a repetition of the description already given in <a href="/joshua/8-11.htm">Joshua 8:11</a> of the place where the main army was posted, and therefore bears the character of a closing remark introduced to wind up the previous account, we cannot regard <a href="/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a> as anything more than a repetition of the statements in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-9.htm">Joshua 8:9</a>, and can only explain the discrepancy with regard to the number of men who were placed in ambush, by supposing that, through a copyist's error, the number which was expressed at first in simple letters has in one instance been given wrongly. The mistake, however, is not to be found in the 5000 (<a href="/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>), but in the 30,000 in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, where &#1492; has been confounded with &#1500;. For a detachment of 5000 men would be quite sufficient for an ambuscade that had only to enter the town after the soldiers had left it in pursuit of the Israelites, and to set it on fire, whereas it hardly seems possible that 30,000 men should have been posted in ambush so near to the town.<p>(Note: We need have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that there is a mistake in the number given in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, as the occurrence of such mistakes in the historical books is fully established by a comparison of the numbers given in the books of Samuel and Kings with those in the books of Chronicles, and is admitted by every commentator. In my earlier commentary on Joshua, I attempted to solve the difficulty by the twofold assumption: first, that <a href="/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a> contains a supplementary statement, in which the number of the men posted in ambush is given for the firs time; and secondly, that the historian forgot to notice that out of the 30,000 men whom Joshua chose to make war upon Ai, 5000 were set apart to lie in ambush. But, on further examination of the text, I have come to the conclusion that the second assumption is irreconcilable with the distinct words of <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>, and feel obliged to give it up. On the other hand, I still adhere to the conviction that there is not sufficient ground either for the assumption that <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>, contain an old marginal gloss that has crept into the text, or for the hypothesis of Ewald and Knobel, that these verses were introduced by the last editor of the book out of some other document. The last hypothesis amounts to a charge of thoughtlessness against the latest editor, which is hardly reconcilable with the endeavour, for which he is praised in other places, to reconcile the discrepancies in the different documents.)<p> - In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm">Joshua 8:13</a>, &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (the people) is to be taken as the subject of the sentence: "The people had set all the host, that was on the north of the city, and its ambuscade on the west of the city." In the night, namely the night before the army arrived at the north of the town, Joshua went through the midst of the valley, which separated the Israelites from the town, so that in the morning he stood with all the army close before the town.</body></html>
