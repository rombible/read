Those that would maintain their spiritual conflicts must not love their ease. Probably he went into the valley alone, to pray to God for a blessing, and he did not seek in vain. He never drew back till the work was done. Those that have stretched out their hands against their spiritual enemies, must never draw them back.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No doubt Joshua had ascended the heights, most likely those to the north of the valley, so as to separate himself from the flying Israelites on the lower ground, and to be visible to the men in ambush behind the city.

Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city&#8212;The uplifted spear had probably a flag, or streamer on it, to render it the more conspicuous from the height where he stood. At the sight of this understood signal the ambush nearest the city, informed by their scouts, made a sudden rush and took possession of the city, telegraphing to their brethren by raising a smoke from the walls. Upon seeing this, the main body, who had been reigning a flight, turned round at the head of the pass upon their pursuers, while the twenty-five thousand issuing from their ambuscade, fell back upon their rear. The Ai-ites surprised, looked back, and found their situation now desperate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">No power, </span> or, <span class="ital">place</span>; for so the Hebrew word is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/2-17.htm" title="Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camp: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards.">Numbers 2:17</a> <a href="/nehemiah/7-4.htm" title="Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.">Nehemiah 7:4</a> <a href="/job/37-7.htm" title="He seals up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.">Job 37:7</a> <a href="/psalms/104-25.htm" title="So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.">Psalm 104:25</a> <a href="/isaiah/22-18.htm" title="He will surely violently turn and toss you like a ball into a large country: there shall you die, and there the chariots of your glory shall be the shame of your lord's house.">Isaiah 22:18</a> 56:5</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the men of Ai looked behind them,....
