27. We must not think to defer covenanting with God till we are settled in the world; nor must any business put us from minding and pursuing the one thing needful. The way to prosper is to begin with God, Mt 6:33. They built an altar, and offered sacrifice to God, in token of their dedicating themselves to God, as living sacrifices to his honour, in and by a Mediator. By Christ's sacrifice of himself for us, we have peace with God. It is a great mercy to any people to have the law of God in writing, and it is fit that the written law should be in a known tongue, that it may be seen and read of all men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the note marginal reference.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side&#8212;One half of Israel was arranged on Gerizim, and the other half on Ebal&#8212;along the sides and base of each.<p>before the priests the Levites&#8212;in full view of them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All Israel, </span> i.e. the whole congregation, old and young, male and female, as it follows, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/8-35.htm" title="There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.">Joshua 8:35</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On this side the ark, and on that side, </span> i.e. some on one side of it, and some on the other.

The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span> is used very loosely in Hebrew (see <a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>). We need not, therefore, assume as a matter of course that the whole people, men, women, and children, were taken up to Shechem to behold this ceremony. It is quite possible that during all Joshua's marches and campaigns a large number of the people remained under guard at Gilgal (see <a href="/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>), which remained the headquarters of the Israelites until the country was subdued. All that is here meant is that a very great number of the people were gathered together, and that every tribe, every age, and each sex were largely represented at this important ceremony. <span class="cmt_word">And officers.</span> Shoterim (see <a href="/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Half of them.</span> Origen's explanation of the spiritual meaning of this passage is noteworthy, even though somewhat farfetched. He regards those of the tribes who stood on Mount Gerizim to bless, as the type of those who are led, not by fear of God's threatenings, but by a longing for God's promises and blessings; those who stood on Mount Ebal to curse, as the type of those who are driven by the fear of punishment to obey the will of God, and these finally attain salvation. The former, he adds, are the more noble of the two; but Jesus, who reads the hearts, gives each their proper station, and places some on Mount Ebal to curse, not that they themselves may receive the curse, but, by regarding the curse pronounced on sinners, may learn thereby how to escape it. <span class="cmt_word">Over against.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> rather, "in the direction off" The command in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> is that they shall stand upon the two mountains. No doubt certain representatives of the tribes stood on the mountain, and the rest of the people at the foot of the mountain, on either side of the valley, "crowding the slopes," as Canon Tristram says. The valley is narrow here, and the voice in mountainous regions, where the air is rarer, carries far. Under special circumstances, such as frosty weather, the voices of men crying their wares have been distinctly heard across the Humber in our own country. And in mountain passes, as any one who has travelled in them may easily ascertain, conversations may be carried on from opposite sides of a valley or ravine without the slightest difficulty. In this particular place Canon Tristram tell us ('Land of Israel,' pp. 149, 150) that when on Mount Gerizim he heard every word uttered by a man who was then driving his ass down Mount Ebal, and that afterwards two of his party recited the commandments antiphonally from the two sides of the valley without the least difficulty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Only the cattle and the rest of the booty the conquerors retained for themselves, according to the word of the Lord (<a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>).</body></html>
