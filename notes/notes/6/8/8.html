"Surely," he says, "wars are not carried on by striking alone; but they are considered the best generals who succeed through art and counsel more than by force ... . Therefore, if war is lawful at all, it is beyond all controversy that the way is perfectly clear for the use of the customary arts of warfare, provided there is no breach of faith in the violation of treaty or truce, or in any other way.")<p>&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;, a collective noun, signifying the persons concealed in ambush; &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489; (<a href="/joshua/8-9.htm">Joshua 8:9</a>), the place of ambush.
