It explains why the captain of the Lord's host appeared unto Joshua. The inhabitants of Jericho, though in a state of the utmost alarm, were nevertheless fully on their guard against the children of Israel. The commencement of hostilities imposed a great responsibility on Joshua. Success at the outset was, humanly speaking, indispensable. We may see what defeat involved for him by his distress in consequence of the check at Ai. The alternative was victory or annihilation, for the Israelites had no homes or fortresses to which they could retire. Joshua was therefore encouraged by a visible proof that he was under the protection of the Most High, to be yet farther assured by the marvels that were to follow. The use of the Pual participle with its fullest intensive sense, to strengthen the affirmation of the action by the Kal, is a singular construction. Literally rendered it is "shutting and closely shut up," thus including <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the act of closing, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the continuance of that act, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> (LXX.), "clausa at que munita" (Vulg.). So also the Chaldea paraphrase. The remainder of the verse strengthens still more the assertion of the state of siege. The king of Jericho, such was his alarm, regarded his city as a beleaguered one, from the mere presence of Joshua and his host in its vicinity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Passover at Gilgal. - When the whole nation had been received again into covenant with the Lord by circumcision, they kept the passover, which had no doubt been suspended from the time that they left Sinai (<a href="/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1</a>.), on the 14th of the month (Nisan), in the evening (according to the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-6.htm">Deuteronomy 16:6</a>). The next day, i.e., on the 16th, or the day after the first feast-day, they ate unleavened loaves and parched corn ("roasted grains," see at <a href="/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>) of the produce of the land (&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <p>(Note: Rendered "old corn" in the Eng. version.)<p>which only occurs in <a href="/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>, is synonymous with &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;<p>(Note: Rendered fruit in our version.)<p>in <a href="/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>), i.e., corn that had grown in the land of Canaan, as the manna entirely ceased from this day forwards. "The morrow after the passover" is used in <a href="/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3</a> for the 15th Nisan; but here it must be understood as signifying the 16th, as the produce of the land, of which they ate not only on that day, but, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>, throughout that year, cannot mean the corn of the previous year, but the produce of this same year, i.e., the new corn, and they were not allowed to eat any of that till it had been sanctified to the Lord by the presentation of the wave sheaf on the second day of the passover (<a href="/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>, the presentation was to take place on the day after the Sabbath, i.e., the first day of the feast of Mazzoth, which was kept as a Sabbath, or the 16th of Nisan, as the seven days' feast of Mazzoth commenced on the 15th (<a href="/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17</a>). "On the morrow after the passover" is the same as "on the morrow after the Sabbath" in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>, the term passover being used here not in its original and more restricted sense, in which it applies exclusively to the observance of the paschal meal, which took place on the evening of the 14th, and is expressly distinguished from the seven days' feast of Mazzoth (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-27.htm">Exodus 12:27</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16</a>), but in the broader sense, which we have already met with in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>, in which the name was gradually extended to the whole of the seven days' feast. The writer assumed that the facts themselves were already well known from the Mosaic law, and therefore did not think it necessary to give any fuller explanation. Moreover, the words, "they did eat of the fruit of the land," etc., are not to be understood as signifying that they began to eat unleavened bread for the first time on the 16th Nisan (they had already eaten is as an accompaniment to the paschal lamb); but unleavened bread of the produce of the land, the green corn of that year, was what they ate for the first time on that day. Especial prominence is given to this by the words, "in the self-same day," because not only did the eating of the new corn commence on that day, but from that day forward "the children of Israel had manna no more." This statement is evidently related to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>, and must be understood, according to that passage, as merely signifying, that on that day the gift of the manna entirely ceased (see Pentateuch, pp. 366ff.). </body></html>
