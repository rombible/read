So He appoints, from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, as sinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them that believed not, Heb 11:31. All her kindred were saved with her; thus faith in Christ brings salvation to the house, Ac 14:31. She, and they with her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or with the men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses or disregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh by love. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us choose accordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it rests there is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Adjured - i. e. put an oath upon them; or, perhaps, actually caused them themselves to take an oath (compare <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>). The words of the oath have in the original a rhythmical character which would tend to keep them on the lips and in the memory of the people.<p>Buildeth this city - i. e. rebuilds the fortifications. Jericho was at once occupied by the Benjamites. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>, and the natural advantages of the situation were such that it would not be likely to be left long desolate. Joshua speaks in the text as a warrior. He lays a ban on the re-erection of those lofty walls which had bidden defiance to God's host, and been by God's signal interposition overthrown. Hiel, the Bethelite, reckless of the prophecy recorded in our text, began and completed the circumvallation of the city a second time (see the marginal reference). Hiel did not found a new city but only fortified an existing one.<p>He shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born - i. e. when he begins this work his eldest son shall die, when he completes it his youngest shall die (see <a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a> note).<p>This chapter read in the light of the New Testament has indications of a further import and bearing than such as concerned Joshua and the Jews. As Joshua, the leader and captain of the Jewish theocracy, is a type of Christ, so is Jericho to be taken (with all Christian expositors) as a type of the powers opposed to Christ and His cause. The times which prepare for the close of God's present dispensation are signified in the days during which the people obeyed and waited; as the number of those days, seven, the number of perfection, represents that "fullness of time," known only to God, at which His dispensation will culminate and close. Thus the circumstances which lead up to the fall of Jericho are an acted prophecy, as was that fall itself, which sets forth the overthrow of all that resists the kingdom of which Christ is the head; and particularly the day of judgment, in which that overthrow will be fully and finally accomplished. Paul, in describing that day, seems to borrow his imagery from this chapter (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 6:26, 27. The Rebuilder of Jericho Cursed.<p>26. Joshua adjured them at that time&#8212;that is, imposed upon his countrymen a solemn oath, binding on themselves as well as their posterity, that they would never rebuild that city. Its destruction was designed by God to be a permanent memorial of His abhorrence of idolatry and its attendant vices.<p>Cursed be the man &#8230; that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho&#8212;that is, makes the daring attempt to build.<p>he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it&#8212;shall become childless&#8212;the first beginning being marked by the death of his oldest son, and his only surviving child dying at the time of its completion.

"All that she had" does not mean all her possessions, but all the persons belonging to her house; and "all her kindred" are all her relations by birth or marriage, with their dependants (cf. <a href="/joshua/2-13.htm">Joshua 2:13</a>). Clericus is correct in observing, that as Rahab's house was built against the town-wall, and rested partly upon it (<a href="/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>), when the wall fell down, that portion against or upon which the house stood cannot have fallen along with the rest, "otherwise when the wall fell no one would have dared to remain in the house." But we must not draw the further inference, that when the town was burned Rahab's house was spared.<p>(Note: The statements made by travellers in the middle ages, to the effect that they had seen Rahab's house (Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 295-6), belong to the delusions of pious superstition.)<p>&#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="/joshua/6-23.htm">Joshua 6:23</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/19-16.htm">Genesis 19:16</a>), "they let them rest," i.e., placed them in safety, "outside the camp of Israel," sc., till they had done all that was requisite for a formal reception into the congregation of the Lord, viz., by giving up idolatry and heathen superstition, and turning to the God of Israel as the only true God (to which circumcision had to be added in the case of the men), and by whatever lustrations and purifications were customary at the time in connection with reception into the covenant with Jehovah, of which we have no further information.</body></html>
