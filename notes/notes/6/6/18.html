So He appoints, from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, as sinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them that believed not, Heb 11:31. All her kindred were saved with her; thus faith in Christ brings salvation to the house, Ac 14:31. She, and they with her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or with the men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses or disregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh by love. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us choose accordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it rests there is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Accursed - Better as in margin, ("devoted" (<a href="/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a> note). In other cases the inhabitants only of the towns were slain; their cattle and property became the booty of the victors. But Jericho, as the first Canaanite city that was captured, was devoted by Israel as first-fruits to God, as a token that Israel received all the land from Him. Every living thing was put to death (Rahab and her household excepted) as a sacrifice to God, and the indestructible goods were <a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a> brought into the treasury of the sanctuary. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. and ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing&#8212;Generally they were at liberty to take the spoil of other cities that were captured (De 2:35; 3:7; Jos 8:27). But this, as the first fruits of Canaan, was made an exception; nothing was to be spared but Rahab and those in her house [Jos 6:17]. A violation of these stringent orders would not only render the guilty persons obnoxious to the curse, but entail distress and adversity upon all Israel, by provoking the divine displeasure. These were the instructions given, or repeated (De 13:17; 7:26), previous to the last act of the siege.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Make the camp of Israel a curse, </span> by provoking God to punish them for your sin, in which they may be one way or other involved; or at least upon the occasion of your sin: for, to speak properly God will not (the case of Adam’s sin only excepted) punish one man for the sin of another, as he hath oft declared; but the whole camp having sins of their own, God might take what occasion he saw fit to inflict this punishment. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And you in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,....
