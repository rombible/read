He intimates that he does not utter this of himself, or in consequence of any particular dislike of that place; but from Jehovah, and by divine inspiration. God would have the ruins of this city remain as a standing monument of his justice against this wicked and idolatrous people, and of his almighty power in destroying so great and strong a city by such contemptible means. Thus Maimonides, the Jewish rabbi: “Joshua pronounced a curse against those who should build up Jericho, that the remembrance of the miracle which God had wrought by destroying it might never be effaced; for all who looked on these ruins, thus sunk into the earth,” (he thought the walls were swallowed up rather than overthrown,) “clearly saw them to be the ruins of a city destroyed by a miracle, and not by the hand of men.” <span class="ital">Cursed be the man that buildeth this city — </span>That is, that shall attempt to build it.

So He appoints, from whom, as creatures, they received their lives, and to whom, as sinners, they had forfeited them. Rahab perished not with them that believed not, Heb 11:31. All her kindred were saved with her; thus faith in Christ brings salvation to the house, Ac 14:31. She, and they with her, were plucked as brands from the burning. With Rahab, or with the men of Jericho; our portion must be assigned, as we posses or disregard the sign of salvation; even faith in Christ, which worketh by love. Let us remember what depends upon our choice, and let us choose accordingly. God shows the weight of a Divine curse; where it rests there is no getting from under it; for it brings ruin without remedy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Adjured - i. e. put an oath upon them; or, perhaps, actually caused them themselves to take an oath (compare <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>). The words of the oath have in the original a rhythmical character which would tend to keep them on the lips and in the memory of the people.<p>Buildeth this city - i. e. rebuilds the fortifications. Jericho was at once occupied by the Benjamites. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>, and the natural advantages of the situation were such that it would not be likely to be left long desolate. Joshua speaks in the text as a warrior. He lays a ban on the re-erection of those lofty walls which had bidden defiance to God's host, and been by God's signal interposition overthrown. Hiel, the Bethelite, reckless of the prophecy recorded in our text, began and completed the circumvallation of the city a second time (see the marginal reference). Hiel did not found a new city but only fortified an existing one.<p>He shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born - i. e. when he begins this work his eldest son shall die, when he completes it his youngest shall die (see <a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a> note).<p>This chapter read in the light of the New Testament has indications of a further import and bearing than such as concerned Joshua and the Jews. As Joshua, the leader and captain of the Jewish theocracy, is a type of Christ, so is Jericho to be taken (with all Christian expositors) as a type of the powers opposed to Christ and His cause. The times which prepare for the close of God's present dispensation are signified in the days during which the people obeyed and waited; as the number of those days, seven, the number of perfection, represents that "fullness of time," known only to God, at which His dispensation will culminate and close. Thus the circumstances which lead up to the fall of Jericho are an acted prophecy, as was that fall itself, which sets forth the overthrow of all that resists the kingdom of which Christ is the head; and particularly the day of judgment, in which that overthrow will be fully and finally accomplished. Paul, in describing that day, seems to borrow his imagery from this chapter (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 6:26, 27.

Comp. Jos. <span class="ital">Antiq</span>. 5:1. 8. In the ungodly reign of Ahab the prophecy was fulfilled; Hiel, a native of Bethel, “built Jericho; he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Joshua” (<a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm" title="In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.">1 Kings 16:34</a>). Observe the incidents connected with Jericho in the life of the Antitype of the first Joshua. Here He entered into the house of Zacchæus (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm" title="And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at your house.">Luke 19:5</a>; <a href="/luke/19-9.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, as much as he also is a son of Abraham.">Luke 19:9</a>); here He healed blind Bartimæus (<a href="/mark/10-46.htm" title="And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.">Mark 10:46</a>; <a href="/mark/10-52.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.">Mark 10:52</a>); He mentioned Jericho in the parable of “the Good Samaritan” (<a href="/luke/10-30.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.">Luke 10:30</a>); in the vicinity of the city He repeated the announcement of His coming sufferings (<a href="/luke/18-31.htm" title="Then he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.">Luke 18:31</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua adjured them</span>. Caused them to swear, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, bound them by an oath, as the Hiphil implies here. This was the strict meaning of "adjure" at the time our version was made (cf. <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>). But it had also the less definite meaning which it now has, of solemnly warning a person to do something or to leave it undone (see <a href="/1_kings/22-16.htm">1 Kings 22:16</a>; <a href="/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>; <a href="/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>). The object of this solemn adjuration (see above) was to preserve Jericho as a spot devoted to God for ever; and for this reason a curse was pronounced upon any one who should attempt to found a city upon the devoted spot (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/13-16.htm">Deuteronomy 13:16</a>, "It shall not be rebuilt.") This curse actually fell on the reckless Hiel (<a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>; cf. Josephus, 'Antiq.,' V. 1:8), and he saw the laying of its foundations marked by the death of his eldest son, while the death of his youngest followed its completion. It does not seem that it was forbidden to build habitations on the spot, far Jericho is frequently <span class="accented">mentioned</span> in the New Testament, and the house of Zacchaeus (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>) was there. What seems to have been forbidden was the erection of a fortified city there (see Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 214). The mention of Jericho in ch. 18:21 does not imply that it was an inhabited city, but simply that the site of Jericho fell within the border of the tribe of Benjamin. For Jerusalem is also mentioned, and we know that it did not become theirs until the time of David. Whether the "city of palm trees" (<a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>) is Jericho, may be questioned. But in <a href="/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a> and in <a href="/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5</a> express mention is made of Jericho, the last time as the site of the school of the prophets. Some commentators have endeavoured to restrict the sense of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> used here to the building of fortifications. But this is unduly to restrict its meaning, for it is constantly used also of houses and altars (see <a href="/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). But the mention of gates clearly implies a fortified city. Commentators cite as parallel instances the curse of Agamemnon on Troy, of Croesus on Sidene (so Grotius from Strabo, lib. 13 de Ilio), and of Scipio upon Carthage, and it is observed that when Augustus rebuilt Carthage he carefully avoided the old site. <span class="cmt_word">In his first born.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> is often used of the price paid for a thing, as in <a href="/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-23.htm">Isaiah 7:23</a>. And in his youngest son. The commentators have remarked on the rhythmical parallelism here, and Keil and others have supposed the passage to be an extract from an old Hebrew songbook, such as that of Jasher (<a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>). But this parallelism is not only a characteristic of poetry, but of all solemn and impassioned utterances in the language. (See, for instance, <a href="/2_samuel/18-32.htm">2 Samuel 18:32</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). Masius, Munsterus, and others interpret the passage that the eldest son died when the foundation was laid; all the rest, but the youngest, in the interim; the youngest when the gates were set up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the seventh day the marching round the town commenced very early, at the dawning of the day, that they might go round seven times. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;, in the manner prescribed and carried out on the previous days, which had become a right through precept and practice. On the seventh circuit, when the priests had blown the trumpet, Joshua commanded the fighting men to raise a war-cry, announcing to them at the same time that the town, with all that was in it, was to be a ban to the Lord, with the exception of Rahab and the persons in her house, and warning them not to take of that which was laid under the ban, that they might not bring a ban upon the camp of Israel. The construction in v. 16, "it came to pass at the seventh time the priests had blown the trumpets, then Joshua said, ... " is more spirited than if the conjunction &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; had been used before &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1506; had been used. Because the Lord had given Jericho into the hands of the Israelites, they were to consecrate it to Him as a ban (cherem), i.e., as a holy thing belonging to Jehovah, which was not to be touched by man, as being the first-fruits of the land of Canaan. (On cherem, see the remarks at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28-29</a>.) Rahab alone was excepted from this ban, along with all that belonged to her, because she had hidden the spies. The inhabitants of an idolatrous town laid under the ban were to be put to death, together with their cattle, and all the property in the town to be burned, as Moses himself had enjoined on the basis of the law in <a href="/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>. The only exceptions were metals, gold, silver, and the vessels of brass and iron; these were to be brought into the treasury of the Lord, i.e., the treasury of the tabernacle, as being holy to the Lord (<a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>; vid., <a href="/numbers/31-54.htm">Numbers 31:54</a>). Whoever took to himself anything that had been laid under the ban, exposed himself to the ban, not only because he had brought an abomination into his house, as Moses observes in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, in relation to the gold and silver of idols, but because he had wickedly invaded the rights of the Lord, by appropriating that which had been laid under the ban, and had wantonly violated the ban itself. The words, "beware of the ban, that ye do not ban and take of the ban" (<a href="/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18</a>), point to this. As Lud. de Dieu observes, "the two things were altogether incompatible, to devote everything to God, and yet to apply a portion to their own private use; either the thing should not have been devoted, or having been devoted, it was their duty to abstain from it." Any such appropriation of what had been laid under the ban would make the camp of Israel itself a ban, and trouble it, i.e., bring it into trouble (conturbare, cf. <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>). In consequence of the trumpet-blast and the war-cry raised by the people, the walls of the town fell together, and the Israelites rushed into the town and took it, as had been foretold in <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>. The position of &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; is not to be understood as signifying that the people had raised the war-cry before the trumpet-blast, but may be explained on the ground, that in his instructions in <a href="/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a> Joshua had only mentioned the shouting. But any misinterpretation is prevented by the fact, that it is expressly stated immediately afterwards, that the people did not raise the great shout till they heard the trumpet-blast.<p>As far as the event itself is concerned, the difference attempts which have been made to explain the miraculous overthrow of the walls of Jericho as a natural occurrence, whether by an earthquake, or by mining, or by sudden storming, for which the inhabitants, who had been thrown into a false security by the marvellous procession repeated day after day for several days, were quite unprepared (as Ewald has tried to explain the miracle away), really deserve no serious refutation, being all of them arbitrarily forced upon the text. It is only from the naturalistic stand-point that the miracle could ever be denied; for it not only follows most appropriately upon the miraculous guidance of Israel through the Jordan, but is in perfect harmony with the purpose and spirit of the divine plan of salvation. "It is impossible," says Hess, "to imagine a more striking way, in which it could have been shown to the Israelites that Jehovah had given them the town. Now the river must retire to give them an entrance into the land, and now again the wall of the town must fall to make an opening into a fortified place. Two such decisive proofs of the co-operation of Jehovah so shortly after Moses' death, must have furnished a pledge, even to the most sensual, that the same God was with them who had led their fathers so mightily and so miraculously through the Read Sea." That this was in part the intention of the miracle, we learn from the close of the narrative (<a href="/joshua/6-27.htm">Joshua 6:27</a>). But this does not explain the true object of the miracle, or the reason why God gave up this town to the Israelites without any fighting on their part, through the miraculous overthrow of their walls. The reason for this we have to look for in the fact that Jericho was not only the first, but the strongest town of Canaan, and as such was the key to the conquest of the whole land, the possession of which would open the way to the whole, and give the whole, as it were, into their hands. The Lord would give His people the first and strongest town of Canaan, as the first-fruits of the land, without any effort on their part, as a sign that He was about to give them the whole land for a possession, according to His promise; in order that they might not regard the conquest of it as their own work, or the fruit of their own exertions, and look upon the land as a well-merited possession which they could do as they pleased with, but that they might ever use it as a gracious gift from the Lord, which he had merely conferred upon them as a trust, and which He could take away again, whenever they might fall from Him, and render themselves unworthy of His grace. This design on the part of God would of necessity become very obvious in the case of so strongly fortified a town as Jericho, whose walls would appear impregnable to a people that had grown up in the desert and was so utterly without experience in the art of besieging or storming fortified places, and in fact would necessarily remain impregnable, at all events for a long time, without the interposition of God. But if this was the reason why the Lord gave up Jericho to the Israelites by a miracle, it does not explain either the connection between the blast of trumpets or the war-cry of the people and the falling of the walls, or the reason for the divine instructions that the town was to be marched round every day for seven days, and seven times on the seventh day. Yet as this was an appointment of divine wisdom, it must have had some meaning.<p>The significance of this repeated marching round the town culminates unquestionably in the ark of the covenant and the trumpet-blast of the priests who went before the ark. In the account before us the ark is constantly called the ark of the Lord, to show that the Lord, who was enthroned upon the cherubim of the ark, was going round the hostile town in the midst of His people; whilst in <a href="/joshua/6-8.htm">Joshua 6:8</a> Jehovah himself is mentioned in the place of the ark of Jehovah. Seven priests went before the ark, bearing jubilee trumpets and blowing during the march. The first time that we read of a trumpet-blast is at Sinai, where the Lord announced His descent upon the mount to the people assembled at the foot to receive Him, not only by other fearful phenomena, but also by a loud and long-continued trumpet-blast (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14-18</a>). After this we find the blowing of trumpets prescribed as part of the Israelitish worship in connection with the observance of the seventh new moon's day (<a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>), and at the proclamation of the great year of jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>). Just as the trumpet-blast heard by the people when the covenant was made at Sinai was as it were a herald's call, announcing to the tribes of Israel the arrival of the Lord their God to complete His covenant and establish His kingdom upon earth; so the blowing of trumpets in connection with the round of feasts was intended partly to bring the people into remembrance before the Lord year by year at the commencement of the sabbatical month, that He might come to them and grant them the Sabbath rest of His kingdom, and partly at the end of every seven times seven years to announce on the great day of atonement the coming of the great year of grace and freedom, which was to bring to the people of God deliverance from bondage, return to their own possessions, and deliverance from the bitter labours of this earth, and to give them a foretaste of the blessed and glorious liberty to which the children of God would attain at the return of the Lord to perfect His kingdom (vid., Pentateuch, pp. 631f.). But when the Lord comes to found, to build up, and to perfect His kingdom upon earth, He also comes to overthrow and destroy the worldly power which opposes His kingdom. The revelation of the grace and mercy of God to His children, goes ever side by side with the revelation of justice and judgment towards the ungodly who are His foes. If therefore the blast of trumpets was the signal to the congregation of Israel of the gracious arrival of the Lord its God to enter into fellowship with it, no less did it proclaim the advent of judgment to an ungodly world. This shows clearly enough the meaning of the trumpet-blast at Jericho. The priests, who went before the ark of the covenant (the visible throne of the invisible God who dwelt among His people) and in the midst of the hosts of Israel, were to announce through the blast of trumpets both to the Israelites and Canaanites the appearance of the Lord of the whole earth for judgment upon Jericho, the strong bulwark of the Canaanitish power and rule, and to foretel to them through the falling of the walls of this fortification, which followed the blast of trumpets and the wary-cry of the soldiers of God, the overthrow of all the strong bulwarks of an ungodly world through the omnipotence of the Lord of heaven and earth. Thus the fall of Jericho became the symbol and type of the overthrow of every worldly power before the Lord, when He should come to lead His people into Canaan and establish His kingdom upon earth. On the ground of this event, the blowing of trumpets is frequently introduced in the writings of the prophets, as the signal and symbolical omen of the manifestations of the Lord in great judgments, through which He destroys one worldly power after another, and thus maintains and extends His kingdom upon earth, and leads it on towards that completion to which it will eventually attain when He descends from heaven in His glory at the time of the last trump, with a great shout, with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God, to raise the dead and change the living, to judge the world, cast the devil, death, and hell into the lake of fire, create a new heaven and new earth, and in the new Jerusalem erect the tabernacle of God among men for all eternity (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>.; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1</a>; 21).<p>The appointment of the march round Jericho, which was to be continued for seven days, and to be repeated seven times on the seventh day, was equally significant. The number seven is a symbol in the Scriptures of the work of God and of the perfection already produced or to be eventually secured by Him; a symbol founded upon the creation of the world in six days, and the completion of the works of creation by the resting of God upon the seventh day. Through this arrangement, that the walls of Jericho were not to fall till after they had been marched round for seven days, and not till after this had been repeated seven times on the seventh day, and then amidst the blast of the jubilee trumpets and the war-cry of the soldiers of the people of God, the destruction of this town, the key to Canaan, was intended by God to become a type of the final destruction at the last day of the power of this world, which exalts itself against the kingdom of God. In this way He not only showed to His congregation that it would not be all at once, but only after long-continued conflict, and at the end of the world, that the worldly power by which it was opposed would be overthrown, but also proved to the enemies of His kingdom, that however long their power might sustain itself in opposition to the kingdom of God, it would at last be destroyed in a moment.</body></html>
