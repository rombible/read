As promised deliverances must be expected in God's way, so they must be expected in his time. At last the people were to shout: they did so, and the walls fell. This was a shout of faith; they believed the walls of Jericho would fall.

The rising early would be necessary to give time for encompassing the city seven times. Jericho appears to have been a city of considerable size and population; and each passage of the large host round it could hardly have taken less than an hour and a half. Thus, with the necessary intervals of rest, the evening would be at hand when Joshua gave the signal to shout <a href="/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>; and the work of slaughter was probably commenced just as the hours of the Sabbath were passed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. it came to pass at the seventh time, &#8230; Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city&#8212;This delay brought out their faith and obedience in so remarkable a manner, that it is celebrated by the apostle (Heb 11:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shout, </span> to testify your faith in God’s promise, and thankfulness for this glorious mercy, and to encourage yourselves and brethren, and to strike a terror into your enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass at the seventh time,....
