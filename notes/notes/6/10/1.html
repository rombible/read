So called, perhaps by anticipation, Jerusalem, since it seems to have had this name given it by the Israelites, when they had got possession of it: and Jerusalem signifies "the possession of Salem" (w), and in memory of this its ancient name, the Jews say (x), they do not put "jod" in Jerusalem between "lamed" and "mem"; though some make the signification of it, "they shall see peace" (y); and others, nearer to its old name, and with respect to it, "fear Salem", O ye enemies. Now the king of this place <p>had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; which, being nearer to him than Jericho, the more alarmed him: <p>as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; burnt the one, and slew the other; and this terrified him, lest he and his city should undergo the same fate: <p>and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; which as it weakened the interest of the kings of Canaan, might set an example to other places to do the like. Abarbinel suggests, that the Gibeonites making peace with Israel secretly, without the knowledge of their king, as he supposes, made Adonizedek fearful, lest his subjects should do the like; the Jewish chronologers say (z), that these three acts respecting Jericho, Ai, and Gibeon, were all finished within three months. <p>(w) Reland, p. 833.

Its elevation is remarkable, but is occasioned not from its being on the summit of one of the numerous hills of Judæa, but on the edge of one of the highest table-lands of the country. From every side, except the south, the ascent to it is perpetual, and it must always have presented the appearance, beyond any important city that has ever existed on the earth, of a “<span class="ital">mountain city, enthroned on a mountain fortress</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iv) But besides being thus elevated more than 2500 feet above the level of the sea, it was separated by deep and precipitous ravines from the rocky plateau of which it formed a part. These slopes surround it on the southern, south-eastern, and western sides, and out of them the city rose “like the walls of a fortress out of its ditches.” Hence its early strength and subsequent greatness.

Melchizedek in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>). The <span class="accented">name</span> given to the king of Jerusalem was good enough, and no doubt was a survival of earlier and purer times. In the days of Melchizedek the name corresponded to the character. <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem</span>. Hebrew, <span class="accented">Jerushalaim</span>, with the usual dual termination. It has been generally supposed to be the same with Salem, or rather Shalem, the city of which Melehizedek was king, and this is supported by the fact that the name of Salem is given to Jerusalem in <a href="/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>. But it is by no means certain that this is the case. The first to dispute the identity of the two places was St. Jerome, who declares that the Salem of Melchizedek was eight miles from Scythopolis, and that the ruins of the palace of Melchizedek could still be seen there (see also <a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>). The term Salem, as indicative of the security and strength of Jerusalem, might not unnaturally be applied to it by the Psalmist; while; on the other hand, the dual form of Jerusalem seems difficult to account for on the theory of the identity of Jerusalem and Salem. This dual form has been a difficulty to critics; and Mr. Grove, in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' conjectures that it may have arisen from an attempt to twist the archaic Phoenician form into agreement with the more modern Hebrew idiom, just as the Greeks afterwards twisted the name into Hierosolyma, or the holy Solyma. But a simpler explanation may be found in the fact that Jerusalem, like many other cities, consisted of two parts, the upper and the lower town (cf. <a href="/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a> with ver. 1, 7 and 21, and <a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-8</a>), while in earlier times the upper or lower town alone existed. Plural names of cities were not uncommon in later ages, as Athenae and Thebae. The name has been variously derived. Some have thought that as it is also called Jebus (<a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>; <a href="/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10</a>), from its being the chief city of the Jebusites, it was originally Jebus-salem, and hence by a corruption Jerusalem. But this derivation has now been abandoned, and opinions differ as to whether it is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> signifying "peaceful inheritance" (Ewald, Keil), or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> "peaceful settlement" (Gesenius, Lee). Gesenius objects to the former derivation that it would require dagesh in the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The fathers and mediaeval divines, misled by Origen, translate it "vision of peace." This translation is alluded to in the well-known hymns <span class="accented">Urbs beata Sion</span> and O <span class="accented">quanta qualia.</span> Origen supposed it to come from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>. Another difficult question is <span class="accented">when</span> the name was given, for there can be little doubt that the Book of Joshua was written before the time of David. It is possible that the name may have been given by the Jebusites themselves in consequence of their secure possession of it, notwithstanding the subjugation of the surrounding country by the Israelites. And when David had seized upon it and made it his capital, he would not be likely to change so suitable a name. For the Jebusites, evidently by their invariable position last among the nations of Canaan, the most insignificant among them, were enabled to defy the Israelite power long after their more powerful neighbours had succumbed. and David no doubt chose the situation of Jerusalem for his capital not only because, unlike Hebron, it enabled him to dwell among his own people without cutting himself off from intercourse with the other tribes of Israel; but because, as a mountain fastness remote from the plains of Esdraelon and the Orontes, which were the great highways of the Egyptian and Assyrian kings on their military expeditions, it would enable him to consolidate his power, and to secure that empire which became his from the force of his genius and the favour of God. We may remark upon the antecedent probability of the fact that the king of a place situated as Jerusalem is should stand at the head of this league. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua then summoned the Gibeonites, charged them with their deceit, and pronounced upon them the curse of eternal servitude: "There shall not be cut off from you a servant," i.e., ye shall never cease to be servants, ye shall remain servants for ever (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>), "and that as hewers of wood and drawers of waters for our God's house." This is a fuller definition of the expression "for all the congregation" in <a href="/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21</a>. The Gibeonites were to perform for the congregation the slaves' labour of hewing wood and drawing water for the worship of the sanctuary-a duty which was performed, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>, by the lowest classes of people. In this way the curse of Noah upon Canaan (<a href="/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>) was literally fulfilled upon the Hivites of the Gibeonitish republic. </body></html>
