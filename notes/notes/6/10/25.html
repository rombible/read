This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put your feet upon the necks of these kings - A symbol of complete subjugation (compare the marginal references and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. put your feet upon the necks of these kings&#8212;not as a barbarous insult, but a symbolical action, expressive of a complete victory (De 33:29; Ps 110:5; Mal 4:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joshua said, rest not, nor be dismayed,....

Perhaps Joshua would convey the idea that the Israelites were not to attribute their success to their leader, or to any Divine favor resting upon him as an individual, but to believe that, as long as they served God faithfully, His presence would be as much with them as it was at that particular time and under that particular leader. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave that was a Makkedah. When they were discovered there, Joshua ordered large stones to be rolled before the entrance to the cave, and men to be placed there to watch, whilst the others pursued the enemy without ceasing, and smote their rear (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>), and prevented their entering into their cities. He himself remained at Makkedah (<a href="/joshua/10-21.htm">Joshua 10:21</a>). </body></html>
