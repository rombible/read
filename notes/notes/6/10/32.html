When Sennacherib, king of Assyria, “came up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took them” (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2Kings 18:13</a>), although he “laid siege to Lachish, and all his power with him” (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-9.htm" title="After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,">2Chronicles 32:9</a>), he had to abandon the siege (<a href="/2_kings/19-8.htm" title="So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.">2Kings 19:8</a>). Again, when Nebuchadnezzar invaded the kingdom of Judah in the reign of Zedekiah, the last king, we read ( <a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm" title="When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defended cities remained of the cities of Judah.">Jeremiah 34:7</a>) of his army fighting “against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah, for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.” All these notices of Lachish point to its being a fortress of considerable strength. And the undesigned and indirect agreement of these three passages, which lie so far asunder, is worthy of observation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:28-43 Joshua made speed in taking these cities. See what a great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we will be diligent, and improve our opportunities. God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel. They could not have gotten the victory, if God had not undertaken the battle. We conquer when God fights for us; if he be for us, who can be against us?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Libnah - The word means "white" or "distinct," and undoubtedly points to some natural feature of the spot, perhaps the "Garde Blanche" of the Crusaders, a castle which stood on or near the white cliffs which bound the plain of Philistia to the east opposite to Ascalon.

"All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel.

Of course this did not take place till the day after the battle, as the army could not return from their pursuit of the foe to the camp at Makkedah till the night after the battle; possibly it did not take place till the second day, if the pursuit had lasted any longer. In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, "all the men of Israel" are all the warriors in the camp. &#1492;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, with &#1492; artic., instead of the relative pronoun (see Ges. 109; Ew. 331, b.); and the ending &#1493;&#1468;&#1488; for &#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, as in <a href="/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a> (see Ew. 190, b.). The fact that the military leaders set their feet at Joshua's command upon the necks of the conquered kings, was not a sign of barbarity, which it is necessary to excuse by comparing it with still greater barbarities on the part of the Canaanites, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>, but was a symbolical act, a sign of complete subjugation, which was customary in this sense even in the Eastern empire (see Bynaeus de calceis, p. 318, and Constant. Porphyrogen de cerimon. aulae Byzant. ii. 19). It was also intended in this instance to stimulate the Israelites to further conflict with the Canaanites. This is stated in the words of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-25.htm">Joshua 10:25</a>): "Fear not, nor be dismayed (vid., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>); for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies." On the putting to death and then hanging, see <a href="/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>. The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/joshua/10-27.htm">Joshua 10:27</a>) are generally understood as signifying, that after the bodies of the kings had been cast into the cave, the Israelites placed large stones before the entrance, just as in other cases heaps of stones were piled upon the graves of criminals that had been executed (vid., <a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>), and that these stones remained there till the account before us was written. But this leaves the words &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491; unexplained, as &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; never occurs in any other case where the formula "until this day" is used with the simple meaning that a thing had continued to the writer's own time. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; expresses the thought that the day referred to was the very same day about which the author was writing, and no other (see <a href="/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a>, etc.). If, therefore, it has any meaning at all in the present instance, we must connect the whole clause with the one preceding, and even construe it as a relative clause: "where they (the kings) had hidden themselves, and they (the Israelites) had placed large stones at the mouth of the cave until that very day" (on which the kings were fetched out and executed). </body></html>
