God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel.

Libnah belonged to the district of the Shephelah, the maritime lowland of Judah, and we find it enumerated among the cities of this district (<a href="/joshua/15-42.htm" title="Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,">Joshua 15:42</a>). With its suburbs it was appropriated to the priests (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm" title="Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-57.htm" title="And to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Judah, namely, Hebron, the city of refuge, and Libnah with her suburbs, and Jattir, and Eshtemoa, with their suburbs,">1 Chronicles 6:57</a>), but revolted from Judah in the reign of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm" title="Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.">2 Kings 8:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/21-10.htm" title="So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.">2 Chronicles 21:10</a>). On account of the accordance of the name Libnah (“<span class="ital">white</span>”) with the “Blanche-garde” of the Crusaders, Dean Stanley would place it at <span class="ital">Tell es-Safieh</span>, about 5 miles north-west of <span class="ital">Beit-Jibrín</span>. Others would place it 4 miles west of the same spot, at <span class="ital">Arak el Menshîyeh</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All Israel.</span> The expression is not to be pressed in a literal sense. "All Israel" is simply equivalent to "all his disposable troops." <span class="cmt_word">Libnah</span>. This belonged to the lowlands of Palestine. See note on ch. 9:1; also <a href="/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>. It became a Levitical city. It revolted from Judah in the reign of Joram (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). It seems to have returned to its allegiance, since we find it not included in the conquest of Israel by Shalmaneser, while, on the other hand, it undergoes a siege among the fenced cities of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>). The cause (see Blunt 'Undesigned Coincidences,' part 2:27) of this return is not far to seek. The Levites cast off the authority of Joram "because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers" (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-10.htm">2 Chronicles 21:10, 11</a>). It probably remained independent - for it was not likely to have joined itself to Israel, either from geographical position or religious principles - until the accession of Joash terminated the connection between the royal house of Judah and the descendants of the wicked Ahab. Libnah, or the white city, has been identified with Tell es Safieh, the <span class="accented">Blanche Garde</span> of the Crusaders. See Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 207, 258. Lieut. Conder, however, supposes it to have been Eleutheropolis, now Beit Jibrin, and Capt. Warren believes he has found it at Ibna. Vanclevelde suggests yet another site. But Lieut. Conder's description of the hill on which Tell es Safieh stands as "a white precipice of many hundred feet" ('Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper,' July, 1875), would account for the name Libnah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua then commanded the five kings to be fetched out of the cave, and directed the leaders of the army to set their feet upon the necks of the kings; and when this had been done, he ordered the kings to be put to death, and to be hanged upon trees until the evening, when their bodies were to be thrown into the cave in which they had concealed themselves. Of course this did not take place till the day after the battle, as the army could not return from their pursuit of the foe to the camp at Makkedah till the night after the battle; possibly it did not take place till the second day, if the pursuit had lasted any longer. In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, "all the men of Israel" are all the warriors in the camp. &#1492;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, with &#1492; artic., instead of the relative pronoun (see Ges. 109; Ew. 331, b.); and the ending &#1493;&#1468;&#1488; for &#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, as in <a href="/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a> (see Ew. 190, b.). The fact that the military leaders set their feet at Joshua's command upon the necks of the conquered kings, was not a sign of barbarity, which it is necessary to excuse by comparing it with still greater barbarities on the part of the Canaanites, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>, but was a symbolical act, a sign of complete subjugation, which was customary in this sense even in the Eastern empire (see Bynaeus de calceis, p. 318, and Constant. Porphyrogen de cerimon. aulae Byzant. ii. 19). It was also intended in this instance to stimulate the Israelites to further conflict with the Canaanites. This is stated in the words of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-25.htm">Joshua 10:25</a>): "Fear not, nor be dismayed (vid., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>); for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies." On the putting to death and then hanging, see <a href="/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>. The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/joshua/10-27.htm">Joshua 10:27</a>) are generally understood as signifying, that after the bodies of the kings had been cast into the cave, the Israelites placed large stones before the entrance, just as in other cases heaps of stones were piled upon the graves of criminals that had been executed (vid., <a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>), and that these stones remained there till the account before us was written. But this leaves the words &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491; unexplained, as &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; never occurs in any other case where the formula "until this day" is used with the simple meaning that a thing had continued to the writer's own time. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; expresses the thought that the day referred to was the very same day about which the author was writing, and no other (see <a href="/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a>, etc.). If, therefore, it has any meaning at all in the present instance, we must connect the whole clause with the one preceding, and even construe it as a relative clause: "where they (the kings) had hidden themselves, and they (the Israelites) had placed large stones at the mouth of the cave until that very day" (on which the kings were fetched out and executed). </body></html>
