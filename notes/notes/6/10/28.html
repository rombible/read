God here showed his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations of which the Canaanites had been guilty, and shows us how great the provocation was, by the greatness of the destruction brought upon them. Here also was typified the destruction of all the enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath. The Lord fought for Israel.

Not only did Joshua smite his enemies "unto Makkedah," but the incarceration of the kings in a cave at Makkedah showed that in the headlong flight of the enemy, Makkedah, which though not mentioned by name among the cities of the confederation, was no doubt, to a certain extent, implicated in it. It is worthy of remark that while Libnah, Debir, and Makkedah are mentioned among the cities destroyed in this campaign, though they are not named among the cities of the league, Jarmuth, on the contrary, though it is one of the cities named, does not appear to have been taken with the rest. <span class="cmt_word">With the edge of the sword</span>. Literally, "to the mouth of the sword," from its devouring character. <span class="cmt_word">All the souls.</span> All the human beings. The ban under which everything in Jericho was laid did not apply to the other cities, though (see note on Joshua 8:26) all the inhabitants, without distinction, were to be exterminated. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua then commanded the five kings to be fetched out of the cave, and directed the leaders of the army to set their feet upon the necks of the kings; and when this had been done, he ordered the kings to be put to death, and to be hanged upon trees until the evening, when their bodies were to be thrown into the cave in which they had concealed themselves. Of course this did not take place till the day after the battle, as the army could not return from their pursuit of the foe to the camp at Makkedah till the night after the battle; possibly it did not take place till the second day, if the pursuit had lasted any longer. In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, "all the men of Israel" are all the warriors in the camp. &#1492;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, with &#1492; artic., instead of the relative pronoun (see Ges. 109; Ew. 331, b.); and the ending &#1493;&#1468;&#1488; for &#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, as in <a href="/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a> (see Ew. 190, b.). The fact that the military leaders set their feet at Joshua's command upon the necks of the conquered kings, was not a sign of barbarity, which it is necessary to excuse by comparing it with still greater barbarities on the part of the Canaanites, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>, but was a symbolical act, a sign of complete subjugation, which was customary in this sense even in the Eastern empire (see Bynaeus de calceis, p. 318, and Constant. Porphyrogen de cerimon. aulae Byzant. ii. 19). It was also intended in this instance to stimulate the Israelites to further conflict with the Canaanites. This is stated in the words of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-25.htm">Joshua 10:25</a>): "Fear not, nor be dismayed (vid., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>); for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies." On the putting to death and then hanging, see <a href="/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>. The words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/joshua/10-27.htm">Joshua 10:27</a>) are generally understood as signifying, that after the bodies of the kings had been cast into the cave, the Israelites placed large stones before the entrance, just as in other cases heaps of stones were piled upon the graves of criminals that had been executed (vid., <a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>), and that these stones remained there till the account before us was written. But this leaves the words &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491; unexplained, as &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; never occurs in any other case where the formula "until this day" is used with the simple meaning that a thing had continued to the writer's own time. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; expresses the thought that the day referred to was the very same day about which the author was writing, and no other (see <a href="/joshua/5-11.htm">Joshua 5:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17</a>, etc.). If, therefore, it has any meaning at all in the present instance, we must connect the whole clause with the one preceding, and even construe it as a relative clause: "where they (the kings) had hidden themselves, and they (the Israelites) had placed large stones at the mouth of the cave until that very day" (on which the kings were fetched out and executed). </body></html>
