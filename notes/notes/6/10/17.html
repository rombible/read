This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The thread of the narrative, broken by the four intermediate verses, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-15</a>, is now resumed from <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 10:16-27.

This phenomenon, which resembled the terrible hail in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24</a>), was manifestly a miraculous occurrence produced by the omnipotent power of God, inasmuch as the hail-stones slew the enemy without injuring the Israelites, who were pursuing them. By this the Israelites were to be made to see that it was not their own power, but the supernatural help of their God, which had given them the victory; whilst the enemy discovered that it was not only the people of Israel, but the God of Israel, that had devoted them to destruction. </body></html>
