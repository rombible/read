Goshen has been thought to be the town of that name mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-51.htm" title="And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:51</a>; but it is inconceivable that a single place of no importance in the mountains of Judah should give the name to an extensive district, which is manifestly intended here. If we knew the exact northern boundary of the land of Goshen assigned for a distinct residence to Joseph’s brethren in Egypt, it might help to clear up the meaning of this passage. That Goshen, at its Egyptian end, bordered upon the Delta is clear. But how far did Goshen extend towards the north? In <a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-21.htm" title="And Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came down to take away their cattle.">1Chronicles 7:21-22</a>, we find that Ephraim’s children <span class= "ital">in his lifetime </span>made an incursion into Canaan as far as Gath. But this was during the time that Israel dwelt in the land of Goshen. Did they suppose that they were in the land of Goshen when they plundered the men of Gath? If Goshen (frontier) could be the general name for the <span class= "ital">border-land </span>between Egypt and Palestine, we can understand that the borders might vary with the power of the Egyptian monarchy for the time being. The country of Goshen, <span class= "ital">unto Gibeon, </span>seems to be described from south to north; Gibeon being intended as the northern boundary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/joshua/10-41.htm" title="And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.">Joshua 10:41</a></span>. <span class="ital">From Kadesh-barnea — </span>Which lay in the south of Canaan, (<a href="/numbers/34-4.htm" title="And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:">Numbers 34:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-19.htm" title="And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>,) and belonged to the tribe of Judah, <a href="/joshua/15-3.htm" title="And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side to Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:">Joshua 15:3</a>.

This country of Goshen is not that in the land of Egypt, as Kimchi rightly remarks. Bishop Cumberland (m) is of opinion, that the Phoenician or Canaanitish pastors, who were driven out of Egypt before their expulsion, inhabited that part of Egypt called Goshen, which the Israelites some years after dwelt in; and when those shepherds were driven out, they came into this part of the land of Canaan, and called it after the name of the country they left in Egypt; and might perhaps the rather choose to give it this name, because of the goodness and fruitfulness of it, in which it resembled the country they had formerly dwelt in. <p>(m) Remarks on the History of Sanchoniatho, p. 380, 381. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">41</span>. <span class="ital">from Kadesh-barnea</span>] i.e. from the wilderness in which Kadesh-barnea lay.
