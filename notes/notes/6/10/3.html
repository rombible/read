At its head stood the king of Jerusalem, which, from its central situation and its almost impregnable position (see notes on Joshua 15:63), might naturally stand at the head of such a league. Next came Hebron, which, from its importance from an early period (<a href="/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27</a>), and the gigantic stature of its inhabitants (<a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10, 11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2</a>), as well as its daughter cities (ver. 37), would prove a formidable addition to the strength of the confederates. Colossal blocks of stone, testifying to the presence there of the primeval races of Palestine, are still to be found in the neighbourhood. Hebron stands in "the hill country of Judaea." Its situation has been much admired, standing as it does nearly 3,000 feet above the level of the Mediterranean, and commanding the most extensive views of the Holy Land. This is one of the most interesting in its reminiscences of all the cities in Palestine. Here Abraham pitched his tent, near the "oak of Mature." Here was the burying place of Abraham and Sarah, which has been kept in memory by an unwavering tradition even to this very day; and, sacred ground though it be to the Mohammedans, was opened to the Prince of Wales and his companions in 1862. This was the inheritance of Caleb, and here, where the affections of every Israelite would most closely centre, David fixed his capital until compelled to change it by reasons to which we have already referred. Hebron seems to have been successively occupied by various members of the Phoenician confederation. It was first founded, we learn, seven years before Zoan in Egypt (<a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>). When we first hear of it, it is in the possession of Mature the Amorite (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>). In <a href="/genesis/28.htm">Genesis 28</a>, it has clearly passed into the possession of the Hittites, and the mention of the children of Heth is too express for us to suppose that the term Hittite is used generally for the inhabitants of the land. At a much later period the Canaanites, or lowlanders, had, strangely enough, obtained possession (<a href="/judges/1-10.htm">Judges 1:10</a>), and here again the accurate acquaintance of the historian with the names of the tribes (see <a href="/judges/1-4.htm">Judges 1:4, 21, 26, 35</a>) forbids us to suppose that he is speaking loosely. Piram king of Jarmuth. Jarmuth is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>, and in <a href="/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>. It has been identified with Yarmuk (see Robinson, II. sec. 11, with whom Vandevelde and Conder agree), where there are the remains of very ancient walls and cisterns. Of its size and importance in the time of Joshua we know nothing. Japhia king of Lachish. Like Jarmuth, Lachish was in the Shephe-lah, or lowlands, of Judah, and we frequently hear of it in the later history of the Jews, as in <a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14, 17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>; also <a href="/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>. It has been identified by Von Raumer and Vandevelde, whom Keil follows, with Um Lakis, though Robinson ('Biblical Researches' II. 388) denies this on the authority of Eusebius and Jerome; "but not on any reasonable grounds" (Vandevelde). This is the more clear in that Robinson rejects the authority of the Onomasticon in the case of Eglon. Um Lakis is only an hour and a quarter's journey from Ajlann or Eglon, and this narrative (vers. 31-36) shows that Eglon was on the way from Lachish to Hebron. Conder, in his 'Handbook' and in 'Pal. Exploration Fund Quart. Paper,' Jan., 1878, p. 20, suggests Tell el Hesy, a name which he thinks may "be a corruption of Lachlsh." This is a great mound on the main road from Eleutheropolis to Gaza. It is a strong argument for Um Lakis that there are an immense number of instances where the places retain their ancient names. The strongest argument for Tell el Hesy is that Laehish was evidently a place of some strength. Joshua, we read (ver. 32), "encamped against it" (this is said only of La-chish and Eglon), and "took it on the second day," and it successfully resisted the king of Assyria. Now Tell el Hesy was a "great mound" (Conder); but Um Lakis is described by Vandevelde as situated on "a low mound." <span class="cmt_word">Debir king of Eglon.</span> This, the modern Ajlan, according to the best authorities, was on the road from Eleutheropolis to Gaza, not far from Lachish. Ruins are to be found there; but we have no means of ascertaining the size and importance of the town in the time of Joshua.
