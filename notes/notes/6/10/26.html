Upon the cross of the true Joshua, the enemies of the Israel of God are exhibited. “He made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it” (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:15-27 None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. This shows their perfect safety. The kings were called to an account, as rebels against the Israel of God. Refuges of lies will but secure for God's judgment. God punished the abominable wickedness of these kings, the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And by this public act of justice, done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of the sins of the nations that God cast out from before them. Here is a type and figure of Christ's victories over the powers of darkness, and of believers' victories through him. In our spiritual conflicts we must not be satisfied with obtaining some important victory. We must pursue our scattered enemies, searching out the remains of sin as they rise up in our hearts, and thus pursue the conquest. In so doing, the Lord will afford light until the warfare be accomplished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put your feet upon the necks of these kings - A symbol of complete subjugation (compare the marginal references and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. put your feet upon the necks of these kings&#8212;not as a barbarous insult, but a symbolical action, expressive of a complete victory (De 33:29; Ps 110:5; Mal 4:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He <span class="bld">hanged them, </span> after they were dead, as a brand of infamy, and for the terror and instruction of others. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And afterwards Joshua smote them and slew them,....
