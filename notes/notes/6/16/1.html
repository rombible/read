This spring, which rises amid the nebek trees and the wheat fields, "springs from the earth at the eastern base of a little knoll; the water is sweet, clear, and agreeable, neither cold nor warm" (Ritter).

This border coincides with the northern border of Benjamin (see <a href="/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11-20</a>).
