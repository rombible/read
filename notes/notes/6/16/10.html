The reasons for granting these additional cities to the Ephraimites can only be conjectured. Perhaps the territory assigned to this numerous tribe proved on experiment to be too small; and therefore some towns, which are named in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-29.htm">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>, were given to them from the kindred Manassites, the latter being recompensed (<a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a> note) at the expense of Issachar and Asher. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. they drave not out the Canaanites &#8230; but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute&#8212;This is the first mention of the fatal policy of the Israelites, in neglecting the divine command (De 20:16) to exterminate the idolaters.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Canaanites</span> were not driven out until Solomon’s time, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm" title="For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelled in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.">1 Kings 9:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Under tribute, </span> as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/17-13.htm" title="Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.">Joshua 17:13</a> <a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm" title="For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelled in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.">1 Kings 9:16</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they drove not out the Canaanites which dwelt in Gezer,....

There is a distinction, apparently, between this passage and ch. 15:63. There the tribe of Judah was unable to drive out the Jebusites from their stronghold, and no mention is made of tribute. Here the Ephraimites seem deliberately to have preferred the easier task of reducing the Canaanites to tribute to the sterner and more difficult task of destroying them utterly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The territory commencing at the boundary lines mentioned was allotted to Ephraim and Manasseh as their inheritance. </body></html>
