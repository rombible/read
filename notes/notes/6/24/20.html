For LOVE is the only genuine principle whence all acceptable service of God can spring. The Father seeks only such to worship him, as worship him in spirit and in truth. The carnal mind of man is enmity against God, therefore, is not capable of such spiritual worship. Hence the necessity of being born again. But numbers rest in mere forms, as tasks imposed upon them. Joshua puts them to their choice; but not as if it were indifferent whether they served God or not. Choose you whom ye will serve, now the matter is laid plainly before you. He resolves to do this, whatever others did. Those that are bound for heaven, must be willing to swim against the stream. They must not do as the most do, but as the best do. And no one can behave himself as he ought in any station, who does not deeply consider his religious duties in family relations. The Israelites agree with Joshua, being influenced by the example of a man who had been so great a blessing to them; We also will serve the Lord. See how much good great men do, by their influence, if zealous in religion. Joshua brings them to express full purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord. They must come off from all confidence in their own sufficiency, else their purposes would be in vain. The service of God being made their deliberate choice, Joshua binds them to it by a solemn covenant. He set up a monument of it. In this affecting manner Joshua took his last leave of them; if they perished, their blood would be upon their own heads. Though the house of God, the Lord's table, and even the walls and trees before which we have uttered our solemn purposes of serving him, would bear witness against us if we deny him, yet we may trust in him, that he will put his fear into our hearts, that we shall not depart from him. God alone can give grace, yet he blesses our endeavours to engage men to his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Choose - Service of God in sincerity and truth can only result from a free and willing allegiance of the heart.

Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth&#8212;After having enumerated so many grounds for national gratitude, Joshua calls on them to declare, in a public and solemn manner, whether they will be faithful and obedient to the God of Israel. He avowed this to be his own unalterable resolution, and urged them, if they were sincere in making a similar avowal, "to put away the strange gods that were among them"&#8212;a requirement which seems to imply that some were suspected of a strong hankering for, or concealed practice of, the idolatry, whether in the form of Zabaism, the fire-worship of their Chaldean ancestors, or the grosser superstitions of the Canaanites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He will turn, </span> i.e. he will alter his course and the manner of his dealing with you, and will be as severe as ever he was kind and gracious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Consume you, after that he hath done you good; </span> he will repent of all his former kindness, and his goodness abused will be turned into fury. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If you forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods,.... Joshua knew the proneness of this people to idolatry, and therefore expresses his jealousy of them, that they would not be able to continue in the service of God, and would be apt to be carried away after idols; and therefore, to make them the more cautious and watchful, he represents to them the danger they were in, and what would befall them should they forsake the Lord they now promised to serve, and follow after other gods, which their fathers worshipped before they were called out of their estate of Heathenism, or which the Canaanites, or Egyptians worshipped, whose examples they were too ready to imitate: <p>then he will turn and do you hurt; not that there is properly any change in God, either of his counsel or covenant, or of love and affection to his people, but of his providential dealings, or outward manner of acting towards men; or the sense is, he will again do you hurt, bring evils and calamities upon you again and again, frequently as you revolt from him, such as the sword, pestilence, famine, and captivity, which these people after experienced when they fell into idolatry: <p>and consume you; by these his sore judgments: <p>after that he hath done you good; by bringing you into such a good land, and bestowing so many good things upon you, natural, civil, and religious; and yet, notwithstanding, being disobedient to him, and especially in the instances mentioned, they are made to expect his resentment, and the effects of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">then he will turn</span>] He will turn round; He will alter His attitude towards you. “Convertet se et affliget vos atque subvertet,” Vulgate. “The Lord schal turne hym silf, and schal turment зou,” Wyclif.

St. James is speaking of God as He is in Himself, sublime in His unchangeableness and bountiful purposes towards mankind. Joshua and the prophets, speaking by way of accommodation to our imperfect modes of expression, speak of Him as He is in relation to us. In reality it is not He but we who change. He has no more altered His position than the sun, which, as we say, rises in the east and sets in the west. But as He is in eternal opposition to all that is false or evil, we, when we turn aside from what is good and true, must of necessity exchange His favour for His displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">Do you hurt.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">do evil to you.<span class="cmt_word"></span> After that he hath done you good.</span> This implies what has been before stated, that it is not God who is inconsistent but man, not God who has changed His mind, but man who has changed his. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These overwhelming manifestations of grace on the part of the Lord laid Israel under obligations to serve the Lord with gratitude and sincerity. "Now therefore fear the Lord (&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, pointed like a verb &#1492;&#1500;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>), and serve Him in sincerity and in truth," i.e., without hypocrisy, or the show of piety, in simplicity and truth of heart (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-16.htm">Judges 9:16</a>, <a href="/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a>). "Put away the gods (Elohim  equals  the strange gods in <a href="/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>) which your fathers served on the other side of the Euphrates and in Egypt." This appeal does not presuppose any gross idolatry on the part of the existing generation, which would have been at variance with the rest of the book, in which Israel is represented as only serving Jehovah during the lifetime of Joshua. If the people had been in possession of idols, they would have given them up to Joshua to be destroyed, as they promised to comply with his demand (<a href="/joshua/24-16.htm">Joshua 24:16</a>.). But even if the Israelites were not addicted to gross idolatry in the worship of idols, they were not altogether free from idolatry either in Egypt or in the desert. As their fathers were possessed of teraphim in Mesopotamia (see at <a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>), so the Israelites had not kept themselves entirely free from heathen and idolatrous ways, more especially the demon-worship of Egypt (comp. <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a> with <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-3.htm">Joshua 23:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8</a>, and <a href="/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>); and even in the time of Joshua their worship of Jehovah may have been corrupted by idolatrous elements. This admixture of the pure and genuine worship of Jehovah with idolatrous or heathen elements, which is condemned in <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a> as the worship of Seirim, and by Ezekiel (l. c.) as the idolatrous worship of the people in Egypt, had its roots in the corruption of the natural heart, through which it is at all times led to make to itself idols of mammon, worldly lusts, and other impure thoughts and desires, to which it cleaves, without being able to tear itself entirely away from them. This more refined idolatry might degenerate in the case of many persons into the grosser worship of idols, so that Joshua had ample ground for admonishing the people to put away the strange gods, and serve the Lord.</body></html>
