He who aims at the same mind which was in Christ Jesus, will glory in bearing the last testimony to his Saviour's goodness, and in telling to all around, the obligations with which the unmerited goodness of God has bound him. The assembly came together in a solemn religious manner. Joshua spake to them in God's name, and as from him. His sermon consists of doctrine and application. The doctrinal part is a history of the great things God had done for his people, and for their fathers before them. The application of this history of God's mercies to them, is an exhortation to fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and that it might be continued.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The other side of the flood - Better "On the other side of the river," i. e. the Euphrates.

The reference in the text to the original state of those who were the forefathers of the nation, is made to show that they were no better than others: God chose them not for their excellences but of His own mere motion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 24:2-13.

They seemed to be instinct with a divinity which exercised an almost irresistible fascination over their first beholders. The sight of the “sun when it shined, and of the moon walking in brightness,” was a temptation as potent to them as to us it is inconceivable. “Their heart was secretly enticed, and their mouth kissed their hand” (<a href="/context/job/31-26.htm" title="If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;...">Job 31:26-27</a>). There was also another form of idolatry, though less universal in its influence. “There were giants on the earth in those days;” giants, if not actually, yet by their colossal strength and awful majesty; the Pharaohs and Nimrods, whose form we still trace on the ornaments of Egypt and Assyria in their gigantic proportions, the mighty hunters, the royal priests, the deified men. From the control of these powers, before which all meaner men bowed down, from the long ancestral prepossessions of ‘country and kindred and father’s house,’ the first worshippers of One who was above all alike, had painfully to disentangle themselves.” Stanley’s <span class="ital">Jewish Church</span>, <a href="/context/joshua/1-15.htm" title="Until the LORD have given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God gives them: then you shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sun rise....">Joshua 1:15-16</a>. Of the worship of “images,” or “Teraphim,” we have traces in <a href="/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-30.htm" title="And now, though you would needs be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?">Genesis 31:30</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-34.htm" title="Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat on them.

Tradition asserts that Terah was a maker of idols, and that Abraham was persecuted in Ur of the Chaldees for refusing to take part in idolatries.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the people</span> (see note on Joshua 23:2). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of Israel.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">Jehovah, the God of Israel</span> (see <a href="/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13</a>). Until the vision to Moses, the God of Israel had no distinctive name. After that time Jehovah was the recognised name of the God of Israel, as Chemosh of the Moabites, Milcom of the Ammonites, Baal of the Phoenicians. Our translation, "the Lord," somewhat obscures this. <span class="cmt_word">Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">of the river.</span> Euphrates is meant, on the other side of which (see, however, note on last verse) lay Ur of the Chaldees. It is worthy of notice that there is no evidence of the growth of a myth in the narrative here. We have a simple abstract of the history given us in the Pentateuch, without the slightest addition, and certainly without the invention of any further miraculous details. All this goes to establish the position that we have here a simple unvarnished history of what occurred. The manufacture of prodigies, as every mythical history, down to the biographies of Dominic and Francis, tells us, is a process that cannot stand still. Each successive narrator deems it to be his duty to embellish his narrative with fresh marvels. Compare this with the historical abridgment before us, and we must at least acknowledge that we are in the presence of phenomena of a very different ruder. Professor Goldziher has argued, in his 'Mythology among the Hebrews,' that Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Jacob are solar myths, such as we find in immense abundance in Cox's 'Aryan Mythology.' Abraham (father of height)is the nightly sky. Sarah (princess) is the moon. Isaac (he shall laugh) is the smiling sunset or dawn. It would be difficult to find any history which, by an exercise of similar ingenuity, might not be resolved into myths. Napoleon Bonaparte, for instance, might be resolved into the rushing onset of the conqueror who was never defeated. The retreat from Moscow is a solar myth of the most obvious description. The battle of Bull's Run is clearly so named from the cowardice displayed there by the sons of John Bull. It is remarked by Mr. Tomkins that Ur, the city of the moon god, lends itself most naturally to the fabricator of myths. There is only one objection to the theory, and that is the bricks, still in existence, stamped with the words Urn, which compel us to descend from this delightful cloud land of fancy to the more sober regions of solid and literal fact (see 'Studies on the Times of Abraham,' pp. 205-207). In old time. Literally, <span class="accented">from everlasting, i.e</span>, from time immemorial, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The Rabbinic tradition has great probability in it, that Abraham was driven out of his native country for refusing to worship idols. It is difficult to understand his call otherwise. No doubt his great and pure soul had learned to abhor the idolatrous and cruel worship of his countrymen. By inward struggles, perhaps by the vague survival of the simpler and truer faith which has been held to underlie every polytheistic system, he had "reached a purer air," and learned to adore the One True God. His family were led to embrace his doctrines, and they left their native land with him. But Haran, with its star worship, was no resting place for him. So he journeyed on westward, leaving the society of men, and preserving himself from temptation by his nomad life. No wandering Bedouin, as some would have us believe (see Drew, 'Scripture Lands,' p. 18), but a prince, on equal terms with Abimelech and Pharaoh, and capable of overthrowing the mighty conqueror of Elam. Such an example might well be brought to the memory of his descendants, who were now to be sojourners in the land promised to their father. Guided by conscience alone, with every external influence against him, he had worshipped the true God in that land. No better argument could be offered to his descendants, when settled in that same land, and about to be bereft of that valuable support which they had derived from the life and influence of Joshua. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For this reason the Lord had driven out great and strong nations before the Israelites, so that no one was able to stand before them.

To this there is attached, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm">Joshua 23:11-13</a>, the admonition to take heed for the sake of their souls (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>), to love the Lord their God (on the love of God as the sum of the fulfilment of the law, see <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>). For if they turned, i.e., gave up the faithfulness they had hitherto displayed towards Jehovah, and attached themselves to the remnant of these nations, made marriages with them, and entered into fellowship with them, which the Lord had expressly forbidden (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), let them know that the Lord their God would not cut off these nations before them any more, but that they would be a snare and destruction to them. This threat is founded upon such passages of the law as <a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>, and more especially <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. The figure of a trap, which is employed here (see <a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>), is still further strengthened by &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, a snare (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>). Shotet, a whip or scourge, an emphatic form of the word derived from the poel of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, only occurs here. "Scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes" (see <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>). Joshua crowds his figures together to depict the misery and oppression which would be sure to result from fellowship with the Canaanites, because, from his knowledge of the fickleness of the people, and the wickedness of the human heart in its natural state, he could foresee that the apostasy of the nation from the Lord, which Moses had foretold, would take place but too quickly; as it actually did, according to <a href="/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>., in the very next generation. The words "until ye perish," etc., resume the threat held out by Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a> (cf. Josh Deu 28:21.). </body></html>
