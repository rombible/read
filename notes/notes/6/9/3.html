Their deception of Joshua and the Israelites on this occasion is a curious compensation for what was done by Simeon and Levi to the Hivites long before, when Jacob first came to Shechem from Padan-Aram (see Genesis 34). On that occasion, the inhabitants of a single city of the Hivites were put to the sword by Israel, by means of a stratagem; on this occasion, a stratagem saved four Hivite cities from destruction by Israel’s sword.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/joshua/9-3.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,...">Joshua 9:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when — </span>Rather, <span class="ital">but when; the inhabitants of Gibeon — </span>A great and royal city of the Hivites. <span class="ital">They made as if they had been ambassadors — </span>Sent from a far country. <span class="ital">Wine-bottles, old and rent, and bound up — </span>This seems scarce sense to us; but will appear clear enough when we recollect that glass bottles were not then known, but that bottles made of leather or skins were then used; and the Gibeonites, to make show of being come from a far country, brought with them such as were torn and rent, and bound about with strings or cords to keep them together.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:3-13 Other people heard these tidings, and were driven thereby to make war upon Israel; but the Gibeonites were led to make peace with them. Thus the discovery of the glory and the grace of God in the gospel, is to some a savour of life unto life, but to others a savour of death unto death, 2Co 2:16. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. The falsehood of the Gibeonites cannot be justified. We must not do evil that good may themselves to the God of Israel, we have reason to think Joshua would have been directed by the oracle of God to spare their lives. But when they had once said, We are come from a far country, they were led to say it made of skins, and their clothes: one lie brings on another, and that a third, and so on. The way of that sin is especially down-hill. Yet their faith and prudence are to be commended. In submitting to Israel they submitted to the God of Israel, which implied forsaking their idolatries. And how can we do better than cast ourselves upon the mercy of a God of all goodness? The way to avoid judgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us do like these Gibeonites, seek peace with God in the rags of abasement, and godly sorrow; so our sin shall not be our ruin. Let us be servants to Jesus, our blessed Joshua, and we shall live.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gibeon was the head of the four towns <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a> occupied by the Hivites <a href="/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>. The inhabitants were Amorites <a href="/2_samuel/21-2.htm">2 Samuel 21:2</a>; the name "Amorites" being used as a general name for the Canaanite population (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a> note). The Hivites seem to have had a non-monarchical form of government (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a>, <a href="/joshua/9-11.htm">Joshua 9:11</a>), but their city was <a href="/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a> in size and importance equal to those cities which the kings of the country made their capitals. Gibeon signifies "pertaining to a hill," i. e. built on a hill (compare Gibeah and Geba, towns in the same neighborhood), and describes the site, which is on two of the rounded hills unique to this district. It is still known as El-Jib, and lies about five miles north of Jerusalem by the most direct route. It stands at the head of the pass of Beth-horon, through which lies the main route from Jerusalem and the lower Jordan valley to Joppa and the sea coast. Thus from its position, no less than from the number and valor of its people <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>, it was one of the most important cities of southern Canaan. Gibeon fell within the lot of Benjamin <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>, and was one of the cities assigned to the priests <a href="/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>. In later times it was famous as the scene of various events (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-4.htm">2 Samuel 20:4-13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-29</a>, compare with <a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>). It was for a long time the spot where the tabernacle of Moses, together with the brass altar of burnt offering <a href="/1_chronicles/21-29.htm">1 Chronicles 21:29</a> and other portions of the sacred furniture, were placed. It was the scene of the magnificent ceremonial with which Solomon inaugurated his reign <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3.htm">1 Kings 3</a>, but no doubt lost much of its importance after the tabernacle and its accompaniments were removed to the temple of Solomon. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 9:3-15.

The name itself signifies “pertaining to a hill,” i.e. built on a hill, and describes the site, which is, by the direct route, about 5 miles north of Jerusalem, on two of the rounded hills peculiar to this neighbourhood. Placed at the head of the pass of Bethhoron, and commanding the main route from Jerusalem and the lower Jordan valley to Joppa and the sea-coast, and inhabited by a numerous and brave population, it was one of the most important cities of southern Canaan.

Gibeon was a city of some importance (<a href="/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). Though it was for size and importance "as one of the royal cities," we hear nothing of a king there. Hengstenberg, in his history, describes it (p. 227) as "eine freie Stadt," with daughter cities dependent on it. In fact, the Phoenician cities (see Introduction) seem to have had as great a variety of constitution as those of ancient Greece. Its inhabitants were Hivites (ver. 7, and <a href="/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>). Its name (compare Gibeah and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> a hill) signifies hill city, like the termination <span class="accented">dunum</span> in Latin, as Lugdunum, or Lyons; <span class="accented">dune</span> in Anglo-Saxon, as <span class="accented">Ethandune.</span> Compare also Dunkirk. Robinson, in his 'Biblical Researches,' 2:135-9, identifies it with el-Jib, a village on an eminence in the midst of a fertile plain, where the remains of large buildings may still be seen. (So Vandevelde and Condor.) "Onely the Hivites are wiser than their fellowes, and will rather yeeld and live. Their intelligence was not diverse from the rest; all had equally heard of the miraculous conduct and successe of Israel; but their resolution was diverse. As Rahab saved her family in the midst of Jericho, so these foure cities preserved themselves in the midst of Canaan; and both of them by beleeving what God would do. The efficacie of God's marvellous works is not in the acts themselves, but in our apprehension" (Bp. Hall). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"As Moses commanded:" namely, <a href="/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5</a>.

"Copy of the law:" as in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>; see the explanation at <a href="/deuteronomy/27-3.htm">Deuteronomy 27:3</a>. In connection with the third part of the ceremony the promulgation of the law with the blessing and cursing, the account of the Mosaic instructions given in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11</a>. is completed in <a href="/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a> by the statement that "all Israel, and their elders (i.e., with their elders), and shoterim, and judges," stood on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests, the stranger as well as the native, i.e., without any exception, one half (i.e., six tribes) towards Mount Ebal, and the other half towards Mount Gerizim. For further remarks, see at <a href="/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11</a>. "As Moses commanded to bless the people before:" i.e., as he had previously commanded. The fact that the thought itself does not suit the context is quite sufficient to show that the explanation given by many commentators, viz., that they were to commence with the blessings, is incorrect. But if, on the other hand, we connect the word "before" with the principal verb of the sentence, "commanded," the meaning will be that Moses did not give the command to proclaim the blessings and cursings to the people for the first time in connection with these instructions (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>), but had done so before, at the very outset, namely, as early as <a href="/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a>.</body></html>
