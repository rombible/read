Thus the discovery of the glory and the grace of God in the gospel, is to some a savour of life unto life, but to others a savour of death unto death, 2Co 2:16. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. The falsehood of the Gibeonites cannot be justified. We must not do evil that good may themselves to the God of Israel, we have reason to think Joshua would have been directed by the oracle of God to spare their lives. But when they had once said, We are come from a far country, they were led to say it made of skins, and their clothes: one lie brings on another, and that a third, and so on. The way of that sin is especially down-hill. Yet their faith and prudence are to be commended. In submitting to Israel they submitted to the God of Israel, which implied forsaking their idolatries. And how can we do better than cast ourselves upon the mercy of a God of all goodness? The way to avoid judgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us do like these Gibeonites, seek peace with God in the rags of abasement, and godly sorrow; so our sin shall not be our ruin. Let us be servants to Jesus, our blessed Joshua, and we shall live.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us&#8212;The answer of the Israelites implied that they had no discretion, that their orders were imperative, and that if the strangers belonged to any of the native tribes, the idea of an alliance with them was unlawful since God had forbidden it (Ex 23:32; 34:12; De 7:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Hivites, </span> i.e. the Gibeonites, who were Hivites, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/11-19.htm" title="There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.">Joshua 11:19</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Among us, </span> i.e. in this land, and so are of that people with whom we are forbidden to make any league or covenant, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm" title="You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.">Exodus 23:32</a>,33 Deu 7:2 20:15,16</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites,....

The news of the miraculous passage of the Israelites through the Jordan had thrown all the kings of Canaan into such despair, that they did not venture to make any attack upon Israel. But they gradually recovered from their first panic, partly, no doubt, in consequence of the failure of the first attack of the Israelites upon Ai, and resolved to join together in making war upon the foreign invaders. The kings of Canaan did this when they heard, sc., what Israel had hitherto undertaken and accomplished, not merely "what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai" (Knobel): that is to say, all the kings across the Jordan, i.e., in the country to the west of the Jordan (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, as in <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>), viz., "upon the mountains" (not only the mountains of Judah, as in <a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a>, etc., but all the mountains which run throughout the whole length of Canaan, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a> and <a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a> : see the explanation of the latter passage); "in the lowlands" (shephelah, the low-lying country between the mountains and the sea-coast, which is simply intersected by small ranges of hills; see at <a href="/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>); "and on all the coast of the Great Sea towards Lebanon," i.e., the narrow coast of the Mediterranean Sea from Joppa up to the Ladder of Tyre (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>). The different tribes of the Canaanites are also mentioned by name, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>, except that the Girgashites are omitted. These gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one mouth, or with one accord (<a href="/1_kings/22-13.htm">1 Kings 22:13</a>). </body></html>
