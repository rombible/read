We make more haste than good speed, when we stay not to take God with us, and do not consult him by the word and prayer. The fraud was soon found out. A lying tongue is but for a moment. Had the oath been in itself unlawful, it would not have been binding; for no obligation can render it our duty to commit a sin. But it was not unlawful to spare the Canaanites who submitted, and left idolatry, desiring only that their lives might be spared. A citizen of Zion swears to his own hurt, and changes not, Ps 15:4. Joshua and the princes, when they found that they had been deceived, did not apply to Eleazar the high priest to be freed from their engagement, much less did they pretend that no faith is to be kept with those to whom they had sworn.

The princes of the congregation did not vindicate either the expediency or the lawfulness of the connection they had formed; but they felt the solemn obligations of their oath; and, although the popular clamor was loud against them, caused either by disappointment at losing the spoils of Gibeon, or by displeasure at the apparent breach of the divine commandment, they determined to adhere to their pledge, "because they had sworn by the Lord God of Israel." The Israelitish princes acted conscientiously; they felt themselves bound by their solemn promise; but to prevent the disastrous consequences of their imprudent haste, they resolved to degrade the Gibeonites to a servile condition as a means of preventing their people from being ensnared into idolatry, and thus acted up, as they thought, to the true spirit and end of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Let them be public servants, and employed in the meanest offices and drudgeries, (such as this was, this one kind being put for all the rest, as it is <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/29-11.htm" title="Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water:">Deu 29:11</a></span>) for the use and benefit of the congregation; to do this partly <span class="ital">for</span> the sacrifices and services of <span class="ital">the house of God</span>, as it is expressed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/9-23.htm" title="Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being slaves, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.">Joshua 9:23</a></span>, which otherwise the Israelites themselves must have done, partly for the service of the camp or body of the people, and sometimes upon occasion even to particular Israelites; whence they are made <span class="ital">bondmen</span>, which is mentioned as a filing distinct from their service <span class="ital">in the house of God</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/9-23.htm" title="Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being slaves, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.">Joshua 9:23</a></span>.

So the princes speaking here to the people allege the promise or oath of the princes when they met among themselves, and apart from the people.

The LXX. and Vulgate render as our version. <span class="cmt_word">Hewers of wood and drawers of water.</span> Some amount of casuistry has been displayed upon this passage. But the fairness of the proceeding seems clear enough. The Gibeonites had escaped death by a fraud. For that fraud they deserved punishment. Their lives were spared by virtue of a solemn oath. But equality of rights had never been promised them. They might think themselves well off if they escaped destruction, even though they might be condemned permanently to occupy a servile condition. They appear to have assisted at the tabernacle worship, since they were condemned to serve, not individual Israelites, but the congregation. Such was the office of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (Nethinhim <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the given or devoted) in the later history of Judah (see <a href="/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43-54, 58, 70</a>; and Ezra 8:20. See also Drusius and Masius <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The latter discusses the question whether the Nethinim were really the Gibeonites, or whether David, as stated in <a href="/ezra/8-20.htm">Ezra 8:20</a>, instituted a new order of persons to take their place. If the latter were the case, then we have a proof that the Book of Joshua was written anterior to the time of David. It seems quite possible that Saul (<a href="/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>) had all but exterminated the Gibeonites, and that David was compelled to institute a new order in their stead. If this suggestion be correct, and it is far from improbable, we have here an undesigned coincidence strongly supporting the credit of the narrative, in the place of Knobel's insinuation, contained in the words, that "the Elohist in Saul's time gives no hint of this, although he took the greatest interest in the persons engaged in God's service." <span class="cmt_word">As the princes had promised them.</span> These words as they stand are unintelligible. No such promise had been given. The literal rendering is "as the princes" (see note on ver. 15) "said to them," by the mouth of Joshua, as recorded in ver. 23. The Syriac Version supplies some words here to make up for a supposed deficiency in the text. But this is not necessary. The repetition in vers. 23 and 27 is quite in the manner of the historian. Nor are the words "as the princes said to them" explicable on the supposition that the words after, "let them live," are the words of the princes (see note above). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>So Joshua made (granted) them peace (vid., <a href="/isaiah/27-5.htm">Isaiah 27:5</a>), and concluded a covenant with them (&#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, in their favour), to let them live; and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. Letting them live is the only article of the league that is mentioned, both because this was the main point, and also with special reference to the fact that the Gibeonites, being Canaanites, ought properly to have been destroyed. It is true that Joshua and the princes of the congregation had not violated any express command of God by doing this; for the only thing prohibited in the law was making treaties with the Canaanites, which they did not suppose the Gibeonites to be, whilst in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-11.htm">Deuteronomy 20:11</a>, where wars with foreign nations (not Canaanites) are referred to, permission is given to make peace with them, so that all treaties with foreign nations are not forbidden. But they had failed in this respect, that, trusting to the crafty words of the Gibeonites, and to outward appearances only, they had forgotten their attitude to the Lord their God who had promised to His congregation, in all important matters, a direct revelation of His own will. </body></html>
