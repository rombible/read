And the fear was not merely of the power of man; one might flee from that to the Divine protection; but of the power of God himself, which they saw engaged against them. Joshua sentences them to perpetual bondage. They must be servants, but any work becomes honourable, when it is done for the house of the Lord, and the offices thereof. Let us, in like manner, submit to our Lord Jesus, saying, We are in thy hand, do unto us as seemeth good and right unto thee, only save our souls; and we shall not repent it. If He appoints us to bear his cross, and serve him, that shall be neither shame nor grief to us, while the meanest office in God's service will entitle us to a dwelling in the house of the Lord all the days of our life. And in coming to the Saviour, we do not proceed upon a peradventure. We are invited to draw nigh, and are assured that him that cometh to Him, he will in nowise cast out. Even those things which sound harsh, and are humbling, and form sharp trials of our sincerity, will prove of real advantage.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were the Israelites bound to respect an oath thus procured by fraud? Were they right in doing so? Dr. Sanderson ("Works," vol. iv. 4 pp. 269, 300, Oxford edition), determines these questions in the affirmative; and rightly, since the oath, though unlawfully taken, was not an oath taken to do an unlawful thing, i. e. a thing in itself unlawful. It was the carelessness of the Israelites themselves which betrayed them into this league. It was therefore their duty when they found themselves entrapped into this unlawful covenant, to devise means by which they might respect both their own oath and God's purposes as intimated in His injunctions <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a> against sparing the Canaanites. This was accomplished by granting their lives to the Gibeonites, but reducing them to a servile condition, which might be expected to disable them from influencing the Israelites to do wrong. It may be added, that had the Israelites broken their oath, taken solemnly in the Name of the Lord, they would have brought that Name into contempt among the pagan; and, while punishing perfidy in others, would have themselves, the Lord's people, incurred the reproach of perjury. The result showed that Joshua and the princes judged rightly in this matter. God gave to Israel a notable victory, crowned with special miracles, over the kings who were confederated against Gibeon, because of the treaty made with Israel <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-4.htm">Joshua 10:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>,<a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>; and God punished as a national act of blood-guiltiness the slaughter of the Gibeonites by Saul, which was a distinct violation of the covenant here before us (compare <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>). This sparing of the Gibeonites, as well as the previous sparing of Rahab and her household, must be borne in mind when the massacre of the Canaanites by Joshua and the Israelites is discussed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-27. the children of Israel smote them not&#8212;The moral character of the Gibeonites' stratagem was bad. The princes of the congregation did not vindicate either the expediency or the lawfulness of the connection they had formed; but they felt the solemn obligations of their oath; and, although the popular clamor was loud against them, caused either by disappointment at losing the spoils of Gibeon, or by displeasure at the apparent breach of the divine commandment, they determined to adhere to their pledge, "because they had sworn by the Lord God of Israel." The Israelitish princes acted conscientiously; they felt themselves bound by their solemn promise; but to prevent the disastrous consequences of their imprudent haste, they resolved to degrade the Gibeonites to a servile condition as a means of preventing their people from being ensnared into idolatry, and thus acted up, as they thought, to the true spirit and end of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joshua called for them,....

They set out therefore to deal with the deceivers, and reached their towns Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim on the third day. "Chephirah, which was afterwards allotted to the tribe of Benjamin along with Gibeon and Beeroth, and was still inhabited after the captivity (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25-26</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-25.htm">Ezra 2:25</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-29.htm">Nehemiah 7:29</a>), is to be seen in the ruins of Kefir, an hour's journey to the east of Yalo, in the mountains, and three hours to the west of Gibeon (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 146, and Van de Velde, Memoir, pp. 303-4). Beeroth, &#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;, according to Eusebius (Onom. s. v.) a hamlet near Jerusalem, and seven miles on the road to Nicopolis (it should read Neapolis), was in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2</a>), and still exists in the large village of Bireh, which is situated upon a mountain nine Roman miles to the north of Jerusalem in a stony and barren district, and has still several springs and a good well, besides the remains of a fine old church of the time of the Crusades (see Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 130ff.; Seetzen, R. ii. pp. 195-6). Kirjath-jearim, also called Kirjath-baal (<a href="/joshua/15-60.htm">Joshua 15:60</a>), Baalah (<a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a>), and Baal-Jehuda (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>), was allotted to the tribe of Judah. It stood upon the boundary between Judah and Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/15-60.htm">Joshua 15:60</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-15.htm">Joshua 18:15</a>); and the ark remained there, after it had been sent back by the Philistines, until the time of David (<a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5-6</a>). According to the Onom., s. v. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc; and &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;, it was nine or ten Roman miles from Jerusalem, on the road to Diospolis (Lydda), and is probably to be seen in the present Kuryet el Enab, a considerable village with a large number of olive trees, figs, pomegranates, and vineyards, from the last of which the old "town of the forests" has received the more modern name of "town of the vine" (see Rob. Pal. ii. p. 335, and Bibl. Res. pp. 156-7; and Seetzen, ii. p. 65). These towns, which formed one republic with Gibeon, and were governed by elders, were at so short a distance from Gilgal (Jiljilia), that the Israelites could reach it in one or two days. The expression "on the third day" is not at variance with this; for it is not stated that Israel took three days to march there, but simply that they arrived there on the third day after receiving the intelligence of the arrival of the ambassadors. </body></html>
