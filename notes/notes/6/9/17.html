The fact that the larger portion of the territory of the Gibeonites was in the tribe of Benjamin explains how Saul was tempted to confiscate their possessions for the purpose of supplying his followers with fields and vineyards (<a href="/1_samuel/22-7.htm" title="Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;">1Samuel 22:7</a>). He appears to have carried out his purpose in the case of Beeroth (<a href="/context/2_samuel/4-2.htm" title="And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.">2Samuel 4:2-3</a>), but not as regards all the Gibeonite towns.

(See <a href="/1_samuel/6-21.htm" title="And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come you down, and fetch it up to you.">1Samuel 6:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.">1Samuel 7:1</a>, &c.; 1 Chron. 20:29; and <a href="/context/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2Chronicles 1:3-6</a>.) The fact that the Gibeonites were dedicated to the service of the sanctuary may partly account for this. In Gibeon, Solomon asked and received the wisdom which Joshua and Israel at this time did not ask.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:14-21 The Israelites, having examined the provisions of the Gibeonites, hastily concluded that they confirmed their account. We make more haste than good speed, when we stay not to take God with us, and do not consult him by the word and prayer. The fraud was soon found out. A lying tongue is but for a moment. Had the oath been in itself unlawful, it would not have been binding; for no obligation can render it our duty to commit a sin. But it was not unlawful to spare the Canaanites who submitted, and left idolatry, desiring only that their lives might be spared. A citizen of Zion swears to his own hurt, and changes not, Ps 15:4. Joshua and the princes, when they found that they had been deceived, did not apply to Eleazar the high priest to be freed from their engagement, much less did they pretend that no faith is to be kept with those to whom they had sworn. Let this convince us how we ought to keep our promises, and make good our bargains; and what conscience we ought to make of our words.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Chephirah (Kefir) is situated eight or nine miles west of Gibeon, and was an inhabited city in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah Ezr 2:25; <a href="/nehemiah/7-29.htm">Nehemiah 7:29</a>.<p>Beeroth (Birch), about eight miles north of Jerusalem. Kirjath-jearim, i. e. "city of woods," is identified by Robinson with the modern Kuriet el Enab, nine miles from Jerusalem on the road to Jaffa (and by Conder with Soba). The town was numbered among those belonging to Judah, and was in the northern boundary of that tribe.

So also Vaudcvelde and Conder). Jerome identified it with a place only seven miles from Jerusalem, which is an obvious error. It contains nearly 700 inhabitants, and is only about twenty minutes' walk from el-Jib, or Gibeon. Kirjath-jearim (the name means <span class="accented">the city of forests</span>) is well known in the history of Israel (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a>). But it is, chiefly remarkable for the twenty years sojourn of the ark there (<a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>). It was also known by the name of Baalah, Kirjath-Baal (<a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9, 60</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>). The Hivites seem to have been removed thence (probably to Gibeon), for there is no trace of any non-Jewish element in the population in the account of the reception of the ark among them (see <a href="/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a>.). It is called Baale of Judah in <a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a> (cf. <a href="/joshua/18-15.htm">Joshua 18:15</a>). The Jewish population seems to be due to one of the posterity of Caleb (see <a href="/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50-53</a>). Modern explorers, with the exception of Lieut. Conder, have identified Kirjath-jearim with Kuriet-el-Enab, "the city of the grape," about four miles from el-Jib, or Gibeon. This is the opinion of Robinson and Vandevelde. Supposing it to be near Beth-shemesh, on the authority of Josephus, Lieut. Conder places it at 'Arma, west of Bethlehem, and identifies the waters of Nepbtoah with a fountain nearly due south of the valley of giants or Rephaim (see <a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a>). But this is too far from Gibeon. He identifies Kuriet-el-Enab with Kirjath in <a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>, and regards this as one of the cities of Benjamin within the border. But this Kirjath may be Kirjath-jearim, and may as reasonably, standing on the border, be accounted to belong to both tribes, as Zorah, Eshtaol (mentioned in the boundaries of Judah and Dan), Beth-arahah, possibly Gibeah or Gibeath (belonging to Judah and Benjamin), and even Jerusalem itself (see <a href="/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>). The identification of Kirjath-jearim with Kuriet-el-Enab, of the waters of Nephtoah with Ain Lifta, giving a line running northwestward from the valley of Rephaim, seems more probable as the border of Judah and Benjamin, and the word "compassed," or rather deflected, adds probability to this interpretation (see <a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9, 10</a>, and notes). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When these tidings reached them, they were sent off by the elders (the leaders of the republic) and the inhabitants of the land to meet the Israelites, that they might offer them their service, and form an alliance with them.
