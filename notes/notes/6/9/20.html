We make more haste than good speed, when we stay not to take God with us, and do not consult him by the word and prayer. The fraud was soon found out. A lying tongue is but for a moment. Had the oath been in itself unlawful, it would not have been binding; for no obligation can render it our duty to commit a sin. But it was not unlawful to spare the Canaanites who submitted, and left idolatry, desiring only that their lives might be spared. A citizen of Zion swears to his own hurt, and changes not, Ps 15:4. Joshua and the princes, when they found that they had been deceived, did not apply to Eleazar the high priest to be freed from their engagement, much less did they pretend that no faith is to be kept with those to whom they had sworn. Let this convince us how we ought to keep our promises, and make good our bargains; and what conscience we ought to make of our words.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Chephirah (Kefir) is situated eight or nine miles west of Gibeon, and was an inhabited city in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah Ezr 2:25; <a href="/nehemiah/7-29.htm">Nehemiah 7:29</a>.<p>Beeroth (Birch), about eight miles north of Jerusalem. Kirjath-jearim, i. e. "city of woods," is identified by Robinson with the modern Kuriet el Enab, nine miles from Jerusalem on the road to Jaffa (and by Conder with Soba). The town was numbered among those belonging to Judah, and was in the northern boundary of that tribe. Beyond this city the six hundred Danites encamped on their famous expedition to Laish <a href="/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a>. Kirjath-jearim was also, and probably before the Israelite conquests exclusively, called Baalah and Kirjath-baal <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-60.htm">Joshua 15:60</a>, names which seem to point to its early sanctity as a special seat of Baal-worship. To this place also the ark was brought from Beth-shemesh after it was sent back by the Philistines, and here it remained for twenty years <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-20.htm">1 Samuel 6:20-21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>.

The princes of the congregation did not vindicate either the expediency or the lawfulness of the connection they had formed; but they felt the solemn obligations of their oath; and, although the popular clamor was loud against them, caused either by disappointment at losing the spoils of Gibeon, or by displeasure at the apparent breach of the divine commandment, they determined to adhere to their pledge, "because they had sworn by the Lord God of Israel." The Israelitish princes acted conscientiously; they felt themselves bound by their solemn promise; but to prevent the disastrous consequences of their imprudent haste, they resolved to degrade the Gibeonites to a servile condition as a means of preventing their people from being ensnared into idolatry, and thus acted up, as they thought, to the true spirit and end of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This we will do to them,.... Either this favour we will show them, preserving their lives, next mentioned, or this punishment we will inflict on them, making them hewers of wood, and drawers of water; which though not mentioned directly, was what was upon their minds, and in their design to propose, only they were extremely desirous of sparing their lives, which they repeat: <p>we will even let them live; this by all means must be done, their lives must not be taken away as the rest of the Canaanites: <p>lest wrath come upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them; that is, lest the wrath of God come upon us princes, and upon the whole community, for perjury, a breach of the third command, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, a sin highly displeasing to God; since an oath is made not only in his presence, and before him as a witness, who is appealed unto, but in his name, and is often severely threatened, and sorely punished; and as even the breach of this oath was several hundreds of years after, in the times of David, <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>. The Vulgate Latin version therefore reads the words, "lest the wrath of the Lord come upon us": but Abarbinel observes, that it may be understood of the wrath of Israel; for the words may be rendered, "and there shall not be wrath upon us, because of the oath": there need be none, there is no occasion for it, since this was agreed upon on all hands, that the Gibeonites should be let to live; and since it was an act of kindness and goodness, and especially they would have no reason to be angry and wrathful with them, when they heard them out, what they had further to propose to them, to make them their servants, though they spared their lives. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> oath which we sware unto them.</span><p>(k) This does not establish rash oaths, but shows God's mercy toward his, who would not punish them for their sin.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest wrath be upon us.</span> The original is not quite so strong: "and wrath will not be upon us (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>, LXX.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Israelites suffered themselves to be taken in by this pretence. "The men (the elders of Israel) took of their provisions; but they did not ask the mouth of the Lord." Instead of inquiring the will of the Lord in this matter through the Urim and Thummim of the high priest (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>), they contented themselves with taking some of the bread that was shown them, and tasting it; as if the dry mouldy bread furnished a safe guarantee of the truth of the words of these foreign ambassadors. Some commentators regard their taking of their provisions as a sign of mutual friendship, or of the league which they made; but in that case their eating with them would at any rate have been mentioned. Among the Arabs, simply eating bread and salt with a guest is considered a sign of peace and friendship.</body></html>
