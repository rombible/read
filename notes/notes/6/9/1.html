The fulfilment of these instructions, according to the meaning of this solemn act, as a symbolical setting up of the law of the Lord to be the invariable rule of life to the people of Israel in the land of Canaan (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>), was not only a practical expression of thanksgiving on the part of the covenant nation for its entrance into this land through the almighty assistance of its God, but also a practical acknowledgement, that in the overthrow of the Canaanites thus far it had received a strong pledge of the conquest of the foes that still remained and the capture of the whole of the promised land, provided only it persevered in covenant faithfulness towards the Lord its God. The account of this transaction is attached, it is true, to the conquest of Ai by the introduction, "Then Joshua built," etc. (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a>); but simply as an occurrence which had no logical connection with the conquest of Canaan and the defeat of its kings. The particle &#1488;&#1494; (sequ. imperf.) is used, for example, in cases where the historian either wishes to introduce contemporaneous facts, that do not carry forward the main course of the history, or loses sight for the time of the strictly historical sequence and simply takes note of the occurrence of some particular event (vid., Ewald, 136, b.). The assertion of modern critics, which Knobel repeats, that this account is out of place in the series of events as contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6-12</a>, is so far correct, that the promulgation of the law and the renewal of the covenant upon Ebal form no integral part of the account of the conquest of Canaan; but it by no means proves that this section has been interpolated by the Jehovist from his first document, or by the last editor of this book from some other source, and that what is related here did not take place at the time referred to. The circumstance that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6-8</a>:29, Joshua had only effected the conquest of Jericho in the south of the land from Gilgal as a base, and that even in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9-10</a> he was still engaged in the south, by no means involves the impossibility or even the improbability of a march to Shechem, which was situated further north, where he had not yet beaten the Canaanites, and had not effected any conquests. The distance from Ai to Shechem between Gerizim and Ebal is about thirty miles in a straight line. Robinson made the journey from Bireh (Beeroth) to Sichem on mules in eleven and a half hours, and that not by the most direct route (Pal. iii. pp. 81-2), and Ai was not more than an hour to the south of Beeroth; so that Joshua could have gone with the people from Ai to Gerizim and Ebal in two days without any excessive exertion. Now, even if the conquests of the Israelites had not extended further north than Ai at that time, there was no reason why Joshua should be deterred from advancing further into the land by any fear of attack from the Canaanites, as the people of war who went with him would be able to repulse any hostile attack; and after the news had spread of the fate of Ai and Jericho, no Canaanitish king would be likely to venture upon a conflict with the Israelites alone. Moreover, Shechem had no king, as we may gather from the list of the thirty-one kings who were defeated by Joshua. To the further remark of Knobel, that "there was no reason for their hurrying with this ceremony, and it might have been carried out at a later period in undisturbed security," we simply reply, that obedience to the command of God was not a matter of such indifference to the servant of the Lord as Knobel imagines. There was no valid reason after the capture of Ai for postponing any longer the solemn ceremony of setting up the law of Jehovah which had been enjoined by Moses; and if we consider the reason for this solemnity, to which we have already referred, there can be no doubt that Joshua would proceed without the least delay to set up the law of the Lord in Canaan as early as possible, even before the subjugation of the whole land, that he might thereby secure the help of God for further conflicts and enterprises.<p>The account of this religious solemnity is given very briefly. It presupposes an acquaintance with the Mosaic instructions in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>, and merely gives the leading points, to show that those instructions were carefully carried out by Joshua. Of the three distinct acts of which the ceremony consisted, in the book of Deuteronomy the setting up of the stones with the law written upon them is mentioned first (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2-4</a>), and then (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-5.htm">Joshua 8:5-7</a>) the building of the altar and the offering of sacrifice. Here, on the contrary, the building of the altar and offering of sacrifice are mentioned first (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a>, <a href="/joshua/8-31.htm">Joshua 8:31</a>), and then (<a href="/joshua/8-32.htm">Joshua 8:32</a>) the writing of the law upon the stones; which was probably the order actually observed. - In <a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a> Jehovah is called "the God of Israel," to show that henceforth no other god was to be worshipped in Canaan than the God of Israel. On Mount Ebal, see at <a href="/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>.</body></html>
