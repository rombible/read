God's spiritual Israel have, and shall have in Christ and heaven, not only rest to repose in, but refuge to secure themselves in. These cities were designed to typify the relief which the gospel provides for penitent sinners, and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in our Lord Jesus, to whom believers flee for refuge, Heb 6:18.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nothing is said of any express command of God respecting the inheritance of Joshua. But as such special portion appears to have been promised to Caleb at the time when he and Joshua alone out of the twelve spies remained faithful <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6-9</a>, it is probable that a like promise was made to Joshua. The name of the place is also written Timnath-heres <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>, by a transposition of the letters. The rabbinical explanation that the name Timnath-heres (i. e. "portion of the sun") was given because a representation of the sun was affixed to the tomb in memory of Joshua's command to the sun to stand still, appears to be an afterthought. The name Timnath-serah ("portion that remains") was perhaps conferred on the spot in consequence of its being allotted to Joshua, the last allotment made in the whole distribution of his conquests. The site has been conjectured to be "Tibneh," a village about five miles north-west of Lydda (or, by Conder, Kerr Hares, nine miles south of Nablous). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 20<p>Jos 20:1-6. The Lord Commands the Cities of Refuge.<p>1-3. The Lord spake unto Joshua &#8230; Appoint out for you cities of refuge&#8212;(See Nu 35:9-28; De 19:1-13). The command here recorded was given on their going to occupy their allotted settlements. The sanctuaries were not temples or altars, as in other countries, but inhabited cities; and the design was not to screen criminals, but only to afford the homicide protection from the vengeance of the deceased's relatives until it should have been ascertained whether the death had resulted from accident and momentary passion, or from premeditated malice. The institution of the cities of refuge, together with the rules prescribed for the guidance of those who sought an asylum within their walls, was an important provision, tending to secure the ends of justice as well as of mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The possessions being now divided among you, do you reserve some of them for the use which I have commanded. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Speak to the children of Israel, saying,....

Prior to the Mosaic age, it was required of the nearest of kin, as a matter of duty, to avenge the death of a slain relative. He was called the <span class="ital">Goel</span> or <span class="ital">Avenger</span>, and together with his office inherited the property of the deceased. Sometimes a whole family took upon them this duty (<a href="/2_samuel/14-7.htm" title="And, behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the earth.">2 Samuel 14:7</a>). Among the Arab tribes of the present day, “any bloodshed whatever, whether wilful or accidental, laid the homicide open to the <span class="ital">duteous</span> revenge of the relatives and family of the slain person, who again in their turn were then similarly watched and hunted by the opposite party, until a family war of extermination had legally settled itself from generation to generation, without the least prospect of a peaceful termination.” It was the aim of the Mosaic Law, without altogether abolishing this long-established custom, to mitigate its evils as far as possible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whereof I spake unto you</span>] The general directions on this subject will be found in (<span class="ital">a</span>) <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm" title="And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.">Exodus 21:13</a>; (<span class="ital">b</span>) <a href="/numbers/35-9.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 35:9</a> ff.; (<span class="ital">c</span>) <a href="/deuteronomy/19-2.htm" title="You shall separate three cities for you in the middle of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Deuteronomy 19:2</a>.

Res. pp. 390, 393). It was there that Jeroboam set up the golden calves (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29-30</a>, etc.); and it is frequently mentioned as the northernmost city of the Israelites, in contrast with Beersheba, which was in the extreme south of the land (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a> : see also Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 207ff.). </body></html>
