Our version, by its renderings, obscures the beautiful precision with which our historian never fails to hit off the physical geography of the country. Thus, the plain of Bashan, Gilead, and Reuben is always the Mishor; the strip of land between the mountains and the Mediterranean is always the Shephelah; the depression of the Jordan Valley and the country south of the Dead Sea is invariably the Arabah; wide plains shut in between ranges of hills or situated on their slopes are distinguished by the title of Emek; while narrow waterless ravines are known by the name of Ge. We may quote here the emphatic words with which Canon Tristram concludes his 'Land of Israel,' "While on matters of science the inspired writers speak in the ordinary language of their times (the only language which could have been understood), I can bear testimony to the minute truth of innumerable incidental allusions in Holy Writ to the facts of nature, of climate, of geographical position - corroborations of Scripture which, though trifling in themselves, reach to minute details that prove the writers to have lived when and where they are asserted to have lived; which attest their scrupulous accuracy in recording what they saw and observed around them; and which, therefore, must increase our confidence in their veracity, where we cannot have the like means of testing it. I can find no discrepancies between their geographical or physical statements and the evidence of present facts. I can find no standpoint here for the keenest advocate against the full inspiration of the scriptural record. The Holy Land not only elucidates but bears witness to the truth of the Holy Book." <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth in Gilead.</span> See <a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>, where it is called Ramoth Mizpeh; also <a href="/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>. All these cities of refuge were Levitical cities. It is famous as the headquarters of Jehu's rebellion, in which he clearly had the support of the priestly party (<a href="/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9</a>.). The key to his subsequent conduct is found in this fact. His "zeal for the Lord," displayed so ostentatiously to Jonadab, who we may suppose, as being of the "family of the scribes," to have become identified with the Levites (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a> with <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, and <a href="/1_chronicles/27-32.htm">1 Chronicles 27:32</a> with <a href="/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>), was simply a stroke of policy, to bind to his interest the sacerdotal party, to whom,with the army, he owed his throne. Just such a policy commended itself to the worldly wisdom of our own Lancastrian princes, and led to the enactment of the infamous statute de <span class="accented">heretico comburendo in</span> the fifteenth century. Jehu, we find, was contented with the one vast sacrifice of idolaters, for whom he cared nothing, and gave himself no further trouble to secure purity of worship for his people. The one great value of the geographical and political details in the book of Joshua is that when carefully studied they supply us with the key to many a mystery in the after history of Israel, which, but for their aid, we should scarcely have unravelled. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the distribution of the land by lot among the tribes of Israel, six towns were set apart, in accordance with the Mosaic instructions in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>, as places of refuge for unintentional manslayers.
