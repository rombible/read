A list is given of the kings subdued by Israel: thirty-one in all. This shows how fruitful Canaan then was, in which so many chose to throng together. This was the land God appointed for Israel; yet in our day it is one of the most barren and unprofitable countries in the world. Such is the effect of the curse it lies under, since its possessors rejected Christ and his gospel, as was foretold by Moses, De 29:23. The vengeance of a righteous God, inflicted on all these kings and their subjects, for their wickedness, should make us dread and hate sin. The fruitful land bestowed on his chosen people, should fill our hearts with hope and confidence in his mercy, and with humble gratitude.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The identification of several of these places is still uncertain: the same name (e. g.

The limestone cliffs of the locality are pierced with extensive caverns, one of which is famous as the refuge of David (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm" title="David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.">1 Samuel 22:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm" title="And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.">2 Samuel 23:13</a>). The city was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm" title="And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). Adullam has been traditionally identified with a place called <span class="ital">Khureitun</span>, where is a great cave which has been explored by Captain Warren and Lieutenant Conder. Later writers are inclined to place it at Deir Dubbân, about six miles north of <span class="ital">Beit Jibrîn</span> (Eleutheropolis). M. Clermont Ganneau, however, was the first to discover the site of Adullam and the existing name of <span class="ital">Ayd el Mieh</span>, which preserves all the essential letters of the Hebrew. Lieutenant Conder has now made a careful survey of the spot. He finds the ruins of an ancient town (<a href="/genesis/38-1.htm" title="And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.">Genesis 38:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/38-12.htm" title="And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.">Genesis 38:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/38-20.htm" title="And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.">Genesis 38:20</a>), strongly situated (<a href="/joshua/12-15.htm" title="The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;">Joshua 12:15</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm" title="And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>) on a height commanding the broad valley of Elah, which was the highway by which the Philistines invaded Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/17-19.htm" title="Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.">1 Samuel 17:19</a>), and where David killed Goliath. Roads connect it with Hebron, Bethlehem, and Tell es Safiyeh—the probable site of Gath. There are terraces of the hill for cultivation, scarped rock for fortification, tombs, wells, and aqueducts. The “Cave” is a series of caves, some of moderate size and some small, but quite capable of housing David’s band of followers.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Adullam</span>. In the Shephelah (<span class="accented">valley</span> in our version. See ch. 15:33-35). Canon Tristram in his 'Bible Lands,' as well as Conder in his 'Handbook,' identify this with Aid-el-Me, or Mich. In the Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund for July, 1875 (see also Jan., 1874), Lieut. Conder details a visit to this place, previously identified by M. Clermont-Ganneau. These explorers reject the idea approved by Vandevelde and others, that this Deir Dabban is the ancient Adullam. The place he prefers fulfils all requirements. It is in the Shephelah. It is near Jarmuth and Socoh. It is an ancient site with "rock cut tombs, good water supply, and main road, and communications from different sides, and it is moreover a strong military position. It contains no remarkable cave, but a number of small ones, now used as habitations by the peasantry." Keilah, which David saved from the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1-5</a>), was within a reasonable distance. The present name, Aid-el-Me or Mieh, the feast of the hundred, may be a misapprehension of the word Adullam similar to that which converts the Welsh "yr eifel," in Carnarvonshire, into the English "the rivals," or which identifies in many English names the English <span class="accented">burn</span> (brook) with the French <span class="accented">borne</span> (boundary). One of the greatest objections to the theory is that the Hebrew so frequently speaks of the place as Cave-Adullam (Ma'arah-Adullam), as though some special cave existed there. Adullam plays a somewhat important part in Scripture history. We hear of it as early as <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>, where Hirah the Adullamite is spoken of as a friend of the patriarch Judah.. It is well known as the refuge of David and his mighty men (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13-17</a>). It was the place where David composed two of his psalms, the 57th and the 142nd. Rehoboam fortified it (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). It seems to be regarded as a refuge in <a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. And it is mentioned among the cities re-occupied after the return from the captivity in <a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The different kings are given in the order in which they were defeated: Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>); Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>); Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon (<a href="/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>); Gezer (<a href="/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>); and Debir (<a href="/joshua/10-38.htm">Joshua 10:38</a>). Those given in <a href="/joshua/12-13.htm">Joshua 12:13</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a> are not mentioned by name in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10.htm">Joshua 10</a>. Geder, possibly the same as Gedor upon the mountains of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>), which has been preserved under the old name of Jedur (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 186, and Bibl. Res. p. 282). Hormah (i.e., banning) was in the south of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-30.htm">Joshua 15:30</a>), and was allotted to the Simeonites (<a href="/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>). It was called Zephath by the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>; see at <a href="/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>), was on the southern slope of the mountains of the Amalekites or Amorites, the present ruins of Septa, on the western slope of the table-land of Rakhma, two hours and a half to the south-west of Khalasa (Elusa: see Ritter, Erdk. xiv. p. 1085). Arad, also in the Negeb, has been preserved in Tell Arad (see at <a href="/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>). Libnah (see at <a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>). Adullam, which is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a> among the towns of the plain between Jarmuth and Socoh, was in the neighbourhood of a large cave in which David took refuge when flying from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>). It was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>), and is mentioned in 2 Macc. 12:38 as the city of Odollam. The Onomast. describes it as being ten Roman miles to the east of Eleutheropolis; but this is a mistake, though it has not yet been discovered. So far as the situation is concerned, Deir Dubbn would suit very well, a place about two hours to the north of Beit Jibrin, near to a large number of caves in the white limestone, which form a kind of labyrinth, as well as some vaulted grottos (see Rob. Pal. ii. p. 353, and Van de Velde, Reise, pp. 162-3). Makkedah: possibly Summeil (see at <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>). Bethel, i.e., Beitin (see <a href="/joshua/8-17.htm">Joshua 8:17</a>). The situation of the towns which follow in <a href="/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a> cannot be determined with certainty, as the names Tappuach, Aphek, and Hefer are met with again in different parts of Canaan, and Lassaron does not occur again. But if we observe, that just as from <a href="/joshua/12-10.htm">Joshua 12:10</a> onwards those kings'-towns are first of all enumerated, the capture of which has already been described in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10.htm">Joshua 10</a>, and then in <a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-16.htm">Joshua 12:16</a> certain other towns are added which had been taken in the war with the Canaanites of the south, so likewise in <a href="/joshua/12-19.htm">Joshua 12:19</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-20.htm">Joshua 12:20</a> the capitals of the allied kings of northern Canaan are given first, and after that the other towns that were taken in the northern war, but had not been mentioned by name in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11.htm">Joshua 11</a>:there can be no doubt whatever that the four towns in <a href="/joshua/12-17.htm">Joshua 12:17</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a> are to be classed among the kings'-towns taken in the war with the king of Jerusalem and his allies, and therefore are to be sought for in the south of Canaan and not in the north. Consequently we cannot agree with Van de Velde and Knobel in identifying Tappuach with En-Tappuach (<a href="/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>), and looking for it in Atf, a place to the north-east of Nablus and near the valley of the Jordan; we connect it rather with Tappuach in the lowlands of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a>), though the place itself has not yet been discovered. Hefer again is neither to be identified with Gath-hepher in the tribe of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-13.htm">Joshua 19:13</a>), nor with Chafaraim in the tribe of Issachar (<a href="/joshua/19-19.htm">Joshua 19:19</a>), but is most probably the capital of the land of Hefer (<a href="/1_kings/4-10.htm">1 Kings 4:10</a>), and to be sought for in the neighbourhood of Socoh in the plain of Judah. Aphek is probably the town of that name not far from Ebenezer (<a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>), where the ark was taken by the Philistines, and is most likely to be sought for in the plain of Judah, though not in the village of Ahbek (Rob. Pal. ii. p. 343); but it has not yet been traced. Knobel imagines that it was Aphek near to Jezreel (<a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>), which was situated, according to the Onom., in the neighbourhood of Endor (<a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/20-25.htm">1 Kings 20:25</a>, <a href="/1_kings/20-30.htm">1 Kings 20:30</a>); but this Aphek is too far north. Lassaron only occurs here, and hitherto it has been impossible to trace it. Knobel supposes it to be the place called Saruneh, to the west of the lake of Tiberias, and conjectures that the name has been contracted from Lassaron by aphaeresis of the liquid. This is quite possible, if only we could look for Lassaron so far to the north. Bachienne and Rosenmller imagine it to be the village of Sharon in the celebrated plain of that name, between Lydda and Arsuf. </body></html>
