Moses gave to one part of Israel a very rich and fruitful country, but it was on the outside of Jordan. Joshua gave to all Israel the holy land, within Jordan. So the law has given to some few of God's spiritual Israel worldly blessings, earnests of good things to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true Joshua, provided for all the children of promise spiritual blessings, and the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the plain - Render "over the plain;" for the words describe not one of the boundaries of Sihon's kingdom, but part of the territory included in it, i. e. the eastern portion of the Ghor, between the Sea of Tiberias and the Dead Sea. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Jos 12:1-6.

So also below. <span class="cmt_word">The way to Beth-jeshimoth</span> (see <a href="/numbers/33-48.htm">Numbers 33:48, 49</a>). There was a desert tract near the Dead Sea called Jeshimon, or the waste district. It is described by travellers as the most arid portion of the whole land. In this, Beth-jeshimoth (the house of desolations) was situated. It was south of the acacia meadows (see note on Joshua 2:1), and it formed part of the territory of Reuben (<a href="/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20</a>). As it lay upon Jordan, it must have been near the extreme northernmost point of the Dead Sea. We are to understand, not that Sihon's territory extended to Beth-jeshimoth, but in that direction. Possibly some of the western Cauaanitish tribes here extended their territories across the Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">And from the south.</span> The word here is not Negeb, but Teman, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the literal south, which lay on the right (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) to one looking eastward. <span class="cmt_word">Ashdoth-pisgah.</span> For Ashdoth see <a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>. Pisgah was the northernmost point of the Abarim range, of which the well known Nebo was the chief peak. Thither Moses went up to view the land which he was not permitted to enter. There Balaam built his seven altars and essayed in vain to curse the children of Israel. There were the watchmen (Zophim) stationed to protect the land, in the days before the Israelitish invasion, from the incursions of the tribes on the other side of Jordan (<a href="/numbers/23-14.htm">Numbers 23:14</a>). The position of Pisgah has not been precisely identified, but the range extended on the eastern side of Jordan to a point nearly opposite Jericho. See <a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua made war with the kings of Canaan a long time; judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>, as much as seven years, though Josephus (Ant. v. 1, 19) speaks of five (see at <a href="/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>). No town submitted peaceably to the Israelites, with the exception of Gibeon: they took the whole in war. "For it was of the Lord" (<a href="/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a>), i.e., God ordered it so that they (the Canaanites) hardened their heart to make war upon Israel, that they might fall under the ban, and be destroyed without mercy. On the hardening of the heart as a work of God, see the remarks upon the hardening of Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). It cannot be inferred from this, that if the Canaanites had received the Israelites amicably, God would have withdrawn His command to destroy them, and allowed the Israelites to make peace with them; for when they made peace with the Gibeonites, they did not inquire what as the will of the Lord, but acted in opposition to it (see at <a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>). The remark is made with special reference to this, and has been correctly explained by Augustine (qu. 8 in Jos.) as follows: "Because the Israelites had shown mercy to some of them of their own accord, though in opposition to the command of God, therefore it is stated that they (the Canaanites) made war upon them so that none of them were spared, and the Israelites were not induced to show mercy to the neglect of the commandment of God." </body></html>
