It was also called Sion = “the elevated,” and is now known as <span class="ital">Jebel-es-Sheikh</span>, “the chief mountain,” which rises over 9000 feet. “In whatever part of Palestine the Israelite turned his eye northward, Hermon was there terminating the view.

First he traces out the border of the trans-Jordanic possessions of Israel, which he describes as bounded on the south by the river Arnon, on the west of course by the Jordan, and as extending from Hermon, past the Sea of Chinneroth, to the borders of the Dead Sea. The eastern border is not clearly defined, but the boundary extended far further eastward in the north than in the south, since the territory of Og was much more extensive than that of Sihon. On the west of Jordan the territory is described as extending "from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Baalbec or Caesarea Philippi; see note on ch. 11:17) unto the Mount Halak which goeth up to Seir, which we have seen to be a range of mountains extending southward from near the south point of the Dead Sea. The border of the Israelitish possessions is more accurately defined in the succeeding chapters, but it was, after all, a slip of territory not more than 180 miles in length by about 100 in breadth. Its influence upon the history of the world, like that of Athens and Sparta, must not be measured by its size, but by its moral energy. As the former city has attained undying fame by its intellectual power, the second by its mihtary capacity, so Palestine has derived her title to fame from her indestructible national life - indestructible because built alone, of all the religious systems of the ancient world, upon the foundations of the unity and Fatherhood of God; indestructible, moreover, because it came by revelation from God. There is no greater argument for the Divine origin of the Mosaic law than the unique spectacle of a national life like that of the Jews, subsisting for nearly two thousand years after their expulsion from their land. <span class="cmt_word">From the river Arnon</span> (see <a href="/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>). The word Arnon Signifies <span class="accented">the swift stream</span> (see Gesenius,'Thesaur.' s.v.). It is now called by the Arabs, <span class="accented">El-Mujeb</span>. Seetzen represents the region round its mouth to be naturally most fertile, but as abandoned now to a few wild plants. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Mount Hermon.</span> Now <span class="accented">Jebel-es-Sheikh</span>. We have a vivid description of the scenery of Hermon in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42</a>, with the noise of its foaming torrents, the "deep calling unto deep" from the recesses of its dark ravines, where the infant Jordan rushed along its rocky bed. The Psalmist pictures to himself his troubles as overwhelming him like the billows of the numerous streams that streaked the mountain sides. And yet again Hermon is introduced as the image of peace and plenty and brotherly love. The refreshing dews which distilled from the side of the giant mountain were the source of blessing to those who dwelt afar off, and even the dry and parched sides of Mount Zion were cooled by their delicious influence. In <a href="/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a> the Psalmist speaks of Hermon in the plural. Some have regarded this (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ritter) as referring to the double peak of the mountain. The phrase most probably refers to the region, though Hermon has really three peaks (see note on Joshua 11:3). <span class="cmt_word">And all the plain on the east.</span> The Arabah (see <a href="/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>). The depression of the Jordan, which lay eastward, of course, of Palestine. This is much insisted on in the following verses. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua made war with the kings of Canaan a long time; judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>, as much as seven years, though Josephus (Ant. v. 1, 19) speaks of five (see at <a href="/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>). No town submitted peaceably to the Israelites, with the exception of Gibeon: they took the whole in war. "For it was of the Lord" (<a href="/joshua/11-20.htm">Joshua 11:20</a>), i.e., God ordered it so that they (the Canaanites) hardened their heart to make war upon Israel, that they might fall under the ban, and be destroyed without mercy. On the hardening of the heart as a work of God, see the remarks upon the hardening of Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>). It cannot be inferred from this, that if the Canaanites had received the Israelites amicably, God would have withdrawn His command to destroy them, and allowed the Israelites to make peace with them; for when they made peace with the Gibeonites, they did not inquire what as the will of the Lord, but acted in opposition to it (see at <a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>). The remark is made with special reference to this, and has been correctly explained by Augustine (qu. 8 in Jos.) as follows: "Because the Israelites had shown mercy to some of them of their own accord, though in opposition to the command of God, therefore it is stated that they (the Canaanites) made war upon them so that none of them were spared, and the Israelites were not induced to show mercy to the neglect of the commandment of God." </body></html>
