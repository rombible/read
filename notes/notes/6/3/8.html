According to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/3-2.htm">Joshua 3:2</a>, they stayed there three days. "At the end (after the expiration) of three days" cannot refer to the three days mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>, if only because of the omission of the article, apart from the reasons given in the note upon <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>, which preclude the supposition that the two are identical. The reasons why the Israelites stayed three days by the side of the Jordan, after leaving Shittim, are not given, but they are not difficult to guess; for, in the first place, before it could be possible to pass into an enemy's country, not only with an army, but with all the people, including wives, children, and all their possessions, and especially when the river had first of all to be crossed, it must have been necessary to make many preparations, which would easily occupy two or three days. Besides this, the Jordan at that time was so high as to overflow its banks, so that it was impossible to cross the fords, and they were obliged to wait till this obstruction was removed. But as soon as Joshua was assured that the Lord would make a way for His people, he issued the following instructions through the proper officers to all the people in the camp: "When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and (see) the Levitical priests bear it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it: yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it; that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way yesterday and the day before." On the expression "the Levitical priests," see at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-25.htm">Deuteronomy 31:25</a>, as compared with <a href="/joshua/3-9.htm">Joshua 3:9</a> and <a href="/joshua/17-9.htm">Joshua 17:9</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-11.htm">Joshua 8:11</a>, should probably be pointed &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; (vid., Ewald, 266, a.). This command referred simply to the march from the last resting-place by the Jordan into the river itself, and not to the passage through the river, during which the priests remained standing with the ark in the bed of the river until the people had all passed through (<a href="/joshua/3-8.htm">Joshua 3:8</a> and <a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>). <p>(Note: Knobel maintains that this statement, according to which the Israelites were more than 2000 cubits from the place of crossing, is not in harmony with <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>, where they are said to have been by the Jordan already; but he can only show this supposed discrepancy in the text by so pressing the expression, they "came to Jordan," as to make it mean that the whole nation was encamped so close to the edge of the river, that at the very first step the people took their feet would touch the water.)<p>The people were to keep about 2000 cubits away from the ark. This was not done, however, to prevent their going wrong in the unknown way, and so missing the ford, for that was impossible under the circumstances; but the ark was carried in front of the people, not so much to show the road as to make a road by dividing the waters of the Jordan, and the people were to keep at a distance from it, that they might not lose sight of the ark, but keep their eyes fixed upon it, and know the road by looking at the ark of the covenant by which the road had been made, i.e., might know and observe how the Lord, through the medium of the ark, was leading them to Canaan by a way which they had never traversed before, i.e., by a miraculous way.</body></html>
