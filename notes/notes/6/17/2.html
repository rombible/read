"Father" here means lord or possessor of Gilead. This view is confirmed by the fact that it was not Machir, but his descendants, who subdued Gilead and Bashan (Nu 32:41; De 3:13-15). These Machirites had their portion on the east side of Jordan. The western portion of land, allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, was divided into ten portions because the male descendants who had sons consisted of five families, to which, consequently, five shares were given; and the sixth family, namely, the posterity of Hepher, being all women, the five daughters of Zelophehad were, on application to the valuators, endowed each with an inheritance in land (see on [197]Nu 27:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A lot, </span> or, a portion, or distinct inheritance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The rest of the children of Manasseh, </span> to wit, those of them which had not received their possessions beyond Jordan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/26-29.htm" title="Of the sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the Machirites: and Machir begat Gilead: of Gilead come the family of the Gileadites.">Numbers 26:29</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">These were the male children:</span> this expression is used to bring in what follows, concerning his female children. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families,....

"The border of their inheritance was from the east Atroth-addar and (along the line) to Upper Beth-horon," - a brief description of the southern boundary, which is more minutely described in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1-3</a>. Upper Beth-horon is mentioned here instead of Lower Beth-horon (<a href="/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>). This makes no difference, however, as the two places stood quite close to one another (see at <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6-8</a> the northern boundary of Ephraim is given, namely, from the middle, or from "a central point near the watershed" (Knobel), first towards the east (<a href="/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a> and <a href="/joshua/16-7.htm">Joshua 16:7</a>), and then towards the west (<a href="/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>). The eastern half of the northern boundary went &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., when regarded from the west, or looked at towards the west, to the north side of Michmethah. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>, this place was before Shechem, and therefore in any case it was not far from it, though it has not been discovered yet. Knobel supposes it to have been on the site of the present Kabate (Seetzen, ii. p. 166), Kubatiyeh, an hour and a half to the south of Jenin (Rob. iii. 154), assuming that Michmethah might also have been pronounced Chemathah, and that &#1489; may have been substituted for &#1502;. But Kabate is six hours to the north of Shechem, and therefore was certainly not "before Shechem" (<a href="/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>). It then turned "eastward to Taanath-shiloh" (&#x3a4;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#768;&#x3b8; &#x3a3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;, lxx), according to the Onom. (s. v. Thenath) ten Roman miles from Neapolis (Sichem), on the way to the Jordan, most probably the Thena of Ptol. (v. 16, 5), the present Tana, Ain Tana, a heap of ruins on the south-east of Nabulus, where there are large cisterns to be found (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 295; Ritter, Erdk. xv. p. 471). And "then went by on the east to Janoah" (i.e., Jano in Acrabittena regione, twelve Roman miles from Neapolis: Onom.), the present ruins of Jann, a miserable village, with extensive ruins of great antiquity, about three hours to the south-east of Nabulus, three-quarters of an hour to the north-east of Akrabeh (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 297; Van de Velde, R. ii. p. 268). </body></html>
