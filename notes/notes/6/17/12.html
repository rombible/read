Though each tribe had its inheritance, yet they should intermix one with another, to do good offices one to another, as became those, who, though of different tribes, were all one Israel, and were bound to love as brethren. But they suffered the Canaanites to live among them, against the command of God, to serve their own ends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Perhaps Beth-shean (in Issachar) and the other five towns (in Asher) were given to the Manassites in compensation for towns in the Manassite territory allotted to the Ephraimites. (See <a href="/joshua/17-9.htm">Joshua 17:9</a>. Compare <a href="/joshua/21-9.htm">Joshua 21:9</a>.) To the wall of Beth-shean, or Bethshah ("Beisan," about 5 miles west of the Jordan), the bodies of Saul and his sons were fastened by the Philistines after the battle on Mount Gilboa. After the exile it received the Greek name of Scythopolis, perhaps because it was principally tenanted by a rude and pagan population, styled in contempt Scythians. It was a border city of Galilee, and the chief town of the Decapolis. In Christian times it was the see of a bishop, who is enumerated as present at Nicaea and other Councils of the Church.<p>Ibleam (Bileam, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>), perhaps "Jelameh," was a Levitical town (<a href="/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a> note). Near this place Ahaziah was mortally wounded by Jehu (<a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>), and fled to Megiddo, which was no doubt not far distant.<p>Three countries - Rather "the three hills." The district belonging to the last-mentioned three towns had a common name, derived no doubt from its natural features, and was called "the three hills."

They therefore came before the committee appointed for dividing the land and repeated this promised, which as at once fulfilled. Consequently there were ten families of Manasseh who had received portions by the side of Ephraim, five male and five female. "And (<a href="/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5</a>) there fell the measurements of Manasseh (as) ten," i.e., ten portions were assigned to the Manassites (on the west of the Jordan), beside the land of Gilead, because (as is again observed in <a href="/joshua/17-6.htm">Joshua 17:6</a>) the daughters of Manasseh, i.e., of Zelophehad the Manassite, received an inheritance among his sons (i.e., the rest of the Manassites).</body></html>
