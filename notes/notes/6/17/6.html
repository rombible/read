The daughters of Zelophehad now reaped the benefit of their pious zeal and prudent forecast. Those who take care in the wilderness of this world, to make sure to themselves a place in the inheritance of the saints in light, will have the comfort of it in the other world; while those who neglect it now, will lose it for ever.

"Father" here means lord or possessor of Gilead. This view is confirmed by the fact that it was not Machir, but his descendants, who subdued Gilead and Bashan (Nu 32:41; De 3:13-15). These Machirites had their portion on the east side of Jordan. The western portion of land, allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, was divided into ten portions because the male descendants who had sons consisted of five families, to which, consequently, five shares were given; and the sixth family, namely, the posterity of Hepher, being all women, the five daughters of Zelophehad were, on application to the valuators, endowed each with an inheritance in land (see on [197]Nu 27:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Among his sons, </span> i.e. no less than the sons; so their sex was no bar to their inheritance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons,....

The ambiguity is due to the indefinite way in which "son" is used in Scripture. Thus the B'ne Israel, which we translate "children of Israel," is literally, "sons of Israel," or Jacob. So the sons of Manasseh, in like manner, are Manasseh's descendants. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Gezer, however (see <a href="/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>), they could not drive out the Canaanites, so that they still dwelt among the Ephraimites, but were reduced to a state of serfdom.
