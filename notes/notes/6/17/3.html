The daughters of Zelophehad now reaped the benefit of their pious zeal and prudent forecast. Those who take care in the wilderness of this world, to make sure to themselves a place in the inheritance of the saints in light, will have the comfort of it in the other world; while those who neglect it now, will lose it for ever.

"Father" here means lord or possessor of Gilead. This view is confirmed by the fact that it was not Machir, but his descendants, who subdued Gilead and Bashan (Nu 32:41; De 3:13-15). These Machirites had their portion on the east side of Jordan. The western portion of land, allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, was divided into ten portions because the male descendants who had sons consisted of five families, to which, consequently, five shares were given; and the sixth family, namely, the posterity of Hepher, being all women, the five daughters of Zelophehad were, on application to the valuators, endowed each with an inheritance in land (see on [197]Nu 27:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">No sons, but daughters; </span> of whom <span class="bld">see Poole "<a href="/numbers/26-33.htm" title="And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters: and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 26:33</a>"</span>; <span class="bld">see Poole "<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters,....

Naarath, probably the same as Naaran, in eastern Ephraim (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-28.htm">1 Chronicles 7:28</a>), is described in the Onom. (s. v. Naaratha) as viculus Judaeorum Naorath, five Roman miles (i.e., two hours) from Jericho, probably on the north-east. The boundary line then touched Jericho, i.e., the district of Jericho, namely on the north side of the district, as Jericho was allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>). At this point it also coincided with the southern boundary of the tribe of Joseph (<a href="/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>) and the northern boundary of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12</a>). </body></html>
