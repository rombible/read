There has been great discussion concerning this passage. The literal meaning is clearly that Manasseh was bordered by Asher on the north, and Issachar on the east. The idea of an Asher-ham-Michmethah must be given up if we take this rendering of the Hebrew. Its only justification is the fact that if Michmethah be at once the northern border of Ephraim and Manasseh, the territory of Manasseh is cut almost in half. And, in fact, such a supposition makes confusion worse confounded. Is it probable that in vers. 7 and 10 Asher-ham-Michmethah is meant; that the town Asher is mentioned in similar terms to the tribe Issachar in the latter verse; and that in ver. 11, without a single intimation of the change of meaning, the tribes Issachar and Asher are mentioned? Again: if Dor - considerably to the south of Mount Carmel - was within the territory of Asher (ver. 11), how can we possibly, as Conder's 'Handbook' does, place the limits of Asher at Accho, and bring Zebulun to the sea  (which it never reaches, for "toward the sea," in <a href="/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11</a> clearly means "westward"), interposing a large strip of territory between Manasseh and Asher, placing Dor, in spite of ver. 11, far within the limits of Manasseh, and giving this last tribe, or rather half tribe, an extraordinarily disproportioned share of the land? (See the complaint in ver. 16). Zebulun, too, was on the eastern border of Asher (<a href="/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), and it is by no means certain that Shihor Libnath (see <a href="/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>) is not the Wady Zerka, south of Dor. This is the view of Knobel, a commentator by no means void of acuteness. This contraction of Manasseh's territory explains why cities had to be given to it out of Asher and Issachar, as well as the complaint in the latter part of this chapter. Issachar, <span class="accented">too</span>, must have stretched considerably southward. But the vagueness of the description of Manasseh's border, especially on the north, prevents us from assigning any limits to Issachar in this direction; while it is impossible, with a writer in the Quarterly Papers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, to suppose that it extended from Jezreel and Shunem and Endor on the north as far as Jericho to the south. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Among the six families of Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/17-2.htm">Joshua 17:2</a>), Zelophehad, a descendant of Hepher, left no son; but he had five daughters, whose names are given in <a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a> (as in <a href="/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/36-10.htm">Numbers 36:10</a>).

They therefore came before the committee appointed for dividing the land and repeated this promised, which as at once fulfilled. Consequently there were ten families of Manasseh who had received portions by the side of Ephraim, five male and five female. "And (<a href="/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5</a>) there fell the measurements of Manasseh (as) ten," i.e., ten portions were assigned to the Manassites (on the west of the Jordan), beside the land of Gilead, because (as is again observed in <a href="/joshua/17-6.htm">Joshua 17:6</a>) the daughters of Manasseh, i.e., of Zelophehad the Manassite, received an inheritance among his sons (i.e., the rest of the Manassites).</body></html>
