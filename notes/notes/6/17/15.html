Joshua tells them, that what was fallen to their share would be a sufficient lot for them, if they would but work and fight. Men excuse themselves from labour by any pretence; and nothing serves the purpose better than having rich and powerful relations, able to provide for them; and they are apt to desire a partial and unfaithful disposal of what is intrusted to those they think able to give such help. But there is more real kindness in pointing out the advantages within reach, and in encouraging men to make the best of them, than in granting indulgences to sloth and extravagance. True religion gives no countenance to these evils. The rule is, They shall not eat who will not work; and many of our cannots are only the language of idleness, which magnifies every difficulty and danger. This is especially the case in our spiritual work and warfare. Without Christ we can do nothing, but we are apt to sit still and attempt nothing. if we belong to Him, he will stir us up to our best endeavours, and to cry to him for help. Then our coast will be enlarged, 1Ch 4:9,10, and complainings silenced, or rather, turned into joyful thanksgivings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joshua was himself of the tribe of Ephraim, but far from supporting the demands of his kinsmen he reproves them, and calls upon them to make good their great words by corresponding deeds of valor. He bids them clear the country of its woods and thus make room for settling their people. The "wood country" means probably the range which runs along the northern border of Manasseh, and which connects the mountains of Gilboa with Carmel. Mount Ephraim, (a name perhaps used by anticipation) called "the hill" <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>, and "the mountain of Israel" <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a>, is the eastern portion of the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh extending toward the Jordan.

It is an elevated district of limestone, consisting of rounded hills separated by valleys of denudation, but much less regular and monotonous than that part more to the south, about and below Jerusalem; with wide plains in the heart of the mountains, streams of running water, and continuous tracts of vegetation. That the “mount” was then covered with woods is clear from <a href="/1_samuel/14-25.htm" title="And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground.">1 Samuel 14:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-6.htm" title="So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;">2 Samuel 18:6</a>, and even now travellers have found wooded heights, and forests of oak trees, between Carmel and the mountains of Samaria. To these mountain heights even the members of other tribes resorted for shelter and for power. “Ehud the Benjamite, when he armed his countrymen against Moab, ‘blew his trumpet <span class="ital">in the mountain of Ephraim</span>’ (<a href="/context/judges/3-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them....">Jdg 3:27-28</a>); Deborah, though, as it would seem, herself of the northern tribes, ‘dwelt between Ramah and Bethel in <span class="ital">Mount Ephraim</span>’ (<a href="/judges/4-5.htm" title="And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.">Jdg 4:5</a>).

Whether this be the "wood of Ephraim" mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6</a> has been much disputed. For not only David is related to have crossed the Jordan, but Absalom also, in hot pursuit of his father (see <a href="/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>). Neither army is mentioned as having recrossed the river; and it is a question whether it is more probable that there happened to be a "wood of Ephraim" on the other side of Jordan, or that Joab and Absalom, with their respective armies, recrossed Jordan without a word being said of the fact by the historian; the more especially as David (see <a href="/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15-17, 31</a>) remained on the other side Jordan, while yet it was possible for the Ethiopian attendant, as well as Jonathan, to run to him with tidings of the defeat and death of Absalom. For the wood country in this neighbourhood cf. <a href="/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>. Ewald would regard the language here as figurative, and the wood as referring to the powerful Phoenician tribes in the neighbourhood. He regards this answer as a sign of Joshua's "wit." But the interpretation seems far fetched and improbable. <span class="cmt_word">Cut down.</span> Or, <span class="accented">make a clearing</span>, just as emigrants do now in the primeval forest.

It went "from Asher to Michmethah, before Shechem." Asher is not the territory of the tribe of Asher, but a distinct locality; according to the Onom. (s. v. Asher) a place on the high road from Neapolis to Scythopolis, fifteen Roman miles from the former. It is not to be found, however, in the ruins of Tell Um el Aschera (V. de Velde) or Tell Um Ajra (Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 310, 327), an hour to the south of Beisan, as Knobel supposes, but in the village of Yasir, where there are magnificent ruins, about five hours and ten minutes from Nabulus on the road to Beisan (V. de Velde, Mem. pp. 237, 289; R. ii. p. 295). Michmethah, before Shechem, is still unknown (see <a href="/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>). Shechem was founded by the Hivite prince Shechem (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>), and is frequently mentioned in the book of Genesis. It stood between Ebal and Gerizim, was given up by Ephraim to the Levites, and declared a free city (city of refuge: <a href="/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). It was there that the ten tribes effected their separation from Judah <a href="/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1</a>.), and Jeroboam resided there (<a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). In later times it was the chief city of the country of Samaria, and the capital of the Samaritans (<a href="/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>); and the name of Neapolis, or Flavia Neapolis, from which the present Nabulus or Nablus has come, was given to it in honour of Vespasian (see v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 161ff.). From this point the boundary went &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; (i.e., either "to the right side," the south side, or to Yamin), "To the inhabitants of En-tappuah." Whether Yamin is an appellative or a proper name is doubtful. But even if it be the name of a place, it is quite certain that it cannot be the village of Yamn, an hour to the south-east of Taanuk (Rob. iii. pp. 161, 167, etc.), as this is much too far north, and, judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>, belonged to the territory of Asher. In the case of En-tappuah, the inhabitants are mentioned instead of the district, because the district belonged to Manasseh, whilst the town on the border of Manasseh was given to the Ephraimites. The situation of the town has not yet been discovered: see at <a href="/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>. From this point the boundary ran down to the Cane-brook (see <a href="/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>), namely to the south side of the brook.<p>"These towns were assigned to Ephraim in the midst of the towns of Manasseh, and (but) the territory of Manasseh was on the north of the brook." The only possible meaning of these words is the following: From Tappuah, the boundary went down to the Cane-brook and crossed it, so that the south side of the brook really belonged to the territory of Manasseh; nevertheless the towns on this south side were allotted to Ephraim, whilst only the territory to the north of the brook fell to the lot of the Manassites. This is expressed more plainly in <a href="/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>: "To the south (of the brook the land came) to Ephraim, and to the north to Manasseh." In <a href="/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a> the northern and eastern boundaries are only briefly indicated: "And they (the Manassites) touched Asher towards the north, and Issachar towards the east." The reason why this boundary was not described more minutely, was probably because it had not yet been fixed. For (<a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>) Manasseh also received towns and districts in (within the territory of) Issachar and Asher, viz., Beth-shean, etc. Beth-shean, to the wall of which Saul's body was fastened (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>.; <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12</a>), was afterwards called Scythopolis. It was in the valley of the Jordan, where the plain of Jezreel slopes off into the valley; its present name is Beisan, a place where there are considerable ruins of great antiquity, about two hours from the Jordan (vid., Seetzen, ii. pp. 162ff.; Rob. iii. p. 174; Bibl. Res. p. 325; v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 150-1). This city, with its daughter towns, was in the territory of Issachar, which was on the east of Manasseh, and may have extended a considerable distance towards the south along the valley of the Jordan, as the territory of Manasseh and Ephraim did not run into the valley of the Jordan; but Asher (Yasir) is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a> as the most easterly place in Manasseh, and, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6-7</a>, the eastern boundary of Ephraim ran down along the eastern edge of the mountains as far as Jericho, without including the Jordan valley. At the same time, the Ghor on the western side of the Jordan below Beisan, as far as the plain of Jericho, was of no great value to any tribe, as this district, according to Josephus (de Bell. Jud. iv. 8, 2, and iii. 10, 7), was uninhabited because of its barrenness. The other towns, Ibleam, etc., with the exception of Endor perhaps, were in the territory of Asher, and almost all on the south-west border of the plain of Esdraelon. Ibleam, called Bileam in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-55.htm">1 Chronicles 6:55</a> (70), a Levitical town (see at <a href="/joshua/21-25.htm">Joshua 21:25</a>), was not very far from Megiddo (<a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>), and has probably been preserved in the ruins of Khirbet-Belameh, half an hour to the south of Jenin; according to Schultz, it is the same place as Belamon, Belmen, or Belthem (Judith 4:4; 7:3; 8:3). With &#1491;&#1488;&#1512; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; the construction changes, so that there is an anacolouthon, which can be explained, however, on the ground that &#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; may not only mean to be assigned to, but also to receive or to have. In this last sense &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; is attached. The inhabitants are mentioned instead of the towns, because the historian had already the thought present in his mind, that the Manassites were unable to exterminate the Canaanites from the towns allotted to them. Dor is the present Tortura (see at <a href="/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). Endor, the home of the witch (<a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>), four Roman miles to the south of Tabor (Onom.), at present a village called Endr, on the northern shoulder of the Duhy or Little Hermon (see Rob. iii. p. 225; Bibl. Res. p. 340). Taanach and Megiddo, the present Taanuk and Lejun (see at <a href="/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>). The three last towns, with the places dependent upon them, are connected more closely together by &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1508;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, the three-hill-country, probably because they formed a common league.</body></html>
