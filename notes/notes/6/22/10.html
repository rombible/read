And thus it is here to be interpreted, that before they went any farther, while they were yet on the bank of Jordan, they erected this altar on the borders of their own country; for so the next verse teaches us to expound the passage, and will admit of no other sense, where it is said they had built this altar, not <span class="ital">in, </span>but <span class="ital">over against the land of Canaan. </span>Indeed it is not likely that they would have ventured to erect it in the territory of the other tribes. Nor would it have answered their intention to have built it there, which was to show, by this monument, that Jordan made no such separation between them and their brethren, but that they were one people with those in Canaan, where the altar of God was in Shiloh. See <a href="/joshua/22-28.htm" title="Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.">Joshua 22:28</a>.

At first sight it seemed a design to set up an altar against the altar at Shiloh. God is jealous for his own institutions; we should be so too, and afraid of every thing that looks like, or leads to idolatry. Corruptions in religion are best dealt with at first. But their prudence in following up this zealous resolution is no less commendable. Many an unhappy strife would be prevented, or soon made up, by inquiries into the matter of the offence. The remembrance of great sins committed formerly, should engage us to stand on our guard against the beginnings of sin; for the way of sin is down-hill. We are all concerned to reprove our neighbour when he does amiss, lest we suffer sin upon him, Le 19:17.

They Build the Altar of Testimony on Their Journey.<p>10. when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben &#8230; built there an altar by Jordan&#8212;This altar was probably an immense pile of stones and earth. The generality of our translators supposes that it was reared on the banks of the Jordan, within the limits of Canaan proper. But a little closer examination seems to make the conclusion irresistible that its position was on the eastern side of the river, for these two reasons; first, because it is said (Jos 22:11) to have been built "over against," or in the sight of the land of Canaan&#8212;not within it; and secondly, because the declared motive of the trans-jordanic Israelites in erecting it was to prevent their brethren in Canaan ever saying, "in time to come, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel? For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you," &c. [Jos 22:24, 25]. Such a taunt would be obviously prevented or confuted by the two tribes and a half having on the eastern side of Jordan, within their own land, a facsimile of the altar at Shiloh, as a witness that they acknowledged the same God and practised the same rites of worship as the brethren in Canaan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">built then</span>, as this particle is elsewhere used; and so learned interpreters understand it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5</a> 36:12 <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm" title="I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a> <a href="/hosea/2-15.htm" title="And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.">Hosea 2:15</a></span>. And in the Latin tongue adverbs of place are sometimes put for adverbs of time: so I take it here. First, Because this best answers to the when in the beginning of the verse. Secondly, This seems to me to clear a great difficulty as to the place where the altar-was built, which though according to our translation it seems, and is generally thought by interpreters to have been, in the land of Canaan; yet if things be more narrowly examined, it may be thought to have been on the other side Jordan in Gilead; and that both, first, from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/21-11.htm" title="And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.">Joshua 21:11</a></span>, where it is said to have been built <span class="ital">over against</span>, or <span class="ital">in the sight of the land of Canaan</span>, therefore not in it. And secondly, from the reason they gave of the building of this altar, <span class="ital">for fear</span> lest the Israelites within Jordan and in Canaan <span class="ital">should say unto their children</span> dwelling beyond Jordan, <span class="ital">The Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you</span>, &c.; which jealousy would have been much confirmed by building the altar in Canaan, but would be satisfied and confuted by having on the other side of Jordan, and in their own land, a pattern of that altar at which God was served in the land of Canaan, as a witness that they owned the same God, and the same way of worship, with their brethren that lived in Canaan. But whether the Hebrew particle be rendered <span class="ital">then</span> or <span class="ital">there</span>, it is not to be taken too strictly: if <span class="ital">then</span>, the meaning is not, that they did this as soon as ever <span class="ital">they came to the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan</span>; but about that time when they came to them, that they thought and designed it, and as soon as ever they were got over Jordan, which was in a very little time, they effected and perfected it: if it be rendered <span class="ital">there</span>, it is not to be limited to the very same spot of ground mentioned before, as if it was built at <span class="ital">that border of Jordan that was in the land of Canaan</span>; but to be a little more largely understood; to be built at one or other of the borders of Jordan; or, in general, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">by Jordan; </span> which is here purposely added, for the explication of the word there, and to prevent the restraint of it to the border of Jordan, within Canaan. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan,....

The site of this interesting memorial has been lately discovered by the officers of the Survey of Palestine. It is an almost inaccessible mountain, except from the north, where the ascent is called <span class="ital">Tal’at abn’Ayd</span> = “the going up to Ed.” It projects like a white bastion towards the river, some twenty miles north of Jericho, and close to the line of march from Shiloh to Gilead, and on its summit are the remains of a huge monument of masonry, bearing traces of fire on its upper surface.

The place has now been found by Lieut. Conder, its name still existing, on the high peak known as Kurn Surtabeh, in the valley of the Jordan. Independently of the special interest attaching to the spot, this recovery illustrates remarkably the vitality of the old Biblical names.

Bishop Horsley, however, would render a great altar <span class="accented">in appearance</span>, supposing that what is meant is that it only looked like an altar, and was not intended to be used as one. One of the most valuable results of the Palestine exploration movement has been the discovery of the site of this altar, which seems probable, in spite of Lieutenant Conder's abandonment of the theory in his 'Tent Work in Palestine,' 2:53. The reasons for the identification are as follows. The altar must be near one of the fords of Jordan. It must be on this side of Jordan (see note on vers. 24, 25). It must be in a conspicuous position, as we have just seen. Now Kurn Sartabeh or Surtubeh (see note on Joshua 3:16), visible from a great distance on all sides, from Ebal, from near Gennesaret, thirty miles off, from the Dead Sea, from the eastern high lands, and from the Judaean watershed (see Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund, Oct. 1874), fulfils all these conditions. Dr. Hutchinson replies (Quarterly Paper, Jan. 1876) that the altar is stated by Josephus to have been on the east side of Jordan, and that it was improbable that the two and a half tribes would have erected the altar on the cis-Jordanic territory, or so near to Shiloh, because Ephraim would have resented this. Moreover, the words, "a great altar <span class="accented">to be seen,"</span> would imply that it was to be visible from a long distance, so that the two tribes and a half might see it from their side of Jordan. It must be confessed that the evidence for the identification is but slight, but so also are the arguments against it. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Josephus is not infallible, and the Hebrew text seems to assert the very opposite of what he says. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the other tribes <span class="accented">did</span> resent the erection of the altar. Lieutenant Conder now admits that it is possible that the words stating that the tribes crossed "by the passage of the children of Israel "(ver. 11, but see note there) leads to the idea that the ford by Jericho is meant, and not the Damieh ford by Kurn Sartabeh. See, however, the translation given below. The fact that the Arabs call the place the ascent of the father of Ayd, which has a close resemblance to the Hebrew word <span class="accented">Ed</span>, "witness," does not appear conclusive, though it lends some degree of probability to the theory. On the other hand, it might be contended that if the Reubenites and Gadites had not erected the altar on their own territory, it would not have excited the wrath of the remaining tribes. But as the best authorities are content to leave the matter uncertain, it must be left uncertain here. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/joshua/22-4.htm">Joshua 22:4</a> points back to <a href="/joshua/1-15.htm">Joshua 1:15</a>.
