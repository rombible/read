Proud and peevish spirits, when they have passed any unjust blame on their brethren, though full evidence be brought of its unfairness, can by no means be persuaded to withdraw it. But Israel was not so prejudiced. They looked upon their brethren's innocence as a token of God's presence. Our brethren's zeal for the power of godliness, and faith and love, notwithstanding the fears of their breaking the unity of the church, are things of which we should be very glad to be satisfied. The altar was called ED, a witness. It was a witness of their care to keep their religion pure and entire, and would witness against their descendants, if they should turn from following after the Lord. Happy will it be when all professed Christians learn to copy the example of Israel, to unite zeal and steady adherence to the cause of truth, with candour, meekness, and readiness to understand each other, to explain and to be satisfied with the explanations of their brethren. May the Lord increase the number of those who endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace! may increasing grace and consolation be with all who love Jesus Christ in sincerity!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The repeated invocation of God, and that by His three names - &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l, &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#774;loh&#305;&#770;ym, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h: compare <a href="/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a> - marks the earnestness of the protestation.

Had they been actuated by jealousy or party spirit, they would have admitted no defence, or have endeavoured out of the clearest exculpation to find some new topic for complaint. So religious party spirit has been wont to inflame men's minds in later times, so that they desired rather victory over a supposed antagonist than the discovery that no offence at all bad been committed. True religious zeal is slow to anger, and easy to be appeased, when it appears that no harm has been intended. It might have been contended in this case, if controversy rather than truth had been the object, that the action had a dangerous tendency; that though the altar was not intended for sacrifice, it might be used for that purpose; that it was unwise to put a temptation in the way of future ages to substitute worship there for worship in the tabernacle. Such arguments are not unknown even to Christian zealots. Israel was satisfied that no harm was intended. It was not thought necessary to point out possibilities which were not likely to be realised. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In utter amazement at the suspicion expressed by the delegates of the congregation, the two tribes and a half affirm with a solemn oath, that it never entered into their minds to build an altar as a place of sacrifice, to fall away from Jehovah. The combination of the three names of God-El, the strong one; Elohim, the Supreme Being to be feared; and Jehovah, the truly existing One, the covenant God (<a href="/joshua/22-22.htm">Joshua 22:22</a>), - serves to strengthen the invocation of God, as in <a href="/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a>; and this is strengthened still further by the repetition of these three names. God knows, and let Israel also know, sc., what they intended, and what they have done. The &#1488;&#1501; which follows is the usual particle used in an oath. "Verily (it was) not in rebellion, nor in apostasy from Jehovah," sc., that this was done, or that we built the altar. "Mayst Thou not help us to-day," sc., if we did it in rebellion against God. An appeal addressed immediately to God in the heat of the statement, and introduced in the midst of the asseveration, which was meant to remove all doubt as to the truth of their declaration. The words which follow in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/22-23.htm">Joshua 22:23</a>, "that we have built," etc., continue the oath: "If we have done this, to build us an altar, to turn away from the Lord, or to offer thereon burnt-offering, meat-offering, or peace-offering, may Jehovah himself require it (&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19</a>; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-16.htm">1 Samuel 20:16</a>). Another earnest parenthetical adjuration, as the substance of the oath, is continued in <a href="/joshua/22-24.htm">Joshua 22:24</a>. "But truly (&#1500;&#1488; &#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, with an affirmative signification) from anxiety, for a reason (lit. on account of a thing) have we done this, thinking (&#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, since we thought) in time to come your sons might say to our sons, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?" i.e., He does not concern you; He is our God. "Jehovah has made the Jordan a boundary between us and your sons; ye have no part in Jehovah. Thus your sons might make our sons cease to fear Jehovah," i.e., might make them desist from the worship of Jehovah (for the infinitive form &#1497;&#1512;&#1488; instead of the abbreviated form &#1500;&#1512;&#1488; used in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-29.htm">1 Samuel 18:29</a>, there are analogies in &#1497;&#1510;&#1511; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3</a>, and &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>, whereas &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is the only form used in the Pentateuch). There was some reason for this anxiety. For, inasmuch as in all the promises and laws Canaan alone (the land on this side of the Jordan, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1-12</a>) is always mentioned as the land which Jehovah would give to His people for their inheritance, it was quite a possible thing that at some future time the false conclusion might be drawn from this, that only the tribes who dwelt in Canaan proper were the true people of Jehovah. </body></html>
