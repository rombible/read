At first sight it seemed a design to set up an altar against the altar at Shiloh. God is jealous for his own institutions; we should be so too, and afraid of every thing that looks like, or leads to idolatry. Corruptions in religion are best dealt with at first. But their prudence in following up this zealous resolution is no less commendable. Many an unhappy strife would be prevented, or soon made up, by inquiries into the matter of the offence. The remembrance of great sins committed formerly, should engage us to stand on our guard against the beginnings of sin; for the way of sin is down-hill. We are all concerned to reprove our neighbour when he does amiss, lest we suffer sin upon him, Le 19:17. The offer made that they should be welcome to come to the land where the Lord's tabernacle was, and settle there, was in the spirit of true Israelites.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unclean - i. e. unholy because the sanctuary was not in it, but on the other side of Jordan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 22:11-29.

The act being suspected of some idolatrous design, the tribes rose in a mass, and repairing to the tabernacle at Shiloh, resolved to declare war against the two tribes and a half as apostates from God. On calmer and more mature consideration, however, they determined, in the first instance, to send a deputation consisting of the son of the high priest, and ten eminent persons from each tribe, to make inquiry into this rumored rebellion against God (De 13:13-15). The quality of the deputies evinced the deep solicitude that was felt on the occasion to maintain the purity of the divine worship throughout Israel. In the presumptive belief that the two tribes and a half had really built an altar, the deputies expressed astonishment at their so soon falling into such a heinous crime as that of violating the unity of divine worship (Ex 20:24; Leviticus 17:8, 9; De 12:5-13). They reminded their eastern brethren of the disastrous consequences that were entailed on the nation at large by the apostasy at Peor and by the sin of Achan, and finally exhorted them, if they felt the want of the tabernacle and altar and repented of their rash choice in preferring worldly advantages to religious privileges, to remove to the western side of the Jordan, where all the tribes would form a united and obedient community of worshippers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The son of Zerah, </span> i.e. one of his posterity, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/7-17.htm" title="And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:">Joshua 7:17</a>,18</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Perished not alone, </span> but brought destruction upon his whole family, and part of our forces sent against Ai. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In his iniquity, </span> or, <span class="ital">for his sin</span>; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Did not Achan the son of Zerah,....

The case of Achan is even more in point than that of Peer. In his case the Israelites had a clear proof that "one man's sin," unless completely and absolutely put away, brought God's dis. pleasure on "all the congregation" (<a href="/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>). The repulse at Ai, fresh as it must have been in the memory of all, was sufficient evidence of this.
