Passing along the valley of Achor (<span class= "ital">Wâdy Kelt</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>it left Gilgal on the north, and ascended the pass to the going up of Adummim (<span class= "ital">Tal’at-ed-Dumm</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the ancient and modern name ‘bloody’ being apparently derived from the brick-red marls here found amid a district of white chalk.” (It is easy to conjecture other reasons.) A line of Roman road on the map is a very fair guide to the boundary here described, and thus far it lies on sheet 18 En Rogel, the next known point (on sheet 17), close to Zoheleth (Zahweileh, <a href="/1_kings/1-9.htm" title="And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:">1Kings 1:9</a>), was evidently the present spring <span class= "ital">‘Ain Umm-ed-Deraj, </span>in the Kedron Valley (this may be sought in the separate survey of Jerusalem, which is upon a larger scale). Thence the border ran across the slope (Cataph, <a href="/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>, “side”), beside the valley of Ben Hinnom (<span class= "ital">Wâdy Rabâby</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>south of Jebus, and thus reached the watershed. (Here the boundary-line takes a turn to the northward.) It then apparently passed along the broad vale (Emek, <a href="/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>) of Rephaim (“valley of the giants”), which Josephus makes to extend towards Bethlehem.
