Baalah was probably the earlier or Canaanite appellation. We have already met with Kirjath-jearim as one of the four cities of the Gibeonites (above, ch. <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day.

Far more probable is the notion of Vandevelde, which places it northwest of Jerusalem, at Ain Lifta. Conder's view is dominated by the situation he has assigned to Kirjath-jearim (see note on Joshua 9:17). If the view there given in these notes is sound, the border now ran in a northwesterly direction from Jerusalem to within five miles of Gibeon (see also note on Joshua 18:14). <span class="cmt_word">Kirjath-jearim.</span> See <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>. To the authorities mentioned there in favour of Kuriet el Enab we may add Knobel, Ritter, and Tristram, in his last book, 'Bible Lands.' The view taken above corresponds to the minuteness of detail with which the boundary is given. To place Nephtoah south of Bethlehem and Kirjath-jearim at 'Arma would make the boundary far less distinct. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thence it proceeded "to the southern boundary of the ascent of Akrabbim," i.e., the row of lofty whitish cliffs which intersects the Arabah about eight miles below the Dead Sea (see at <a href="/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>), "and passed across to Zin," i.e., the Wady Murreh (see at <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>), "and went up to the south of Kadesh-barnea," i.e., by Ain Kudes (see at <a href="/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>), "and passed over to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and turned to Karkaa, and went over to Azmon, and went out into the brook of Egypt," i.e., the Wady el Arish. On the probable situation of Hezron, Adar, Karkaa, and Azmon, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4-5</a>. "And the outgoings of the boundary were to the sea" (the Mediterranean). The Wady el Arish, a marked boundary, takes first of all a northerly and then a north-westerly course, and opens into the Mediterranean Sea (see Pent. p. 358). &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in the singular before the subject in the plural must not be interfered with (see Ewald, 316, a.). - The words "this shall be your south coast" point back to the southern boundary of Canaan as laid down in <a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>., and show that the southern boundary of the tribe-territory of Judah was also the southern boundary of the land to be taken by Israel.</body></html>
