The name ( "shaggy mountain") is applicable to any rugged or well-wooded hill. Here it probably denotes the range which runs southwestward from Kirjath-jearim to the Wady Surar. Mount Jearim, i. e. "woody mountain," is through its other name, Chesalon, identified with the modern "Kesla".<p>Beth-shemesh - i. e.

Beth-shemesh was the first place at which the ark rested after its return from the hands of the Philistines <a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>.

Or, deflected (see ver. 4). This is in accordance with the view taken above. The border line which had run northwest from Jerusalem now bent backwards in a southwesterly direction, and followed the ridge towards Chesalon (see note on Chesalon). Mount Seir. Not the dwelling place of Esau, afterwards the country of the Edomites (<a href="/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>), but a range running southwestward from Kirjath-jearim, part of which is still known as Sairah, or Saris, "auf welchem <span class="accented">Saris</span> und <span class="accented">Mihsir</span> liegen" (Kuobel). Since Kirjath-jearim means the "city of the forests," and Seir means "hairy," we may conjecture that the name was given to the ridge on account of its wooded character. This also is implied by "Mount Jearim." <span class="cmt_word">The side of Mount Jearim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">the shoulder</span> (see above, ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Which is Chesalon.</span> This is identified with <span class="accented">Kesia</span>, a point on the summit of the ridge stretching southwest from Kirjath-jearim. The fact that the border passed northward of Chesalon is a confirmation of the view taken above. We learn from <a href="/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a> (cf. ver. 33 of this chapter), that the border passed by Zorah and Eshtaol in the Shephelah, through a neighbourhood described in Conder's Handbook as "an open corn country." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shemesh.</span> The "house of the sun," identified with the modern Ain (or fountain of) Shems. It is called Irshemesh in <a href="/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>. It was close to the border of the Philistines, and was the scene of the transactions recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a>. The propinquity to the Philistines appears to have affected the principles of its inhabitants, and their conduct contrasts most unfavourably with that of the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim. This was the more disgraceful, in that Beth-shemesh (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>) was a priestly city, and being inhabited by those whose "lips should keep knowledge," might have been expected to set a better example. It was required to furnish Solomon's household with provisions (<a href="/1_kings/4-9.htm">1 Kings 4:9</a>), it witnessed the defeat and capture of Amaziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11-13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>) by Joash, king of Israel. It fell into the hands of the Philistines at the time of the decay of the Jewish power under Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). The name, like Baal-Gad and Ashtaroth-Karnaim, is worthy of remark, as pointing to the character of the early Phoenician worship. <span class="cmt_word">Timnah.</span> Sometimes called Timnath in Scripture (see <a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1-6</a>), and Timnatha in <a href="/joshua/19-43.htm">Joshua 19:43</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thence it proceeded "to the southern boundary of the ascent of Akrabbim," i.e., the row of lofty whitish cliffs which intersects the Arabah about eight miles below the Dead Sea (see at <a href="/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>), "and passed across to Zin," i.e., the Wady Murreh (see at <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>), "and went up to the south of Kadesh-barnea," i.e., by Ain Kudes (see at <a href="/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>), "and passed over to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and turned to Karkaa, and went over to Azmon, and went out into the brook of Egypt," i.e., the Wady el Arish. On the probable situation of Hezron, Adar, Karkaa, and Azmon, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4-5</a>. "And the outgoings of the boundary were to the sea" (the Mediterranean). The Wady el Arish, a marked boundary, takes first of all a northerly and then a north-westerly course, and opens into the Mediterranean Sea (see Pent. p. 358). &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in the singular before the subject in the plural must not be interfered with (see Ewald, 316, a.). - The words "this shall be your south coast" point back to the southern boundary of Canaan as laid down in <a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>., and show that the southern boundary of the tribe-territory of Judah was also the southern boundary of the land to be taken by Israel.</body></html>
