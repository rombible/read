The second rendering is quite admissible (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm">2 Samuel 13:32</a>, with <a href="/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>), but the former is the more usual; and for this the Masorites have decided, since they have separated achi Caleb from ben-Kenaz by a tiphchah. And this is the correct one, as "the son of Kenaz" is equivalent to "the Kenizzite" (<a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>). According to <a href="/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>, Othniel was Caleb's younger brother. Caleb gave him his daughter for a wife, as marriage with a brother's daughter was not forbidden in the law (see my Bibl. Archol. ii. 107, note 14).</body></html>
