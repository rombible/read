The mountains, which are of limestone, rise to a height of near 3,000 feet. At present, the highlands of Judah present a somewhat dreary and monotonous aspect. The peaks are for the most part barren, though crowned almost everywhere with the ruins of ancient towns, and bearing on their sides marks of former cultivation. Many of the valleys, especially toward the south, are, however, still very productive.

It extends northwards from near Debir to Jerusalem, attaining at Hebron a height of about 2,700 feet. The physical characteristics of the country are vividly described in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7, 8</a>. Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 100) descants on the home-like character of the scenery and vegetation to an Englishman, and remarks on the contrast between the life, activity, and industry displayed there, as contrasted with the desolation of the greater part of Palestine. A later traveller, who would not, of course, be so struck with the resemblance to English scenery, speaks of the fertility of the ground as a matter of possibility, rather than of fact. The rocky soil, when broken up by the combined influences of heat, rain, and frost, is, like the soil of other rocky districts, extremely susceptible of cultivation when laid out in terraces. He remarks how the signs of ancient cultivation in this manner are to be seen on all sides, and laments the misrule which has converted the "land flowing with milk and honey" into a wilderness (see Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' ch. 19, and note on Joshua 10:40). The time has not yet come for the Jews, now asserting their ancient greatness in statesmanship, literature, and art in every country in the civilised world, to return to their own land. Not till then, it is to be feared, will the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35</a>. be fulfilled, and "the desert rejoice, and the wilderness blossom as the rose, while waters break out in the wilderness and streams in the desert, the parched ground becoming a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The third group, consisting of the towns in the southern half of the hilly region: nine towns.<p><a href="/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a><p>Libnah: see at <a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>. Ether and Ashan, which were afterwards given to the Simeonites (<a href="/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a>), and are probably to be sought for on the border of the Negeb, have not yet been discovered. The conjecture that Ether is connected with the ruins of Attrah (Rob. iii. App.) in the province of Gaza, is a very uncertain one. Ashan, probably the same as Kor-ashan (<a href="/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a>), became a priests' city afterwards (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>; see at <a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>).</body></html>
