Those who understand it but of one field, watered both with the rain of heaven, and the springs that issued out of the earth, countenance the allusion commonly made to this, when we pray for spiritual and heavenly blessings which relate to our souls, as blessings of the upper springs, and those which relate to the body and the life that now is, as blessings of the nether springs. All the blessings, both of the upper and the nether springs, belong to the children of God. As related to Christ, they have them freely given of the Father, for the lot of their inheritance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The name Debir belonged to two other places; namely,, that named in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a>, between Jerusalem and Jericho, and the Gadite town mentioned in <a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>. The Debir here meant appears (and its site has been conjecturally placed at Dhaheriyeh (Conder)) to have been situated in the mountain district south of Hebron. It was one of the towns afterward assigned to the Levites. Its other name <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>, "Kirjath-sannah", i. e. perhaps, "city of palm branches," or "city of law, or sacred learning," no less than the two given in the text, would indicate that Debir was an ancient seat of Canaanite learning, for Debir probably is equivalent to "oracle," and Kirjath-sepher means "city of books." This plurality of names marks the importance of the town, as the inducement held out in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-16.htm">Joshua 15:16</a>, by Caleb, to secure its capture (compare <a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>), points to its strength. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jos 15:16-20.

Mount Seir is the ridge of rock to the south-west of Kureyet el Enab, a lofty ridge composed or rugged peaks, with a wild and desolate appearance, upon which Saris and Mishir are situated (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 155). Chesalon is the present Kesla on the summit of a mountain, an elevated point of the lofty ridge between Wady Ghurb and Ismail, south-west of Kureyet el Enab (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 154). Beth-shemesh (i.e., sun-house), a priests' city in the territory of Judah (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>), is the same as Ir-shemesh (<a href="/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>), a place on the border of Dan, where the ark was deposited by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>.), and where Amaziah was slain by Joash (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11-12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>). It was conquered by the Philistines in the time of Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). According to the Onom. it was ten Roman miles, i.e., four hours, from Eleutheropolis towards Nicopolis. It is the present Ain Shems, upon a plateau in a splendid situation, two hours and a half to the south-west of Kesla (Rob. Pal. iii. p. 17; Bibl. Res. p. 153). Timnah, or Timnatah, belonged to Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-43.htm">Joshua 19:43</a>); and it was thence that Samson fetched his wife (<a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1</a>.). It is the present Tibneh, three-quarters of an hour to the west of Ain Shems (Rob. Pal. i. p. 344).</body></html>
