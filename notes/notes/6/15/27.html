It was a line of steppe-land, with certain patches here and there that admitted of cultivation, but in which tracts of heath prevailed, for the most part covered with grass and bushes, where only grazing could be carried on with any success. The term which Eusebius and Jerome employ for Negeb in the Onom. is Daromas, but they carry it farther northwards than the Negeb of the Old Testament (see Reland, Pal. Ill. pp. 185ff.). The numerous towns mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21-32</a> as standing in the Negeb, may none of them have been large or of any importance. In the list before us we find that, as a rule, several names are closely connected together by the copula vav, and in this way the whole may be divided into four separate groups of towns.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21-23</a><p>First group of nine places. - <a href="/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>.

Kabzeel: the home of the hero Benaiah (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>), probably identical with Jakabzeel, which is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25</a> in connection with Dibon, but has not been discovered. This also applies to Eder and Jagur.</body></html>
