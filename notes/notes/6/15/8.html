It was in this ravine, more particularly at Tophet in the more wild and precipitous part of it toward the east, that the later kings of Judah offered the sacrifices of children to Moloch (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>, etc.). After these places had been defiled by Josiah, Tophet and the whole valley of Hinnom were held in abomination by the Jews, and the name of the latter was used to denote the place of eternal torment <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>. The Greek term Gehenna (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  geenna) is in fact formed from the Hebrew &#1492;&#1504;&#1501; &#1490;&#1497;&#1488;  gay' h&#305;&#770;nno&#770;m, "valley of Hinnom." Hinnom is regarded either as the name of some ancient hero, or as an appellative ( "groaning" or "moaning"), bestowed on the spot because of the cries of the victims here offered to Moloch, and of the drums with which those cries were drowned.<p>The valley of the giants - Rather "the plain of Rephaim." This plain, named after an ancient and gigantic tribe of the land <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>, lies southwestward of Jerusalem, and is terminated by a slight rocky ridge forming the brow of the valley of Hinnom.

Which belonged to a man of that name formerly; and was near Jerusalem, placed by Jerom (l) to the east of it; but Reland (m) rather thinks it is to the south. It was infamous for the sacrifices of children to Moloch in it, by burning them, or causing them to pass through fire: hence, in allusion to it, hell fire is often in the New Testament called "Geenna", <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a> <a href="/luke/12-5.htm">Luke 12:5</a>; this border from the salt sea, and from Jordan, is all along said to "go up", because from hence to Jerusalem was an ascent, that lying on higher ground: <p>unto the south side of the Jebusite; of the place the Jebusite inhabited: <p>the same is Jerusalem; which was formerly called Jebus, from the inhabitants of it; yea, Jebusi, as here, and so may intend not the inhabitants, but the place, see <a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>; and here the Jebusites lived, at least in some part of it, until the time of David, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>, <p>and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward: which is generally supposed to be the mount Moriah: <p>which is at the end of the valley of the giants, northward: the valley of Rephaim, as it is called <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>, and here Mount Moriah, as it was to the west of the valley of Hinnom, it was to the north of the valley of Rephaim; which valley, as Josephus (n) says, was not far from Jerusalem, twenty furlongs from it. Some late travellers (o) tell us it lies in the way from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, and is not above two hours' ride from the former. From this account it appears, as Jarchi remarks, that Jerusalem was not within the line, and was not in the border of Judah, but of Benjamin, which tribe lay to the north of Judah: it seems indeed to have been one part of it in the tribe of Judah, and the other in the tribe of Benjamin; though the Jews frequently say it did not belong to either tribe. <p>(l) De loc.

The direction accordingly runs S. S. W. of Jerusalem, where the valley mentioned lies. Nothing is known of this Hinnom. Possibly he was some ancient hero, who had encamped here, and from whom it was called “<span class="ital">Ge-Ben-Hinnom</span>,” “the Ravine of the son of Hinnom,” whence came “Ge-Hinnom,” and so “Gehenna.” It is a deep retired glen, shut in by rugged cliffs, with the bleak mountain-sides rising over all. Here (<span class="ital">a</span>) Solomon erected high places for Moloch (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>), and (<span class="ital">b</span>) in the times of Ahaz and Manasseh it became notorious as the scene of the barbarous rites of that deity and of Chemosh, when the idolatrous inhabitants of Jerusalem cast their sons and daughters into the red-hot arms of a monster idol of brass placed at the opening of the ravine (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). To put an end to these abominations the place was polluted by Josiah, who spread over it human bones and other corruptions (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile....">2 Kings 23:13-14</a>), from which time it seems to have become the common cesspool of the city. These inhuman rites and subsequent ceremonial defilement caused the later Jews to regard it with horror and detestation, and they applied the name given to the valley to <span class="ital">the place of torment</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the same is Jerusalem</span>] As Bethel was in earlier times called <span class="ital">Luz</span> (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm" title="And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.">Genesis 28:19</a>), and Bethlehem was called <span class="ital">Ephrath</span> (<a href="/genesis/35-16.htm" title="And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.">Genesis 35:16</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>), so Jerusalem was called <span class="ital">Jebus</span> (<a href="/judges/19-11.htm" title="And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.">Jdg 19:11</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-4.htm" title="And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.">1 Chronicles 11:4</a>).

It was a “valley-plain,” extending in a S.W. direction from Jerusalem to Mar Elias, spacious enough to serve as a camp for an army. Here (<span class="ital">a</span>) David twice encountered the Philistines and inflicted a destruction upon them so signal that it gave the place a new name, Baal-perazim = “<span class="ital">the plain of Bursts</span>” or “<span class="ital">Destructions</span>” (<a href="/context/2_samuel/5-17.htm" title="But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold....">2 Samuel 5:17-20</a>).

In the former part it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (see note on last verse). The word here used signifies originally <span class="accented">depth</span>, and is applied to wide valleys embosomed among lofty hills. Such were the valley of Elah (<a href="/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2, 19</a>); the King's Dale (<a href="/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>); the valley of Siddim (<a href="/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>), of Jezreel (<a href="/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>). "The word Emek shows that this was neither a winter torrent nor a narrow, dry ravine, and it is best identified with its traditional site, the shallow basin west of the watershed south of Jerusalem, now called el Bukei'a" (Conder). We read of this valley in <a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18, 22</a>. From these passages we may gather a confirmation of the view above expressed, that the valley here meant is an open valley, since only in such a valley could the Philistine army take up a position. It gradually narrows towards the southwest. On the south it extends as far as Bethlehem.
