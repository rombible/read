The mountains, which are of limestone, rise to a height of near 3,000 feet. At present, the highlands of Judah present a somewhat dreary and monotonous aspect. The peaks are for the most part barren, though crowned almost everywhere with the ruins of ancient towns, and bearing on their sides marks of former cultivation. Many of the valleys, especially toward the south, are, however, still very productive. The towns here enumerated are given in six groups.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48-51</a><p>First group: towns on the southwest. Dannah (is identified with "Idnah" (Conder)).
