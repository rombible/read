Here begins a fourth division, or list, of the cities in the mountains. Halhul Jerom calls Ehul, and says (w) there was in his time in the country belonging to Aelia (or Jerusalem) a village by the name of Ahula, near Hebron; and <p>Bethzur, Jerom says (x), was then called Bethseron, a village as you go from Aelia to Hebron, in the twentieth mile, near which was a fountain at the bottom of a mount, where it is said the eunuch was baptized by Philip: he makes mention of another village called Bethsur in the tribe of Judah, a mile from Eleutheropolis. In the Apocrypha:"So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura, which was a strong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs, and he laid sore siege unto it.'' (2 Maccabees 11:5)it is said to be but five furlongs from Jerusalem, but it must have been at a greater distance: <p>Gedor, of this city; see Gill on <a href="/joshua/12-13.htm">Joshua 12:13</a>. <p>(w) De loc.

Duma, according to Eusebius the largest place in the Daromas in his time, and seventeen miles from Eleutheropolis, is probably the ruined village of Daumeh, by the Wady Dilbeh (Rob. i. p. 314), which is fourteen miles in a straight line to the south-east of Eleutheropolis according to the map. Es'an (Eshean) can hardly be identified with Asan (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a>), as Van de Velde supposes, but is more likely Korasan (<a href="/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a>). In that case we might connect it with the ruins of Khursah, on the north-west of Daumeh, two hours and a half to the south-west of Hebron (Rob. iii. p. 5). As the Septuagint reading is &#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;, Knobel conjectures that Eshean is a corrupt reading for Shema (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-43.htm">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>), and connects it with the ruins of Simia, on the south of Daumeh (Seetzen, iii. 28, and Rob. iii.App.).</body></html>
