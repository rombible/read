Its name signifies "red" and is explained by Jerome as given because of the frequent bloodshed there by robbers. This road is the scene of the parable of the Good Samaritan. Possibly the name may be due to some aboriginal tribe of "red men," who held their ground in these fastnesses after the invaders had driven them from the face of the country elsewhere.<p>En-shemesh - i. e. "fountain of the sun;" no doubt that now called "the Fountain of the Apostles," about two miles from Jerusalem, and the only well on the road to Jericho.<p>En-rogel - i. e.

It was here that Jonathan and Ahimaaz concealed themselves after the rebellion of Absalom, in order to procure tidings for David, and here Adonijah gave a feast to his adherents preparatory to making an attempt on the crown (compare the marginal references). It is probably the modern "Fountain of the Virgin," the only real spring near Jerusalem, from which the Pool of Siloam is supplied.

It was four miles distant from Jericho to the west, according to Adrichomius (d), and was a mountain, and part of the mountains of Engaddi: <p>which is on the south side of the river; which some take to be the brook Kidron; but that is not very likely, being too near Jerusalem for this place: it may be rendered "the valley", so Jarchi, either the valley of Achor, before mentioned, or however a valley that ran along by the mount or ascent of Adummim, which lay to the south of it: <p>and the border passed to the waters of Enshemesh: or the "fountain of the sun"; but of it we have no account what and where it was. It might be so called, because dedicated to the sun by the idolatrous Canaanites, or because of the sun's influence on the waters of it. Our city, Bath, is, by Antoninus (e), called "aquae solis", the waters of the sun; though there is a fountain in Cyrene, so called, for a reason just the reverse, it being, as Mela (f) and Pliny (g) affirm, hottest the middle of the night, and then grows cooler by little and little; and when it is light is cold, and when the sun is risen is colder still, and at noon exceeding cold; and, according to Vossius (h), it is the same with the fountain of Jupiter Ammon; and so it appears to be from Herodotus (i), by whom it is also called the "fountain of the sun", and which he places in Thebes, though Pliny distinguishes them: <p>and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel; which signifies "the fountain of the fuller"; so the Targum renders it, and probably was a fountain where fullers cleansed their clothes; and was called Rogel, as Jarchi and Kimchi say, because they used to tread them with their feet when they washed them. This was a place near Jerusalem, as appears from <a href="/1_kings/1-9.htm">1 Kings 1:9</a>; near to which perhaps was the fuller's monument, at the corner tower of Jerusalem, Josephus (k) speaks of, as there was also a place not far from it called the fuller's field, <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>; according to Bunting (l), it had its name from travellers washing their feet here. <p>(c) De loc.

It was near this well that (<span class="ital">a</span>) Jonathan and Ahimaaz lay hid during the rebellion of Absalom, in order to collect and send news to David (<a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2 Samuel 17:17</a>); and (<span class="ital">b</span>) afterwards Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by En-rogel, when he conspired to seize the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/1-9.htm" title="And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:">1 Kings 1:9</a>). “In itself it is a singular work of ancient enterprise. The shaft, sunk through the solid rock in the bed of the Kidron, is 125 feet deep. The idea of digging such a well at that precise spot may have been suggested by the fact, that, after very great rains, water sometimes rises nearly to the top, and then flows out into the valley below, a strong brook capable of driving a mill. This, however, soon ceases, and the water in the well subsides to less than half its depth. From that point a stream seems to run constantly across it, and pass down the valley under the rock.… The water is pure and entirely sweet, quite different from that of Siloam, which proves that there is no connection between them. I have seen the water gushing out like a mill-stream, some fifteen rods south of the well; and then the whole valley was alive with people bathing in it, and indulging in every species of hilarity.” Thomson’s <span class="ital">Land and the Book</span>, pp. 658, 659.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Toward Debir.</span> Not the Debir of ch. 10. <span class="cmt_word">The valley of Achor</span> (see <a href="/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>). This is now the Wady Kelt. <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal</span>. Keil says that this is not the Gilgal where the Israelites first encamped. It is called Geliloth, or "circles," in <a href="/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>, where the same place is obviously meant as here. The question is one of some difficulty. If it be not the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>, which is described as being eastward of Jericho, still less can it be Jiljiliah (see note on Joshua 9:6) which was near Bethel, and therefore on the northern border of Benjamin. In that case the only supposition that will meet the facts in this case is that Gilgal, which signifies a wheel or circle, was the common name given to all the Israelitish encampments. But there seems no reason to doubt that the Gilgal of <a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a> is meant. This is Ewald's view in his 'History of Israel,' 2:245. <span class="cmt_word">Adummim,</span> or "the red (places)," has been identified with Maledomim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Maaleh Adummim, or Talat el Dumm (Conder), on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Jerome explains it as "ascensus ruforum sen rubentium propter sanguinem qui iltic erebro a latronibus funditur." Every one will at once call to mind the narrative in St. <a href="/luke/10.htm">Luke 10</a>, which has no doubt suggested this explanation. But at one particular point in the route from Jerusalem to Jericho a "large mass of purplish rock" is found (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 424, note). It was called "terra ruffa," "the red earth," from the colour of the ground, and recent travellers state that it is called the "red field" still, from this cause. Conder tells us the name is derived from "the brick-red marks here found amid a district of red chalk (see also Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake in Pal. Expl. Fund Quart. Paper, April, 1874). So Knobel speaks, on the authority of numberless travellers of "der rothen Farbe des dortigen gesteins." And the Quarterly Paper just quoted mentions the "bright limestone and marl." <span class="cmt_word">Which is on the south aide of the river.</span> The <span class="accented">Nahal</span>, or summer torrent, in the original; "the Wady Kelt, south of Riha" (Knobel). <span class="cmt_word">The waters of Eu-shemesh,</span> or the fountain of the sun, supposed to be Kin Hand, or the "Apostles' well," near Bethany. There is an <span class="accented">Arak</span> (cave) <span class="accented">esh Shems</span>, about two miles off. All these places have been identified on or near the pilgrims' route to the Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">Enrogel</span> (see ch. 18:17). It was close by Jerusalem, and was where Jonathan and Ahimaaz lingered to gain tidings for David, and where Adonijah repaired to hold the great feast when he endeavoured to obtain the kingdom. "Now Kin Um ed Deraj in the Kedron Valley" (Conder). Vandevelde supposes it to be Bir Eyub, Joab's well, at the point where the Kedron Valley meets the Gai Hinnom. This seems most probable. <span class="cmt_word">The valley of the son of Hinnom.</span> The word here for valley (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) signifies properly a deep cleft in the rock, through which no water flows. The valley of Hinnom has been generally taken to be the deep valley running from west to east, and lying to the west and south of Jerusalem, described by Tobler as forked at its northwestern end, bending to the southward about its middle, and joining the valley of Jehoshaphat at its eastern extremity. In the Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund for October, 1878, however, it is contended that the now partially filled up Tyropceon Valley, running through the city, is the valley or ravine of Hinnom. The manner in which this is demonstrated reminds the reader somewhat of a proposition in Euclid, and the question arises whether Euclid's method be exactly applicable to a point of this kind. The arguments used are not without force, but no notice is taken of the peculiar position of the valley of Rephaim (see next note but one), which, we learn from the sacred historian, was so placed that its extremity coincided with the mountain which closed the ravine of Hinnom at its western side. If the Tyropoeon Valley answers to this description, it may be accepted as the true valley of Hinnom, but not otherwise. Mr. Birch incorrectly cites Gesenius in favour of his theory; and the most recent discoveries appear to have thrown discredit upon it. The most weighty argument in favour of his theory is that a comparison of <a href="/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a> with <a href="/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3-8</a>, leads to the supposition that Jerusalem was partly in Benjamin and partly in Judah (see, however, <a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). This valley, called sometimes Tophet, and sometimes, by a corruption of the Hebrew, Gehenna, whatever its situation may have been, is conspicuous in the after history of Israel. This deep and retired spot was the seat of all the worst abominations of the idol worship to which the Jews afterwards became addicted. Here Solomon reared high places for Moloch (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>). Here children were sacrificed at the hideous rites of that demon god (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2, 4</a>). It was defiled by Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10, 13, 14</a>), and was looked upon in later times as an abomination (see <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>).
