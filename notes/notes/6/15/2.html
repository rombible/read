Although the points mentioned along the border are not all certainly known, there is no doubt that the great mountain wall which extends from the Dead Sea to the water-shed south of Rehoboth (<span class= "ital">Er-Ruheibeh</span>) formed the natural and recognised boundary of Palestine, while the river of Egypt (<a href="/joshua/15-4.htm" title="From there it passed toward Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.">Joshua 15:4</a>) is generally supposed to be the present <span class= "ital">Wâdy-el’-Arish, </span>the northern boundary between Syria and Egypt.

It is here given in still greater detail. It commenced (<span class="ital">a</span>) from the “shore (or end) of the Salt Sea,” or more exactly, <span class="ital">the tongue which turneth southward</span> (see margin), “fro the tonge of it that biholdith to the south,” Wyclif. By this “tongue” is meant the southern portion of the Dead Sea reaching from the peninsula, which runs at a great distance from the Sea on the west of Karah, and extends quite to the south point at the so-called Salt-hill and Salt-Marsh.” Keil. “We were now in the most desolate and dreary corner of that desolate shore, without one trace of vegetable life, not even a stray salsola, or salicornia, to relieve the flat sand beds. The sand and loam of the shore was deep and heavy; our horses sank at each step above the fetlocks, and not until we were wet through, could we return to the Salt Mountains on our right.… The whole ridge (of the mountain) is of pure rock-salt, perhaps 200 feet high, and covered by a layer of chalky marl and natron, about 50 or 60 feet thick.… The salt deposit is similar in its nature and geological position to the salt rocks of Cheshire, and the new red sandstone of England.” Tristram’s <span class="ital">Land of Moab</span>, pp. 39, 40, 41.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The shore of the salt sea.</span> Literally, the <span class="accented">extremity, i.e.</span>, the <span class="accented">south</span> extremity. <span class="cmt_word">From the bay.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">tongue</span> (so margin).

It is called the Lisan. Whoever was the writer of the Book of Joshua, these details prove him to have had an accurate acquaintance with the geography of Palestine. He was no priestly inventor of fables attached to the temple at Jerusalem. Canon Tristram gives a vivid description of the neighbourhood in his 'Land of Israel,' ch. 15. The ridge of Jebel Usdum - one large mass of rock salt - on the west of this "tongue" of water, the salt marsh of the Sebkha on the southwest, with its treeless waste - "not a plant or a leaf could be seen save just under the hills" - and its mirage like that of Sahara, the barren outline of the Lisan itself, to the eastward rising to an elevation of from five to six hundred feet, and the fertile oasis of the Ghor-es-Safieh at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, give an unique character to this remarkable region. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehovah swore at that time, that the land upon which his (Caleb's) foot had trodden should be an inheritance for him and his sons for ever. This oath is not mentioned in <a href="/numbers/14-20.htm">Numbers 14:20</a>., nor yet in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35-36</a>, where Moses repeats the account of the whole occurrence to the people. For the oath of Jehovah mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>, viz., that none of the murmuring people should see the land of Canaan, but that Caleb alone should come thither and his seed should possess it, cannot be the one referred to, as the promise given to Caleb in this oath does not relate to the possession of Hebron in particular, but to the land of Canaan generally, "the land which Jehovah had sworn to their fathers." We must assume, therefore, that in addition to what is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>, God gave a special promise to Caleb, which is passed over there, with reference to the possession of Hebron itself, and that Joshua, who heard it at the time, is here reminded of that promise by Caleb. This particular promise from God was closely related to the words with which Caleb endeavoured to calm the minds of the people when they rose up against Moses (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>), viz., by saying to them, "We are well able to overcome it," notwithstanding the Anakites who dwelt in Hebron and had filled the other spies with such great alarm on account of their gigantic size. With reference to this the Lord had promised that very land to Caleb for his inheritance. Upon this promise Caleb founded his request (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10-12</a>) that Joshua would give him these mountains, of which Joshua had heard at that time that there were Anakites and large fortified cities there, inasmuch as, although forty-five years had elapsed since God had spoken these words, and he was now eighty-five years old, he was quite as strong as he had been then. From the words, "The Lord hath kept me alive these forty-five years," Theodoret justly infers, that the conquest of Canaan by Joshua was completed in seven years, since God spake these words towards the end of the second year after the exodus from Egypt, and therefore thirty-eight years before the entrance into Canaan. The clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (<a href="/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>) is also dependent upon &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1491;: viz., "these forty-five years that Israel has wandered in the desert" (on this use of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, see Ewald, 331, c.). The expression is a general one, and the years occupied in the conquest of Canaan, during which Israel had not yet entered into peaceful possession of the promised land, are reckoned as forming part of the years of wandering in the desert. As another reason for his request, Caleb adds in <a href="/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a> : "I am still as strong to-day as at that time; as my strength was then, so is it now for war, and to go out and in" (see <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>). </body></html>
