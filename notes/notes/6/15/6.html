It is still known as <span class="accented">Ain Hadjla</span> or <span class="accented">Hajla</span>, where, says Keil, a beautiful spring of fresh and clear water is to be found. The place lies about two miles from Jordan. Beth-hogla means "the house of the partridge." "Leaving the probable site of the ancient Gilgal and advancing southward along the pilgrims' route to the Jordan, an hour and a quarter brings us to the spring Kin Hajla, in a small and well-watered grove" (Ritter). He adds, "Robinson and Wilson both recognised in the name Hails the ancient Canaanitish city Beth-hogla." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-arabah.</span> Or "the house of the Arabah" or desert. Its site is not known (see ver. 61 and <a href="/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18, 22</a>). The Beth-arabah in ver. 61, however, must have been another place, since it was in the wilderness of Judaea, not far from the Dead Sea. <span class="cmt_word">The stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.</span> All we know of this stone is that it was westward of Beth-arabah. The boundary of Benjamin in ch. 18, is mentioned in precisely reverse order, and since here the stone was on the ascent from Beth-araba, and there (ver. 17) it is described as on the descent from Geliloth, it must have been on the side of the declivity. Of Bohan nothing further is known. We must understand here, as in many other places of Scripture, <span class="accented">descendant</span> by "son" (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This inheritance, the historian adds, was awarded to Caleb because he had followed the God of Israel with such fidelity. - In <a href="/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a> there follows another notice of the earlier name of Hebron (see at <a href="/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>). The expression &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (before), like the words "to this day," applies to the time when the book was composed, at which time the name Kirjath-arba had long since fallen into disuse; so that it by no means follows that the name Hebron was not so old as the name Kirjath-arba, which was given to Hebron for the first time when it was taken by Arba, "the great man among the Anakites," i.e., the strongest and most renowned of the Anakites (vid., <a href="/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13</a>). The remark, "and the land had rest from war," is repeated again at the close of this account from <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>, to show that although there were Anakites still dwelling in Hebron whom Caleb hoped to exterminate, the work of distributing the land by lot was not delayed in consequence, but was carried out in perfect peace. </body></html>
