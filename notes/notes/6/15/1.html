Borders of the Lot of Judah.<p>1. This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah&#8212;In what manner the lot was drawn on this occasion the sacred historian does not say; but it is probable that the method adopted was similar to that described in Jos 18:10. Though the general survey of the country had not been completed, some rough draft or delineation of the first conquered part must have been made, and satisfactory evidence obtained that it was large enough to furnish three cantons, before all the tribes cast lots for them; and they fell to Judah, Ephraim, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The lot of Judah came first, in token of the pre-eminence of that tribe over all the others; and its destined superiority thus received the visible sanction of God. The territory, assigned to it as a possession, was large and extensive, being bounded on the south by the wilderness of Zin, and the southern extremity of the Salt Sea (Nu 34:3-5); on the east, by that sea, extending to the point where it receives the waters of the Jordan; on the north, by a line drawn nearly parallel to Jerusalem, across the country, from the northern extremity of the Salt Sea to the southern limits of the Philistine territory, and to the Mediterranean; and on the west this sea was its boundary, as far as Sihor (Wady El-Arish).The borders of the lot of Judah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/joshua/15-1.htm" title="This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast....">Joshua 15:1-12</a></span>.

That this work of casting lots was transacted with great seriousness and solemnity, in God’s presence, with prayer and appeal to him for the decision of the matter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That although an exact survey of this land was not taken till <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/18-4.htm" title="Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.">Joshua 18:4</a>,5</span>, yet there was, and must needs be, a general description of it, and a division thereof into nine parts and a half; which as far as they could guess, were equal either in quantity or in quality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That the lot did not at this time so peremptorily and unchangeably determine each tribe, that their portion could neither be increased nor diminished; as is manifest, because after Judah’s lot was fixed, Simeon’s lot was taken out of it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/19-9.htm" title="Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.">Joshua 19:9</a></span>, though after the land was more distinctly known and surveyed, <span class="bld"> Jos 18</span>, it is likely the bounds were more certain and fixed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That the lot determined only in general what part or quarter of the land belonged to each tribe, but left the particulars to be determined by Joshua and Eleazar, &c. For the manner of this lottery, it is probably conceived that there were two urns or pots, into one of which were put the names of all the tribes, each in a distinct paper, and into the other the names of each portion described; then Eleazar, or some other person, drew out first the name of one of the tribes out of one pot, and then the name of one portion out of the other pot, and that portion was appropriated to that tribe; and so in the rest.

This wilderness was on the border of Edom (<a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>). Thence the border of Judah (which here includes the small portion afterwards allotted to Simeon) extended to the utmost limits of the south (see <a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>). A wall of mountains extends southwestward from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and formed the natural boundary of Judaea. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehovah swore at that time, that the land upon which his (Caleb's) foot had trodden should be an inheritance for him and his sons for ever. This oath is not mentioned in <a href="/numbers/14-20.htm">Numbers 14:20</a>., nor yet in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35-36</a>, where Moses repeats the account of the whole occurrence to the people. For the oath of Jehovah mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>, viz., that none of the murmuring people should see the land of Canaan, but that Caleb alone should come thither and his seed should possess it, cannot be the one referred to, as the promise given to Caleb in this oath does not relate to the possession of Hebron in particular, but to the land of Canaan generally, "the land which Jehovah had sworn to their fathers." We must assume, therefore, that in addition to what is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>, God gave a special promise to Caleb, which is passed over there, with reference to the possession of Hebron itself, and that Joshua, who heard it at the time, is here reminded of that promise by Caleb. This particular promise from God was closely related to the words with which Caleb endeavoured to calm the minds of the people when they rose up against Moses (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>), viz., by saying to them, "We are well able to overcome it," notwithstanding the Anakites who dwelt in Hebron and had filled the other spies with such great alarm on account of their gigantic size. With reference to this the Lord had promised that very land to Caleb for his inheritance. Upon this promise Caleb founded his request (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10-12</a>) that Joshua would give him these mountains, of which Joshua had heard at that time that there were Anakites and large fortified cities there, inasmuch as, although forty-five years had elapsed since God had spoken these words, and he was now eighty-five years old, he was quite as strong as he had been then. From the words, "The Lord hath kept me alive these forty-five years," Theodoret justly infers, that the conquest of Canaan by Joshua was completed in seven years, since God spake these words towards the end of the second year after the exodus from Egypt, and therefore thirty-eight years before the entrance into Canaan. The clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (<a href="/joshua/14-10.htm">Joshua 14:10</a>) is also dependent upon &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1491;: viz., "these forty-five years that Israel has wandered in the desert" (on this use of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, see Ewald, 331, c.). The expression is a general one, and the years occupied in the conquest of Canaan, during which Israel had not yet entered into peaceful possession of the promised land, are reckoned as forming part of the years of wandering in the desert. As another reason for his request, Caleb adds in <a href="/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a> : "I am still as strong to-day as at that time; as my strength was then, so is it now for war, and to go out and in" (see <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>). </body></html>
