But we do not here find Bethlehem, afterwards the city of David, and ennobled by the birth of our Lord Jesus in it.

It is possibly to be looked for at "El-Kuseir", a spot where the various routes toward different parts of the Negeb converge, and which is occupied by the Arab tribe the "Dhullam", a word identical with Telem in its consonants. Bealoth is probably the "Baalath-beer - Ramath of the south" <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-8.htm">Joshua 19:8</a>, and was one of the towns afterward assigned to the Simeonites.

"A field:" in <a href="/judges/1-14.htm">Judges 1:14</a> we find "the field," as the writer had the particular field in his mind. This was not "the field belonging to the town of Debir" (Knobel), for Othniel had no need to ask for this, as it naturally went with the town, but a piece of land that could be cultivated, or, as is shown in what follows, one that was not deficient in springs of water. What Othniel did is not stated, but only what Achzah did to attain her end, possibly because her husband could not make up his mind to present the request to her father. She sprang from the ass upon which she had ridden when her father brought her to Othniel. &#1510;&#1504;&#1495;, which only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>, and in the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm">Judges 1:14</a>, is hardly connected with &#1510;&#1504;&#1506;, to be lowly or humble (Ges.); the primary meaning is rather that suggested by Frst, to force one's self, to press away, or further; and hence in this case the meaning is, to spring down quickly from the animal she had ridden, like &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; in <a href="/genesis/24-64.htm">Genesis 24:64</a>. Alighting from an animal was a special sign of reverence, from which Caleb inferred that his daughter had some particular request to make of him, and therefore asked her what she wanted: "What is to thee?" or, "What wilt thou?" She then asked him for a blessing (as in <a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>); "for," she added, "thou hast given me into barren land." &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (rendered a south land) is accus. loci; so that negeb is not to be taken as a proper name, signifying the southernmost district of Canaan (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>, etc.), but as an appellative, "the dry or arid land," as in <a href="/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>. "Give me springs of water," i.e., a piece of land with springs of water in it. Caleb then gave her the "upper springs and lower springs:" this was the name given to a tract of land in which there were springs on both the higher and lower ground. It must have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of Debir, though, like the town itself, it has not yet been found. </body></html>
