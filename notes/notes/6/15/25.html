Two places bearing the common topographical appellation, Hazor ("enclosure") are here mentioned and distinguished as "Hazor Hadattah" and "Kerioth-Hezron," otherwise termed Hazor, simply: the former has been identified by some with "El-Hudhera"; the latter is probably the modern "El-Kuryetein". Kerioth, prefixed to a name, bespeaks military occupation, as Hazor points to pastoral pursuits. The place would therefore seem to be an ancient pastoral settlement which had been fortified by the Anakims, and called accordingly Kerioth; to which name the men of Judah, after they had captured it, added that of Hezron, in honor of one of their leading ancestors (compare <a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18</a>).

According to the Targum, two cities only are here meant, which reads, "and Hazorhadattah, and Keriothhezron, which is Hazor"; and this reading seems to be right; there were three Hazors in this tribe, one in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23</a>, and two more here, which are distinguished; the first is called Hazorhadattah, or new Hazor; of which Jerom says (e), there is a village at this day called Asor, in the borders of Ashkelon, to the east of it, which fell to the lot of the tribe of Judah; the Scripture makes mention of it, calling: it new Asor, to distinguish it from the old; and Keriothhezron is the same with Hezron, <a href="/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a>; and had also the name of Hezron.

"A field:" in <a href="/judges/1-14.htm">Judges 1:14</a> we find "the field," as the writer had the particular field in his mind. This was not "the field belonging to the town of Debir" (Knobel), for Othniel had no need to ask for this, as it naturally went with the town, but a piece of land that could be cultivated, or, as is shown in what follows, one that was not deficient in springs of water. What Othniel did is not stated, but only what Achzah did to attain her end, possibly because her husband could not make up his mind to present the request to her father. She sprang from the ass upon which she had ridden when her father brought her to Othniel. &#1510;&#1504;&#1495;, which only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>, and in the parallel passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm">Judges 1:14</a>, is hardly connected with &#1510;&#1504;&#1506;, to be lowly or humble (Ges.); the primary meaning is rather that suggested by Frst, to force one's self, to press away, or further; and hence in this case the meaning is, to spring down quickly from the animal she had ridden, like &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; in <a href="/genesis/24-64.htm">Genesis 24:64</a>. Alighting from an animal was a special sign of reverence, from which Caleb inferred that his daughter had some particular request to make of him, and therefore asked her what she wanted: "What is to thee?" or, "What wilt thou?" She then asked him for a blessing (as in <a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>); "for," she added, "thou hast given me into barren land." &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (rendered a south land) is accus. loci; so that negeb is not to be taken as a proper name, signifying the southernmost district of Canaan (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>, etc.), but as an appellative, "the dry or arid land," as in <a href="/psalms/126-4.htm">Psalm 126:4</a>. "Give me springs of water," i.e., a piece of land with springs of water in it. Caleb then gave her the "upper springs and lower springs:" this was the name given to a tract of land in which there were springs on both the higher and lower ground. It must have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of Debir, though, like the town itself, it has not yet been found. </body></html>
