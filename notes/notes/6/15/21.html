The term here used (see above, ver. 19) for "south" is the one which has the signification of dryness. It is, however, occasionally used in a less strict sense, as in <a href="/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24</a>. Though the south country was in the main an arid region, yet its intersection by numerous wadys, with their attendant streams, provided fertile spots at intervals, where the traveller might rest, cattle might be watered, and corn and other produce raised. The only places of any importance in Scripture history mentioned here are Beersheba (see <a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>), and Hormah (see <a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>; and cf. <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>; and <a href="/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>). This last passage explains why the city is mentioned among the cities of Simeon as well as Judah, and is another instance of the remarkable accuracy of our author. Ziklag is famous as the residence of David (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). It is noteworthy that t was given to him by Achish, king of Gath, in whose possession it therefore was at that time. It was burnt by the roving hands of Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Hebron Caleb went against the Inhabitants of Debir, to the south of Hebron. This town, which has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="/joshua/10-38.htm">Joshua 10:38</a>), must have been very strong and hard to conquer; for Caleb offered a prize to the conqueror, promising to give his daughter Achzah for a wife to any one that should take it, just as Saul afterwards promised to give his daughter to the conqueror of Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>).</body></html>
