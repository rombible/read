It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the conquest of Bashan, see especially <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>, etc. and notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. With whom&#8212;Hebrew, "him." The antecedent is evidently to Manasseh, not, however, the half-tribe just mentioned, but the other half; for the historian, led, as it were, by the sound of the word, breaks off to describe the possessions beyond Jordan already assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half of Manasseh (see on [190]Nu 32:1; [191]Nu 32:33; also see De 3:8-17). It may be proper to remark that it was wise to put these boundaries on record. In case of any misunderstanding or dispute arising about the exact limits of each district or property, an appeal could always be made to this authoritative document, and a full knowledge as well as grateful sense obtained of what they had received from God (Ps 16:5, 6).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto the half tribe of Manasseh; </span> not that they desired it, as Reuben and Gad did, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/32-1.htm" title="Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;">Numbers 32:1</a></span>, but partly as a recompence to Machir the Manessite for his valiant acts against Og; and partly for the better security and defence of the other two tribes, by so considerable an accession to them, which also was without any inconvenience to them, because the country was too large for the two tribes of Reuben and Gad. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh,....

The Possession of the Half Tribe of Manasseh<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">the half tribe of Manasseh</span>] “The fact that it is always called a half tribe appears curious, especially on comparison with the similar, yet widely different, case of Dan, which sent out to the north an army which surprised the Phœnician town of Laish.” Ewald, 11. 299.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The halftribe of Manasseh.</span> The word used for "tribe" in the first and second half of this verse is not the same. Some German critics have derived an argument for the hypothesis that the historical and geographical portions of the book are not by the same hand, from the supposed fact that the former of these words is used almost exclusively in the first, or historical portion, and the latter in the second, or geographical portion, of the book. The word "almost" would be <span class="accented">almost</span> sufficient to overthrow the theory, but this verse is an insuperable objection to it. Is it seriously contended that one half of this verse is taken from one author, and the other from another? Or is it possible that the writer of the book may actually have understood the language he was using, and meant to use the two words in somewhat different senses? Gesenius, it is true, would explain the words as being precisely synonymous. But his own etymological remarks are fatal to his theory. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> the latter of the two words, is a <span class="accented">bough</span>, or <span class="accented">shoot</span> (derived from a word signifying to <span class="accented">grow</span>), capable of throwing out blossoms (<a href="/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a>). It refers, therefore, to the natural descent of the tribe from Manasseh their father. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is allied to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e4;&#x5d8;</span>; to judge, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and perhaps the English <span class="accented">shaft</span>, and signifies a rod as the emblem of authority. Thus it is used in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, of a royal sceptre. So <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, an iron sceptre, <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>. Thus the latter word has reference to the tribe as an organised community, the former to it in reference to its ancestral derivation. This view would seem to be supported by ver. 24, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> of Gad is further explained to mean his <span class="accented">sons and their families</span>, as well as by this verse, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is used absolutely, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> in connection with the family <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And (this) was the boundary of the sons of Reuben, the Jordan and its territory," i.e., the Jordan, or rather land adjoining it. The meaning is, that the territory of Reuben, viz., with the places mentioned last (<a href="/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20</a>), reached to the territory of the Jordan; for so far as the principal part was concerned, it was on the east of the Dead Sea, as it only reached from the Arnon to Heshbon, i.e., up to the latitude of the northern extremity of the Dead Sea.
