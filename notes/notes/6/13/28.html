It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The border of Debir - Rather perhaps "the border of Lidbir," which is regarded as identical with the Lo-debar of <a href="/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, one of the towns from which provisions were brought to David at Mahanaim <a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. With whom&#8212;Hebrew, "him." The antecedent is evidently to Manasseh, not, however, the half-tribe just mentioned, but the other half; for the historian, led, as it were, by the sound of the word, breaks off to describe the possessions beyond Jordan already assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half of Manasseh (see on [190]Nu 32:1; [191]Nu 32:33; also see De 3:8-17). It may be proper to remark that it was wise to put these boundaries on record. In case of any misunderstanding or dispute arising about the exact limits of each district or property, an appeal could always be made to this authoritative document, and a full knowledge as well as grateful sense obtained of what they had received from God (Ps 16:5, 6).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This is the inheritance of the children of Gad, after their families,....

Commencing at or about Heshbon on the south, it extended to the ancient sanctuary of Mahanaim on the north; on the east the furthest landmark was “Aroer that faces Rabbah;” while the Jordan formed the boundary on the west. The character of the tribe was throughout fierce and warlike (<a href="/genesis/49-19.htm" title="Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.">Genesis 49:19</a>), “strong men of might, men of war for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, their faces the faces of lions, and like roes upon the mountains for swiftness” (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm" title="The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and three score, that went out to the war.">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm" title="And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes on the mountains;">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). In the finest region south of the Jabbok Gad “dwelt as a lion” (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-20.htm" title="And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlarges Gad: he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm with the crown of the head.">Deuteronomy 33:20</a>), and that the civilisation attained by this tribe was of a higher order than “the mere fierceness necessary to repel the attacks of the plunderers of the desert” comes out in (<span class="ital">a</span>) the history of Jephthah (<a href="/judges/11-1.htm" title="Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.">Jdg 11:1</a>); of (<span class="ital">b</span>) the eleven valiant chiefs who crossed the fords of Jordan in flood-time to join David—“their faces like the faces of lions, as swift as the gazelles upon the mountains” (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/12-8.htm" title="And of the Gadites there separated themselves to David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes on the mountains;...">1 Chronicles 12:8-15</a>); in (<span class="ital">c</span>) the loyalty and generosity of Barzillai (<a href="/context/2_samuel/19-32.htm" title="Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man....">2 Samuel 19:32-39</a>); (<span class="ital">d</span>) the marvellous career of Elijah “the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead” (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the inheritance of the children of Gad.</span> The cause of the difference between the Reubenites and the Gadites may perhaps be thus explained. While both inhabited a similar tract of country, a country from its open and pastoral character likely to develop a hardy and healthy race of men, the Reubenites were exposed to the seductions of the Moabitish worship of Chemosh, which, when combined with an ancestral temperament by no means prone to resist such influences (see <a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), soon proved fatal to a tribe, itself not numerous (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>), and hemmed in on every side but the north by the unbelievers. The temperament inherited by the Gadites added to their more favourable situation and the nature of their pursuits, developed a hardy and warlike race ready to do battle, and fearless of their foes (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>). Of this tribe came the valiant Jephthah, and of it also came the brave soldiers of David, whose qualifications stir to poetry the sober chronicler of Judah (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). We may see here the influence of circumstances on the character of a people. Originally (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>) the Reubenites and the Gadites were alike. But the Reubenites, as we have seen, from unfavourable surroundings, lost the character which the Gadites, more favourably situated, were enabled to preserve. And the distinctions of tribes, producing as they did a separate <span class="accented">esprit de corps in</span> each tribe, will serve to explain why one tribe did not immediately succumb to influences which proved fatal to another. In the end, as we know, all the people of Gad fell victims to the temptations which surrounded them, and, save in the case of Levi, Judah, and Benjamin, and the few faithful Israelites who went over to them, irrevocably. The same phenomenon may be observed in the history of nations generally. As long as their manners were simple and their morals pure, they have preserved their liberty, and in many cases have acquired empire. As soon as their bodies were enervated by luxury, and their minds corrupted by vice, they fell a prey to foes whom formerly they would have despised. Thus fell the Greek and Boman republics, thus the Britons became an easy prey to the Saxons, and the Saxons to the Danes. In every instance the history of a tribe and of a nation serves to illustrate the maxim that "righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Kirjathaim, where Chedorlaomer defeated the Emim, is probably to be found in the ruins of et-Teym, half an hour to the west of Medaba (see at <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>). Sibmah (<a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>), according to Jerome (on <a href="/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>), only 500 paces from Heshbon, appears to have hopelessly disappeared. Zereth-hashachar, i.e., splendor aurorae, which is only mentioned here, was situated "upon a mountain of the valley." According to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>, the valley was the Jordan valley, or rather (according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>, <a href="/genesis/14-8.htm">Genesis 14:8</a>) the vale of Siddim, a valley running down on the eastern side of the Dead Sea. Seetzen conjectures that the town referred to is the present ruin of Sar, on the south of Zerka Maein. - Beth-peor, opposite to Jericho, six Roman miles higher than (to the east of) Libias: see at <a href="/numbers/23-28.htm">Numbers 23:28</a>. The "slopes of Pisgah" (<a href="/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>): to the south of the former, on the north-eastern shore of the Dead Sea (see at <a href="/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a>). Beth-jeshimoth (<a href="/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>), in the Ghor el Seisabn, on the north-east side of the Dead Sea (see at <a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-21.htm">Joshua 13:21</a>, the places which Reuben received in addition to those mentioned by name are all summed up in the words, "and all the (other) towns of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon," sc., so far as it extended over the plain. These limitations of the words are implied in the context: the first in the fact that towns in the plain are mentioned in <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>; the second in the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>, "the rest of the kingdom of Sihon," i.e., the northern portion of it, was given to the Gadites. The allusion to Sihon induced the author to mention his defeat again; see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, where the five Midianitish vassals who were slain with Sihon are noticed in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>, and the death of Balaam is also mentioned. "Dukes of Sihon," properly vassals of Sihon; &#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; does not signify anointed, however, but means literally poured out, i.e., cast, moulded, enfeoffed. The word points to the "creation of a prince by the communication or pouring in of power" (Gusset, s. v.). </body></html>
