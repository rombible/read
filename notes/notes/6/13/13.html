It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The writer appends to the command of God <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1-7</a> a statement that the other two tribes and a half had already had their inheritance marked out for them by Moses in the land east of Jordan. The boundaries of this territory as a whole are first set forth <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8-14</a>, and afterward the portions assigned within it to the two tribes and a half are severally described <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15-33</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. With whom&#8212;Hebrew, "him." The antecedent is evidently to Manasseh, not, however, the half-tribe just mentioned, but the other half; for the historian, led, as it were, by the sound of the word, breaks off to describe the possessions beyond Jordan already assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half of Manasseh (see on [190]Nu 32:1; [191]Nu 32:33; also see De 3:8-17). It may be proper to remark that it was wise to put these boundaries on record. In case of any misunderstanding or dispute arising about the exact limits of each district or property, an appeal could always be made to this authoritative document, and a full knowledge as well as grateful sense obtained of what they had received from God (Ps 16:5, 6).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This seems added by way of anticipation and reflection upon the present Israelites; implying, that although Moses did and might permit them to remain, both because the land which he had conquered was more than enough for the Israelitish possessors, and because being intent upon their passage over Jordan into the land of Canaan, he would not delay them, by searching their enemies out of all their corners; yet they were in fault, in not going on and perfecting the work which was begun by Moses, and carried on so far by Joshua. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Nevertheless, the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites,....

One of these was the Aramean Maachah, probably extending to the sources of the Jordan; and the other belonged to the aborigines, and was called Geshur. These two little kingdoms are generally mentioned together, and they existed till after David’s time.” Ewald, p. 302.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There still remained to be taken (2) "the land of the Giblites," i.e., the territory of the population of Gebal (<a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>), the Byblos of the classics, on the Mediterranean Sea, to the north of Beirut, called Jebail by the Arabs, and according to Edrisi (ed. Jaubert, i. p. 356), "a pretty town on the sea-shore, enclosed in good walls, and surrounded by vineyards and extensive grounds planted with fruit trees" (see also Abulfed. Tab. Syr. p. 94). It is still a town with an old wall, some portions of which apparently belong to the time of the Crusades (see Burckhardt, Syr. p. 296, and Ritter, Erdk. xvii. pp. 60ff.).<p>(Note: The evidence adduced by Movers (Phnizier, ii. 1, p. 103), that the Giblites did not belong to the Canaanites, has more plausibility than truth.)<p>"And all Lebanon toward the sunrising:" i.e., not Antilibanus (Knobel), but the Lebanon which is to the east of the territory of Gebal, "from Baal-gad under Mount Hermon," i.e., Paneas Banjas at the foot of Hermon (see at <a href="/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>), "unto the entering in to Hamath," i.e., as far up as the territory of the kingdom of Hamath, with the capital of the same name on the Orontes (see at <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>). Lastly, there still remained (3) "all the inhabitants of the mountains, from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim," i.e., the promontory of Nakura (see at <a href="/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>), namely "all the Sidonians," i.e., all the Phoenicians who dwelt from Lebanon southwards, from the boundary of the territory of Hamath down to the promontory of Nakura. According to ancient usage, the Sidonians stand for the Phoenicians generally, as in Homer, on account of Sidon being the oldest capital of Phoenicia (see Ges. on Isa. i. pp. 724ff.). All these the Lord would root out before Israel, and therefore Joshua was to divide the whole of northern Canaan, which was inhabited by Phoenicians, among the Israelites. "only divide thou it by lot for an inheritance," etc. &#1512;&#1511;, only, i.e., although thou hast not yet taken it. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, to cause it to fall, here used with reference to the lot, i.e., to divide by lot. "Fulfil thy duty in the distribution of the land, not even excepting what is still in the firm grasp of the enemy; for I will take care to perform what I have promised. From this we may learn to rely so perfectly upon the word of God, when undertaking any duty, as not to be deterred by doubts of fears" (Calvin).</body></html>
