It is the will of God that every man should know his own, and not take that which is another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right. Wherever our habitation is placed, and in whatever honest way our portion is assigned, we should consider them as allotted of God; we should be thankful for, and use them as such, while every prudent method should be used to prevent disputes about property, both at present and in future. Joshua must be herein a type of Christ, who has not only conquered the gates of hell for us, but has opened to us the gates of heaven, and having purchased the eternal inheritance for all believers, will put them in possession of it. Here is a general description of the country given to the two tribes and a half, by Moses. Israel must know their own, and keep to it; and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, encroach on their neighbours. Twice in this chapter it is noticed, that to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: see Nu 18:20. Their maintenance must be brought out of all the tribes. The ministers of the Lord should show themselves indifferent about worldly interests, and the people should take care they want nothing suitable. And happy are those who have the Lord God of Israel for their inheritance, though little of this world falls to their lot. His providences will supply their wants, his consolations will support their souls, till they gain heavenly joy and everlasting pleasures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dukes of Sihon - Rather "vassals of Sihon," probably those "dedicated" or "appointed" with a libation.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. With whom&#8212;Hebrew, "him." The antecedent is evidently to Manasseh, not, however, the half-tribe just mentioned, but the other half; for the historian, led, as it were, by the sound of the word, breaks off to describe the possessions beyond Jordan already assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half of Manasseh (see on [190]Nu 32:1; [191]Nu 32:33; also see De 3:8-17). It may be proper to remark that it was wise to put these boundaries on record. In case of any misunderstanding or dispute arising about the exact limits of each district or property, an appeal could always be made to this authoritative document, and a full knowledge as well as grateful sense obtained of what they had received from God (Ps 16:5, 6).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The soothsayer; </span> so he was in truth, though a <span class="ital">prophet</span> <span class="ital">{<span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_peter/2-16.htm" title="But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet.">2 Peter 2:16</a></span>}</span> in title and profession.

The tribe of Reuben received its inheritance in the south-namely, the territory from Aror in the Arnon valley, and from Ar in that valley, onwards, and the plain (table-land) by Medeba (see <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>), with Heshbon the capital and her towns, i.e., the towns dependent upon it, in the plain. Heshbon, almost in the centre between the Arnon and the Jabbok, was situated upon the border of the inheritance of the Reubenites, and was ceded to the Gadites, who gave it up to the Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-39.htm">Joshua 21:39</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-66.htm">1 Chronicles 6:66</a> : see at <a href="/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>).

Bamoth-baal, also called Bamoth simply (<a href="/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>), is to be sought for on the Jebel Attarus (see at <a href="/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a>). It was thence that Balaam saw the end of the Israelitish camp (<a href="/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>). Bethbaal-meon, the present ruin of Myun, three-quarters of an hour S.E. of Heshbon (see at <a href="/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>). Jahza, where Sihon was defeated, was to the east of Medeba, according to the Onom.; and Dibon was on the border of the desert (see at <a href="/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>). Kedemoth, on the border of the desert, to the north-west of Kalaat Balua, is to be sought on the northern bank of the Balua, or upper Arnon (see at <a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>). Mephaath, where there was a garrison stationed (according to the Onom.) as a defence against the inhabitants of the desert, is to be sought for in the neighbourhood of Jahza, with which it is always associated (<a href="/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a>). Kedemoth and Mephaath were given up to the Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-64.htm">1 Chronicles 6:64</a>). </body></html>
