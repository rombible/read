In <span class= "ital">New </span>Testament language, to tell Joshua is to “tell Jesus “—the only way in which confession of sin can bring glory. Joshua could only pronounce sentence of death on Achan. But “if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” The Hebrew word for “confession” also means “thanksgiving.” Acknowledgment of sin and mercy are not far apart, in making confession to God. (See <a href="/ezra/10-11.htm" title="Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.">Ezra 10:11</a> for a parallel to the phrase.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">My son — </span>So he calls him, to show that this severe inquisition and sentence did not proceed from any hatred to his person, which he loved as a father doth his son, and as a prince ought to do each of his subjects. <span class="ital">Give glory to the Lord God of Israel — </span>As thou hast highly dishonoured him, now take the blame to thyself, and ascribe unto God the glory of his omniscience in knowing thy sin; of his justice in punishing it in thee, and others for thy sake; of his omnipotence, which was obstructed by thee; and of his kindness and faithfulness to his people, which was eclipsed by thy wickedness; all which will now be evident by thy sin confessed and punished.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:16-26 See the folly of those that promise themselves secrecy in sin. The righteous God has many ways of bringing to light the hidden works of darkness. See also, how much it is our concern, when God is contending with us, to find out the cause that troubles us. We must pray with holy Job, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Achan's sin began in the eye. He saw these fine things, as Eve saw the forbidden fruit. See what comes of suffering the heart to walk after the eyes, and what need we have to make this covenant with our eyes, that if they wander they shall be sure to weep for it. It proceeded out of the heart. They that would be kept from sinful actions, must mortify and check in themselves sinful desires, particularly the desire of worldly wealth. Had Achan looked upon these things with an eye of faith, he would have seen they were accursed things, and would have dreaded them; but looking on them with an eye of sense only, he saw them as goodly things, and coveted them. When he had committed the sin, he tried to hide it. As soon as he had got this plunder, it became his burden, and he dared not to use his ill-gotten treasure. So differently do objects of temptation appear at a distance, to what they do when they have been gotten. See the deceitfulness of sin; that which is pleasing in the commission, is bitter in the reflection. See how they will be deceived that rob God. Sin is a very troublesome thing, not only to a sinner himself, but to all about him. The righteous God will certainly recompense tribulation to them that trouble his people. Achan perished not alone in his sin. They lose their own, who grasp at more than their own. His sons and daughters were put to death with him. It is probable that they helped to hide the things; they must have known of them. What fatal consequences follow, even in this world, to the sinner himself, and to all belonging him! One sinner destroys much good. What, then, will be the wrath to come? Let us flee from it to Christ Jesus as the sinner's Friend. There are circumstances in the confession of Achan, marking the progress of sin, from its first entrance into the heart to its being done, which may serve as the history of almost every offence against the law of God, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give glory to the Lord - A form of solemn adjuration by which the person addressed was called upon before God to declare the truth.

Joshua feels for the criminal, even though he is forced to put him to death. So in cur own day the spectacle is not uncommon of a judge melted to tears as he passes sentence of death on the murderer. The expression seems almost to imply a belief that, though Achan must undergo the extremest penalty of the law in this world, Joshua entertained a hope that he might be forgiven in the next. It certainly proves that, stern as the law of Moses was, it was felt, at least in those early days, to be rather against the sin than the sinner that its severity was directed. In commenting upon the severity of the Mosaic covenant, whether towards offenders against its provisions or against the Canaanites, we must remember Bishop Butler's caution, that in this world we see but a very small portion of the whole counsel of God. Give glory to the Lord Cod of Israel, and make confession unto Him. Literally, <span class="accented">offer</span> (or <span class="accented">impute</span>) <span class="accented">glory to the Lord God of Israel, </span> and <span class="accented">give</span> confession (or <span class="accented">praise</span>) unto Him (cf. <a href="/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24</a>). The meaning is to give honour to God as the all-seeing God, the revealer of secrets, by an open confession before men of what is already known to Him. It may have been a common formula of adjuration, though Masius thinks otherwise. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua was to take away this ban from the nation. To discover who had laid hands upon the ban, he was to direct the people to sanctify themselves for the following day (see at <a href="/joshua/3-5.htm">Joshua 3:5</a>), and then to cause them to come before God according to their tribes, families, households, and men, that the guilty men might be discovered by lot; and to burn whoever was found guilty, with all that he possessed. &#1504;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;, "to come near," sc., to Jehovah, i.e., to come before His sanctuary. The tribes, families, households, and men, formed the four classes into which the people were organized. As the tribes were divided into families, so these again were subdivided into houses, commonly called fathers' houses, and the fathers' houses again into men, i.e., fathers of families (see the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25-26</a>, and by Bibl. Archaeology, 140). Each of these was represented by its natural head, so that we must picture the affair as conducted in the following manner: in order to discover the tribe, the twelve tribe princes came before the Lord; and in order to discover the family, the heads of families of the tribe that had been taken, and so on to the end, each one in turn being subjected to the lot. For although it is not distinctly stated that the lot was resorted to in order to discover who was guilty, and that the discovery was actually made in this way, this is very evident from the expression &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1470;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (which the Lord taketh), as this was the technical term employed, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-42.htm">1 Samuel 14:42</a>, to denote the falling of the lot upon a person (see also <a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20</a>). Moreover, the lot was frequently resorted to in cases where a crime could not be brought home to a person by the testimony of eye-witnesses (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41-42</a>; <a href="/jonah/1-7.htm">Jonah 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a>), as it was firmly believed that the lot was directed by the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). In what manner the lot was cast we do not know. In all probability little tablets or potsherds were used, with the names written upon them, and these were drawn out of an urn. This may be inferred from a comparison of <a href="/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-6.htm">Joshua 18:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>, according to which the casting of the lot took place in such a manner that the lot came up (&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-9.htm">Leviticus 16:9</a>), or came out (&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, <a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1501; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1491;, the person taken in (with) the ban, i.e., taken by the lot as affected with the ban, was to be burned with fire, of course not alive, but after he had been stoned (<a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>). The burning of the body of a criminal was regarded as heightening the punishment of death (vid., <a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>). This punishment was to be inflicted upon him, in the first place, because he had broken the covenant of Jehovah; and in the second place, because he had wrought folly in Israel, that is to say, had offended grievously against the covenant God, and also against the covenant nation. "Wrought folly:" an expression used here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>, to denote such a crime as was irreconcilable with the honour of Israel as the people of God. </body></html>
