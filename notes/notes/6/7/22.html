The righteous God has many ways of bringing to light the hidden works of darkness. See also, how much it is our concern, when God is contending with us, to find out the cause that troubles us. We must pray with holy Job, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Achan's sin began in the eye. He saw these fine things, as Eve saw the forbidden fruit. See what comes of suffering the heart to walk after the eyes, and what need we have to make this covenant with our eyes, that if they wander they shall be sure to weep for it. It proceeded out of the heart. They that would be kept from sinful actions, must mortify and check in themselves sinful desires, particularly the desire of worldly wealth. Had Achan looked upon these things with an eye of faith, he would have seen they were accursed things, and would have dreaded them; but looking on them with an eye of sense only, he saw them as goodly things, and coveted them. When he had committed the sin, he tried to hide it. As soon as he had got this plunder, it became his burden, and he dared not to use his ill-gotten treasure. So differently do objects of temptation appear at a distance, to what they do when they have been gotten. See the deceitfulness of sin; that which is pleasing in the commission, is bitter in the reflection. See how they will be deceived that rob God. Sin is a very troublesome thing, not only to a sinner himself, but to all about him. The righteous God will certainly recompense tribulation to them that trouble his people. Achan perished not alone in his sin. They lose their own, who grasp at more than their own. His sons and daughters were put to death with him. It is probable that they helped to hide the things; they must have known of them. What fatal consequences follow, even in this world, to the sinner himself, and to all belonging him! One sinner destroys much good. What, then, will be the wrath to come? Let us flee from it to Christ Jesus as the sinner's Friend. There are circumstances in the confession of Achan, marking the progress of sin, from its first entrance into the heart to its being done, which may serve as the history of almost every offence against the law of God, and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A goodly Babylonian garment - literally, "a robe or cloak of Shinar," the plain in which Babylon was situated <a href="/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>. It was a long robe such as was worn by kings on state occasions <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>, and by prophets <a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>. The Assyrians were in early times famous for the manufacture of beautiful dyed and richly embroidered robes (compare <a href="/ezekiel/23-15.htm">Ezekiel 23:15</a>). That such a robe should be found in a Canaanite city is natural enough. The productions of the far East found their way through Palestine both southward toward Egypt and westward through Tyre to the countries bordering on the Mediterranean. (Compare <a href="/ezekiel/27-24.htm">Ezekiel 27:24</a> and the context.)<p>Wedge of gold - i. e. some implement or ornament of gold shaped like a wedge or tongue. The name lingula was given by the Romans to a spoon and to an oblong dagger made in shape of a tongue. The weight of this "wedge" was fifty shekels, i. e. about twenty-five ounces (see <a href="/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a> note). The silver was under the rest of the stolen property. The mantle would naturally be placed uppermost, and be used to cover up the others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23. Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent&#8212;from impatient eagerness not only to test the truth of the story, but to clear Israel from the imputation of guilt.

The plural mishpachoth is adopted in the lxx and Vulgate, and also to be met with in seven MSS; but this is a conjecture rather than the original reading Mishpachah is either used generally, or employed in a collective sense to denote all the families of Judah. There is no ground for altering &#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (man by man) into &#1500;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (house by house) in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-17.htm">Joshua 7:17</a>, according to some of the MSS; the expression "man by man" is used simply because it was the representative men who came for the lot to be cast, not only in the case of the fathers' houses, but in that of the families also. </body></html>
