Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth &#8230; before the ark &#8230; he and the elders&#8212;It is evident, from those tokens of humiliation and sorrow, that a solemn fast was observed on this occasion. The language of Joshua's prayer is thought by many to savor of human infirmity and to be wanting in that reverence and submission he owed to God. But, although apparently breathing a spirit of bold remonstrance and complaint, it was in reality the effusion of a deeply humbled and afflicted mind, expressing his belief that God could not, after having so miraculously brought His people over Jordan into the promised land, intend to destroy them, to expose them to the insults of their triumphant enemies, and bring reproach upon His own name for inconstancy or unkindness to His people, or inability to resist their enemies. Unable to understand the cause of the present calamity, he owned the hand of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Joshua rent his clothes, </span> in testimony of great sorrow, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm" title="And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.">Genesis 37:34</a> 44:13</span>, for the loss felt, the consequent mischief feared, and the sin which he suspected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fell to the earth upon his face, </span> in deep humiliation and fervent supplication. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Until the eventide; </span> continuing the whole day in fasting and prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Put dust upon their heads; </span> as was usual in case of grief and astonishment, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm" title="And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth on his head.">1 Samuel 4:12</a> <a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm" title="It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.">2 Samuel 1:2</a> 13:19 <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm" title="For word came to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.">Jonah 3:6</a> <a href="/micah/1-10.htm" title="Declare you it not at Gath, weep you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.">Micah 1:10</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joshua rent his clothes,....

The clothes were torn in front over the breast, yet for not more than a handbreadth.
