Times of danger and trouble should be times of reformation. We should look at home, into our own hearts, into our own houses, and make diligent search to find out if there be not some accursed thing there, which God sees and abhors; some secret lust, some unlawful gain, some undue withholding from God or from others. We cannot prosper, until the accursed thing be destroyed out of our hearts, and put out of our habitations and our families, and forsaken in our lives. When the sin of sinners finds them out, God is to be acknowledged. With a certain and unerring judgment, the righteous God does and will distinguish between the innocent and the guilty; so that though the righteous are of the same tribe, and family, and household with the wicked, yet they never shall be treated as the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also stolen, and dissembled also - The anger of God and the heinousness of Israel's sin are marked by the accumulation of clause upon clause.

The conditions of the covenant have been violated by the reservation of spoil from the doomed city; wickedness, emphatically called folly, has been committed in Israel (Ps 14:1), and dissimulation, with other aggravations of the crime, continues to be practised. The people are liable to destruction equally with the accursed nations of Canaan (De 7:26).

This town was situated near Bethaven, on the east of Bethel. Bethel was originally called Luz (see at <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), a place on the border of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>). It is frequently mentioned, was well known at a later time as the city in which Jeroboam established the worship of the calves, and was inhabited again even after the captivity (see v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 178, 179). It has been preserved, in all probability, in the very extensive ruins called Beitin (see Robinson, Pal. ii. pp. 126ff.), about four hours' journey on horseback to the north of Jerusalem, and on the east of the road which leads from Jerusalem to Sichem (Nablus).<p>(Note: The statement of the Onomasticon of Eusebius s. v. Aggai' agree with this: &#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bb; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;.

According to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12-13</a>, the northern boundary of the tribe of Benjamin, which ran up from Jericho to the mountains on the west, passed on to the desert of Bethaven, and so onwards to Luz (Bethel). If we compare with this the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, that the Philistines who came against Israel encamped at Michmash before (in front of) Bethaven, according to which Bethaven was on the east or north-east of Michmash (Mukhmas), the desert of Bethaven may very possibly have been nothing more than the table-land which lies between the Wady Mutyah on the north and the Wadys Fuwar and Suweinit (in Robinson's map), or Wady Tuwr (on Van de Velde's map), and stretches in a westerly direction from the rocky mountain Juruntel to Abu Sebah (Subbah). Bethaven would then lie to the south or south-east of Abu Sebah. In that case, however, Ai (Sept. Gai or Aggai, <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>) would neither be found in the inconsiderable ruins to the south of the village of Deir Diwan, as Robinson supposes (Pal. ii. pp. 312ff.), nor on the site of the present Tell el Hajar, i.e., stone hill, three-quarters of an hour to the S.E. of Beitin, on the southern side of the deep and precipitous Wady Mutyah, as Van de Velde imagines; but in the ruins of Medinet Chai or Gai, which Krafft<p>(Note: Topograph. v. Jerusalem, p. ix.)<p>and Strauss<p>(Note: Sinai u. Golgoth. pp. 326-7.)<p>discovered on the flat surface of a mountain that slopes off towards the east, about forty minutes on the eastern side of Geba (Jeba), where "there are considerable ruins surrounded by a circular wall, whilst the place is defended on the south by the valley of Farah, and on the north by the valley of Es Suweinit, with steep shelving walls of rock" (Strauss: vid., C. Ritter Erdk. xvi. pp. 526-7). On the advice of the men who were sent out to explore the land, and who described the population on their return as small ("they are but few"), Joshua did not send the whole of the fighting men against Ai, but only about 3000 men. As there were not more than 12,000 inhabitants (<a href="/joshua/8-25.htm">Joshua 8:25</a>), there could hardly have been 3000 fighting men, who might easily have been beaten by 3000 Israelitish warriors. But when the Israelites attacked the town they fled before its inhabitants, who slew about thirty-six men, and pursued them before the gate, i.e., outside the town, to the stone quarries, and smote them on the sloping ground. The Shebarim, from sheber, a breach or fracture, were probably stone quarries near the slope on the east of the town. Nothing more can be decided, as the country has not been thoroughly explored by travellers. On account of this repulse the people lost all their courage. "The hearts of the people melted" (see <a href="/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>): this expression is strengthened still further by the additional clause, "and became as water." </body></html>
