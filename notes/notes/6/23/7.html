It must always be remembered that, in proposing the extermination of the seven nations, Jehovah reserved to Himself the ordering of the details of the conquest and extermination. When the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them.” He did not propose to deliver them all to Israel at once, for reasons set forth in Judges 2, 3. Meantime, it was a trial of Israel’s faith and obedience to live among idolaters without making any peace with them, or lending any countenance to their idolatry.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/joshua/23-7.htm" title="That you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:">Joshua 23:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">That ye come not among those nations </span>— That ye avoid all familiar converse and contracts, but especially marriage, with them. <span class="ital">Neither mention the name of their gods — </span>To wit, unnecessarily and familiarly, lest the mention of them should lead to discourse about them, and so by degrees bring them to the approbation and worship of them. <span class="ital">Nor cause to swear by them — </span>Not to require or even admit a Gentile to swear by his god, as was usual, especially in leagues and contracts; for this would have been to suppose that these imaginary deities were conscious of men’s thoughts, and had power to punish those who were guilty of perjury.

Also, very cautiously to endeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it may never be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of the heathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are. Joshua exhorts them to be very constant.

So with "serve" and "bow down" (see <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, etc.). Here again we have Joshua quoting Deuteronomy as the book of the Law of Moses. According to the "Deuteronomist" theory, the quotation is an audacious fiction, manufactured by the person who was at that moment forging the book from which he pretended to quote. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Exhortation to the Tribes of Israel to Remain Faithful to their Calling. - <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1</a>, <a href="/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a>. The introduction to the discourse which follows is attached in its first part to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/22-3.htm">Joshua 22:3-4</a>, and thus also to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-44</a>, whilst in the second part it points back to <a href="/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a>. The Lord had given the people rest from all their enemies round about, after the land had been subdued and divided by lot (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-44</a>). Joshua was already an old man at the termination of the war (<a href="/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a>); but since then he had advanced still further in age, so that he may have noticed the signs of the near approach of death. He therefore called together the representatives of the people, either to Timnath-serah where he dwelt (<a href="/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a>), or to Shiloh to the tabernacle, the central sanctuary of the whole nation, as the most suitable place for his purpose. "All Israel" is still further defined by the apposition, "its elders, and its heads, and its judges, and its officers." This is not to be understood, however, as referring to four different classes of rulers; but the term elders is the general term used to denote all the representatives of the people, who were divided into heads, judges, and officers. And the heads, again, were those who stood at the head of the tribes, families, and fathers' houses, and out of whose number the most suitable persons were chosen as judges and officers (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>; see my Bibl. Arch. ii.  143). Joshua's address to the elders of all Israel consists of two parts, which run parallel to one another so far as the contents are concerned, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2-13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14-16</a>. In both parts Joshua commences with a reference to his age and his approaching death, in consequence of which he felt constrained to remind the people once more of all the great things that the Lord had done for them, and to warn them against falling away from their gracious covenant God. Just as Joshua, in this the last act of his life, was merely treading in the footsteps of Moses, who had concluded his life with the fullest exhortations to the people to be faithful to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>), so his address consists entirely of reminiscences from the Pentateuch, more especially from Deuteronomy as he had nothing fresh to announce to the people, but could only impress the old truth upon their minds once more. </body></html>
