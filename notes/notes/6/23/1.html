He put them in mind of the great things God had done for them in his days. He exhorted them to be very courageous. Keep with care, do with diligence, and regard with sincerity what is written. Also, very cautiously to endeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it may never be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of the heathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are. Joshua exhorts them to be very constant. There might be many things amiss among them, but they had not forsaken the Lord their God; the way to make people better, is to make the best of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This and the next chapter contain the last addresses of Joshua. These addresses were no doubt among the closing acts of Joshua's life, but were evidently given on different occasions, and are of different character and scope. In the former Joshua briefly reminds the princes of the recent benefits of God toward them and their people, declares that God had fulfilled all His promises, and exhorts to faithfulness on their side to God that so His mercies may not be withdrawn: in the latter he takes a wider range, rehearses the gracious dealings of God with the nation from its very origin, and upon these as his grounds, he claims for God their sincere and entire service. But he grants them the option of withdrawing from the covenant if they so choose; and when they elect still to abide by it, it is solemnly renewed by the free consent of the whole people. Joshua's reproofs and warnings are in sum and substance identical with those with which Moses closed his career (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31.htm">Deuteronomy 31</a>, etc.).

But this refers to a more advanced age still, when the patriarch felt his powers failing him, and desired, as far as his influence went, to preserve the Israelites in the path in which they had walked since their entrance into Canaan. Calvin has some good remarks on the "pious solicitude" shown by the aged warrior for those whom he had led in time of war and guided in time of peace. He seems to have sent for the chief men in Israel to his home at Timnath-Serah, where apparently he had led a retired and peaceful life, only coming forward to direct the affairs of the nation when necessity required. His address is simple and practical. He reminds them that they will soon lose the benefit of his experience and authority, and of the work that he had done, under God's direction, in settling them in the land. Then he proceeds to urge strict obedience to the law of God, reminding them that victory is assured to them, if they will but be true to themselves and their calling as the servants of God, but that as certainly as they neglect to do so, wrath and misery will be their portion. He emphasizes his words by reminding them how amply God had fulfilled his promise, and concludes with a picture of the evil which will befall them if they rebel against God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The speakers conclude with an expression of horror at the thought of rebelling against Jehovah. &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, "far be it from us away from Him (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;,   <a href="/1_samuel/24-7.htm">1 Samuel 24:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-11.htm">1 Samuel 26:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-3.htm">1 Kings 21:3</a>), to rebel against Jehovah," etc. </body></html>
