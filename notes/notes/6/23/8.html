He put them in mind of the great things God had done for them in his days. He exhorted them to be very courageous. Keep with care, do with diligence, and regard with sincerity what is written. Also, very cautiously to endeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it may never be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of the heathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are. Joshua exhorts them to be very constant. There might be many things amiss among them, but they had not forsaken the Lord their God; the way to make people better, is to make the best of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Israel, and for their elders - Omit "and," which is not in the Hebrew.

But the accomplishment of the divine promise depended on their inviolable fidelity to God's law&#8212;on their keeping resolutely aloof from all familiar intercourse and intimate connections with the Canaanites, or in any way partaking of their idolatrous sins. In the event of their continuing in steadfast adherence to the cause of God, as happily distinguished the nation at that time, His blessing would secure them a course of brilliant and easy victories (Le 26:7; De 28:7; 32:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Cleave unto the Lord, </span> by firm affiance, constant obedience, entire affection, faithful service and worship of him alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As ye have done unto this day, </span> to wit since you came into Canaan; since which time the body of the people for of them he speaks, not of every particular person) had behaved themselves much better than they did in the wilderness, and had not been guilty or any gross and general apostacy from God, or rebellion against him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But cleave unto the Lord your God,....
