Love the Lord your God, and you will not leave him. Has God been thus true to you? Be not you false to him. He is faithful that has promised, Heb 10:23. The experience of every Christian witnesses the same truth. Conflicts may have been severe and long, trials great and many; but at the last he will acknowledge that goodness and mercy followed him all the days of his life. Joshua states the fatal consequences of going back; know for a certainty it will be your ruin. The first step would be, friendship with idolaters; the next would be, marrying with them; the end of that would be, serving their gods. Thus the way of sin is down-hill, and those who have fellowship with sinners, cannot avoid having fellowship with sin. He describes the destruction he warns them of. The goodness of the heavenly Canaan, and the free and sure grant God has made of it, will add to the misery of those who shall for ever be shut out from it. Nothing will make them see how wretched they are, so much, as to see how happy they might have been. Let us watch and pray against temptation. Let us trust in God's faithfulness, love, and power; let us plead his promises, and cleave to his commandments, then we shall be happy in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Israel, and for their elders - Omit "and," which is not in the Hebrew.

The first hemistich points to the fulfilment of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-38.htm">Deuteronomy 4:38</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-23.htm">Deuteronomy 11:23</a>; the second to that of <a href="/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is placed at the beginning absolutely. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>, the blessing of fidelity to the law which Israel had hitherto experienced, is described, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>, upon the basis of the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7-8</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, and in <a href="/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a> the thought of <a href="/joshua/23-3.htm">Joshua 23:3</a> is repeated. To this there is attached, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm">Joshua 23:11-13</a>, the admonition to take heed for the sake of their souls (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>), to love the Lord their God (on the love of God as the sum of the fulfilment of the law, see <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>). For if they turned, i.e., gave up the faithfulness they had hitherto displayed towards Jehovah, and attached themselves to the remnant of these nations, made marriages with them, and entered into fellowship with them, which the Lord had expressly forbidden (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), let them know that the Lord their God would not cut off these nations before them any more, but that they would be a snare and destruction to them. This threat is founded upon such passages of the law as <a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>, and more especially <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. The figure of a trap, which is employed here (see <a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>), is still further strengthened by &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, a snare (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>). Shotet, a whip or scourge, an emphatic form of the word derived from the poel of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, only occurs here. "Scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes" (see <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>). Joshua crowds his figures together to depict the misery and oppression which would be sure to result from fellowship with the Canaanites, because, from his knowledge of the fickleness of the people, and the wickedness of the human heart in its natural state, he could foresee that the apostasy of the nation from the Lord, which Moses had foretold, would take place but too quickly; as it actually did, according to <a href="/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>., in the very next generation. The words "until ye perish," etc., resume the threat held out by Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a> (cf. Josh Deu 28:21.). </body></html>
