He put them in mind of the great things God had done for them in his days. He exhorted them to be very courageous. Keep with care, do with diligence, and regard with sincerity what is written. Also, very cautiously to endeavour that the heathen idolatry may be forgotten, so that it may never be revived. It is sad that among Christians the names of the heathen gods are so commonly used, and made so familiar as they are. Joshua exhorts them to be very constant. There might be many things amiss among them, but they had not forsaken the Lord their God; the way to make people better, is to make the best of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Israel, and for their elders - Omit "and," which is not in the Hebrew.

Dismissing all thoughts of his personal services, he ascribed the subjugation and occupation of Canaan entirely to the favoring presence and aid of God; and in doing so, he spoke not more piously than truly. This had been promised (De 1:30; 3:22); and the reality of the divine aid was seen in the rapid overthrow of the Canaanites, which had already led to the division of the whole land among the tribes [Jos 23:4].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">These nations that remain, </span> not yet conquered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">to be an inheritance for your tribes; </span> you shall certainly subdue them, and inherit their land, as you have done the rest, if you be not wanting to yourselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With all the nations that I have cut off, </span> i.e. with the land of those nations; the people put for their land, as we have seen before; and as sometimes, on the contrary, the <span class="ital">land</span> is put for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Westward, </span> where the Philistines, your most formidable adversaries, yet survive; but them also and their land I have given to you, and you shall undoubtedly destroy them, if you will proceed vigorously in your work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain,....

This, however, need not of necessity be imputed to them as a sin. For, as we have seen, the conquest was to be gradual. No doubt there was enough to be done in consolidating the conquests already made, in settling the tribes in their possessions, to occupy all the days of Joshua, and even possibly a longer period. At least we may he sure that, as long as Joshua lived, the heathen settlements were kept distinct from the Israelitish community, that intermarriages were not allowed, nor rights of citizenship granted to any but the Gibeonites. <span class="cmt_word">Cut off.</span> Joshua's speech here exactly agrees with the statements in <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28-41</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11, 14, 21</a>. Here at least, if Joshua's speech and the history were taken from two different sources, neither of them precisely accurate, the first postulate of the destructive criticism, we might have expected some slight discrepancy. But Joshua uses a word which implies total extermination, a feature, be it observed, of the campaigns of Moses and Joshua only, and not of the later Israelitish history. <span class="cmt_word">Westward</span>.
