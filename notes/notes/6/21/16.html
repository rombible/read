Thus in the Chronicles there are only forty-two towns mentioned by name instead of forty-eight, although it is stated in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-45.htm">1 Chronicles 6:45</a>. that 13 + 10 + 13 + 12, i.e., forty-eight towns in all, were given up to the Levites. The names omitted are (1) Jutta in Judah; (2) Gibeon in Benjamin; (3 and 4) Ethekeh and Gibbethon in Dan; (5 and 6) and Jokneam and Nahalal in Zebulun (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-23.htm">Joshua 21:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-35.htm">Joshua 21:35</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-59.htm">1 Chronicles 6:59-60</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-68.htm">1 Chronicles 6:68</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-77.htm">1 Chronicles 6:77</a>. In some cases also the author of the Chronicles gives different names, though some of them indeed are only different forms of the same name, e.g., Hilen for Holon, Alemeth for Almon, Ashtaroth for Beeshterah, Mashal for Misheal, Hammon for Hammoth-dor, Kirjathaim for Kartan (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-58.htm">1 Chronicles 6:58</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-60.htm">1 Chronicles 6:60</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-71.htm">1 Chronicles 6:71</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-74.htm">1 Chronicles 6:74</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-76.htm">1 Chronicles 6:76</a>, with <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-15.htm">Joshua 21:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-27.htm">Joshua 21:27</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-30.htm">Joshua 21:30</a>, <a href="/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>); or in some cases possibly different names of the same town, e.g., Jokmeam for Kibzaim, and Ramoth for Jarmuth, and Anem for En-gannim (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-68.htm">1 Chronicles 6:68</a>, 83, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-22.htm">Joshua 21:22</a>, <a href="/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29</a>); whilst some evidently give the true reading, viz., Ashan for Ain, and Bileam for Gath-rimmon (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-59.htm">1 Chronicles 6:59</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>, <a href="/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26</a>).
