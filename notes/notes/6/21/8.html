They build their claim upon a very good foundation; not their own merits or services, but the Divine precept. The maintenance of ministers is not a thing left merely to the will of the people, that they may let them starve if they please; they which preach the gospel should live by the gospel, and should live comfortably.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The non-priestly Kohathites had been diminished by the destruction of Korah and his company <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>.

The first lot was drawn by the Kohathites; and the first of theirs again by the priests, to whom thirteen cities were granted, and ten to the rest of the Kohathites (Jos 21:5); thirteen to the Gershonites (Jos 21:6), and twelve to the Merarites (Jos 21:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These cities with their suburbs; of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/numbers/35-2.htm" title="Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and you shall give also to the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.">Numbers 35:2</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs,.... Reaching two thousand cubits from the cities all around: these cities did not lie all together, and so could not be described by their coasts; but in the several tribes, and intermixed with their cities; which fulfilled Jacob's prophecy, that they should be divided and scattered in Israel, <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>; as well as it was so ordered for the benefit of the several tribes, that they might have the assistance of the priests and Levites, to instruct them in the knowledge of the laws and commandments of God, and all divine things: <p>as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses; <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the cities of refuge had been set apart, the towns were also selected, which the different tribes were to give up for the priest and Levites to dwell in according to the Mosaic instructions in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>, together with the necessary fields as pasturage for their cattle. The setting apart of the cities of refuge took place before the appointment of the Levitical towns, because the Lord had given commandment through Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6</a>, that they were to give to the Levites the six cities of refuge, and forty-two cities besides, i.e., forty-eight cities in all. From the introductory statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>, that the heads of the fathers (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>) of the Levitical families reminded the distribution committee at Shiloh of the command of God that had been issued through Moses, that towns were to be given them to dwell in, we cannot infer, as Calvin has done, that the Levites had been forgotten, till they came and asserted their claims. All that is stated in these words is, "that when the business had reached that point, they approached the dividers of the land in the common name of the members of their tribe, to receive by lot the cities appointed for them. They simply expressed the commands of God, and said in so many words, that they had been deputed by the Levites generally to draw lots for those forty-eight cities with their suburbs, which had been appointed for that tribe" (Masius). The clause appended to Shiloh, "in the land of Canaan," points to the instructions in <a href="/numbers/34-29.htm">Numbers 34:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-10.htm">Numbers 35:10</a>, to give the children of Israel their inheritance in the land of Canaan. </body></html>
