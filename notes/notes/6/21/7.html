They build their claim upon a very good foundation; not their own merits or services, but the Divine precept. The maintenance of ministers is not a thing left merely to the will of the people, that they may let them starve if they please; they which preach the gospel should live by the gospel, and should live comfortably.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The non-priestly Kohathites had been diminished by the destruction of Korah and his company <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>.

The setting apart of the cities of refuge took place before the appointment of the Levitical towns, because the Lord had given commandment through Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6</a>, that they were to give to the Levites the six cities of refuge, and forty-two cities besides, i.e., forty-eight cities in all. From the introductory statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>, that the heads of the fathers (see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>) of the Levitical families reminded the distribution committee at Shiloh of the command of God that had been issued through Moses, that towns were to be given them to dwell in, we cannot infer, as Calvin has done, that the Levites had been forgotten, till they came and asserted their claims. All that is stated in these words is, "that when the business had reached that point, they approached the dividers of the land in the common name of the members of their tribe, to receive by lot the cities appointed for them. They simply expressed the commands of God, and said in so many words, that they had been deputed by the Levites generally to draw lots for those forty-eight cities with their suburbs, which had been appointed for that tribe" (Masius). The clause appended to Shiloh, "in the land of Canaan," points to the instructions in <a href="/numbers/34-29.htm">Numbers 34:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-10.htm">Numbers 35:10</a>, to give the children of Israel their inheritance in the land of Canaan. </body></html>
