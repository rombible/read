In the first cited of these passages it has given rise to much discussion among those whose studies have been confined to the text of the English Bible, excluding even the margin. But its meaning is much debated among scholars. There seems no authority whatever for the translation <span class="accented">armed</span> or <span class="accented">harnessed.</span> We must either take it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to mean <span class="accented">in five divisions</span>, the usual manner of marching under Moses (see <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.), "divided into centre, right and left wings, van and rear guard" (Ewald); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">fierce, eager, brave</span>, from a Semitic root found also in the Arabic. So Rosenmuller and Gesenius - who does not, however, as Keil asserts, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to be fat, but from a root akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span> violence, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> to be pungent. The former refers to the parallel passage in <a href="/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a>, where for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> we find <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> <span class="accented">quick.</span> The first interpretation is rendered probable by <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, where the order of march is described as a fivefold order, and by the similarity of the word to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> five, and is not excluded by <a href="/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>, where the army, though disorganised, may have still been arranged in its fivefold divisions. The fact that there is an Arabic word, almost precisely similar, which is applied to the fivefold division of an army, makes it almost certain that this is the true meaning. But some scholars prefer to render it "brave," or "eager for war" (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> <a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>). This last word is also found in the parallel passages in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. and <a href="/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>. Its original meaning is <span class="accented">expeditus -</span> unencumbered. See note on the last-mentioned passage. All the mighty men of valour. The number of fighting men in these tribes would be, from a comparison of <a href="/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7, 18, 34</a>, remembering that <span class="accented">half</span> only of the tribe of Manasseh must be counted, between 110,000 and 111,000. But we read in <a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a> that 40,000 only of them went over. Above 70,000 must have remained behind to guard their women, children,and flocks, a precaution both reasonable and necessary. So indispensable, in fact, was it, that in this apparent discrepancy we may find one of the strongest proofs of the genuineness of our narrative. For, as Calvin remarks, in a country not yet pacified, all the women and children would infallibly have been massacred had they been left unprotected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:16-18. THE PEOPLE'S ANSWER. - <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The promise is followed by the condition upon which the Lord would fulfil His word. Joshua was to be firm and strong, i.e., well-assured, courageous, not alarmed (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>). In the first place (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>), he was to rely firmly upon the Lord and His promise, as Moses and the Lord had already told him (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>), and as is again repeated here, whilst at the same time the expression, "thou shalt divide for an inheritance," recalls to mind <a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-28.htm">Deuteronomy 3:28</a>; and in the second place (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>), he was to strive to attain and preserve this firmness by a careful observance of the law. "Observe to do," etc., as Moses had already impressed upon the hearts of all the people (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-27.htm">Deuteronomy 2:27</a>). The suffix in &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is to be explained on the supposition that the speaker had the book of the law in his mind. The further expansion, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>, is not only attached to the exhortations, with which Moses urges upon all the people in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18-19</a>, an uninterrupted study and laying to heart of the commandments of God, but even more closely to the directions to the king, to read every day in the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a>). "Not to depart out of the mouth," is to be constantly in the mouth. The law is in our mouth, not only when we are incessantly preaching it, but when we are reading it intelligently for ourselves, or conversing about it with others. To this there was to be added meditation, or reflection upon it both day and night (vid., <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>). &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; does not mean theoretical speculation about the law, such as the Pharisees indulged in, but a practical study of the law, for the purpose of observing it in thought and action, or carrying it out with the heart, the mouth, and the hand. Such a mode of employing it would be sure to be followed by blessings. "Then shalt thou make they way prosperous," i.e., succeed in all thine undertakings (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>), "and act wisely" (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-8.htm">Deuteronomy 29:8</a>). </body></html>
