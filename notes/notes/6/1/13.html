Those who condemn the two and a half tribes (or the persons whom they suppose to be spiritually represented by them) for not going far enough, should notice that on both sides of Jordan equally there was the “rest of God.” But this “rest” is only the first stage of several in Israel’s history. We find it again in the reign of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;">2Samuel 7:1</a>), Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.">1Chronicles 22:9</a>), Esther (<a href="/context/joshua/9-16.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelled among them.">Joshua 9:16-18</a>; <a href="/joshua/9-22.htm" title="And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when you dwell among us?">Joshua 9:22</a>), and we must not forget the comment in Hebrews 4, obtained from Psalms 95 : “For if Joshua had given them rest, then would He not afterward have spoken of another day.” “These all received not the promise.” <span class= "ital">“There remaineth </span>therefore <span class= "ital">a rest </span>to the people of God.” The last rest is Sabbatical; the rests that precede it are halting-places on the way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/joshua/1-13.htm" title="Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God has given you rest, and has given you this land....">Joshua 1:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Which Moses commanded you — </span>His charge to you, and your promise to him. <span class="ital">Rest </span>— That is, a place of rest, as that word signifies. <span class="ital">Before your brethren — </span>In the front of all of them; which was but reasonable; because they had the advantage of their brethren, having actually received their portion, which their brethren had only in hope; because they were freed from those impediments which the rest were exposed to, their wives, and children, and estates being safely lodged; and to prevent their withdrawing themselves from the present service, which they otherwise would have had temptations to do, because of the nearness of their habitations. <span class="ital">Armed — </span>For by this time they were well furnished with arms, which they had either from the Egyptians, Amalekites, or Amorites, from whom they had taken them; or, by purchase, from those people by whose borders they passed. <span class="ital">Men of valour — </span>All such were obliged to go over, if occasion required it, but Joshua took only some of them, because they were sufficient for his purpose, and because it was proper some should be left, both to secure their own wives, children, and possessions, and to prevent their enemies on that side from giving them disturbance while engaged in their enterprise upon Canaan.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-15 Joshua says to the people, Ye shall pass over Jordan, and shall possess the land; because God had said so to him. We honour the truth of God, when we stagger not at the promise of God. The two tribes and a half were to go over Jordan with their brethren. When God, by his providence, has given us rest, we ought to consider what service we may do to our brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Prepare you victuals - The order was probably given with the knowledge that the manna would cease when the host crossed the Jordan <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>, and possibly because amidst their preparations there might not be opportunity to gather it in sufficient quantity. Nor does it appear that manna ever formed the whole and sole sustenance of the people. (Compare <a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a> note.)<p>It is the view of the majority of commentators - Jewish and Christian, ancient and modern - that the "three days" here named are identical with those of <a href="/joshua/3-2.htm">Joshua 3:2</a>; and that the command of Joshua in the text was not in fact given until after the return of the spies. Here, as elsewhere in the Hebrew historical books and frequently in the Gospels, the order of time is superseded by the order of thought. For the purpose if the writer was not historical merely; it was, on the contrary, mainly religious and theoretical. Intending, then, to exhibit God as accomplishing His promises to the covenant-people, he begins by informing us that God gave the word and set Joshua and the host actually in motion to take possession of their inheritance. Having placed this leading fact in the forefront, he returns to mention in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a> certain transactions closely relevant to the early stages of Joshua's conquests, but which had in fact happened before the camp was removed from the plains of Moab and immediately after the expiration of the thirty days' mourning for Moses. <a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>. The order of events was probably the following - 3rd Nisan, the spies are sent out <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>; 6th, the spies return <a href="/joshua/2-23.htm">Joshua 2:23</a>; 7th, the camp is removed from Shittim to the bank of Jordan <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>, and the command <a href="/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a> is issued; 10th, the river is crossed <a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals&#8212;not manna, which, though it still fell, would not keep; but corn, sheep, and articles of food procurable in the conquered countries.<p>for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan&#8212;that is, the third day, according to Hebrew idiom&#8212;the time allotted for getting ready before the encampment in Abel-Shittim broke up and they removed to the desert bank of the river where no victuals were available. At the same time Joshua himself convened the two and a half tribes which had settled east of Jordan, to remind them of their promise (Nu 32:1-42) to assist their brethren in the conquest of western Canaan. Their readiness to redeem their pledge and the terms in which they answered the appeal of Joshua displayed to great advantage their patriotic and pious feelings at so interesting a crisis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Remember</span> his charge to you, and your promise to him, which they were obliged to keep; and Joshua was to see that they did so. <span class="ital">Rest</span> i.e. a place of rest, as that word signifies: <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/genesis/49-15.htm" title="And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.">Genesis 49:15</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you,....

Joshua was to be firm and strong, i.e., well-assured, courageous, not alarmed (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>). In the first place (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>), he was to rely firmly upon the Lord and His promise, as Moses and the Lord had already told him (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>), and as is again repeated here, whilst at the same time the expression, "thou shalt divide for an inheritance," recalls to mind <a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-28.htm">Deuteronomy 3:28</a>; and in the second place (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>), he was to strive to attain and preserve this firmness by a careful observance of the law. "Observe to do," etc., as Moses had already impressed upon the hearts of all the people (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-27.htm">Deuteronomy 2:27</a>). The suffix in &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is to be explained on the supposition that the speaker had the book of the law in his mind. The further expansion, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>, is not only attached to the exhortations, with which Moses urges upon all the people in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18-19</a>, an uninterrupted study and laying to heart of the commandments of God, but even more closely to the directions to the king, to read every day in the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a>). "Not to depart out of the mouth," is to be constantly in the mouth. The law is in our mouth, not only when we are incessantly preaching it, but when we are reading it intelligently for ourselves, or conversing about it with others. To this there was to be added meditation, or reflection upon it both day and night (vid., <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>). &#1492;&#1490;&#1492; does not mean theoretical speculation about the law, such as the Pharisees indulged in, but a practical study of the law, for the purpose of observing it in thought and action, or carrying it out with the heart, the mouth, and the hand. Such a mode of employing it would be sure to be followed by blessings. "Then shalt thou make they way prosperous," i.e., succeed in all thine undertakings (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>), "and act wisely" (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-8.htm">Deuteronomy 29:8</a>). </body></html>
