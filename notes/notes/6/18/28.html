The smallness of the district, hardly larger than the county of Middlesex, was compensated for by the excellence of the land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) The general level of this part of Palestine is very high, being 2000 feet above the level of the Mediterranean on the western side, and 3000 feet above the deep valley of the Jordan on the eastern side. This plateau is surmounted by a large number of eminences (Gibeon, Gibeah, Geba, all = “<span class="ital">hill</span>;” Ramah = “<span class="ital">eminence</span>;” Mizpeh = “<span class="ital">a watch-tower</span>”), which presented favourable sites for strong fortresses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) No less important than these eminences are the torrent-beds and ravines by which the upper country looks down into the deep tracts on each side of it, forming then, as they do now, the only mode of access from either the plains of Philistia and of Sharon on the west, or the <span class="ital">Ghôr</span> of the Jordan on the east.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) In the broken and hilly country, “little Benjamin” (<a href="/psalms/68-27.htm" title="There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.">Psalm 68:27</a>), famous above the rest for skill in archery (<a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm" title="From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.">2 Samuel 1:22</a>), for its slingers (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm" title="Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left handed; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.">Jdg 20:16</a>) and left-handed warriors (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Jdg 3:15</a>), became warlike and indomitable. “In his mountain passes—the ancient haunt of beasts of prey, he ‘ravined as a wolf in the morning,’ descended into the rich plains of Philistia on the one side, and of the Jordan on the other, and ‘returned in the evening to divide the spoil’ (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm" title="Benjamin shall shred as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.">Genesis 49:27</a>). In the troubled period of the Judges, the tribe of Benjamin maintained a struggle, unaided and for some time with success, against the whole of the rest of the nation (Judges 20, 21.).

Almost certainly the same as "Gibeah of Saul" (<a href="/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>). It was Saul's home (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2, 15, 16</a>). It was near Saul's home, at the time his temporary refuge, that the Philistines encamped when Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>.) made his daring attack on them. It was the scene of the terrible outrage recorded in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. Lieut. Conder has identified it with Jeba, not far from Miehmash, situated on one of the branches of the precipitous Wady Suwaynit. The situation explains the otherwise unintelligible narrative in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin.</span> Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 4.) reminds us how the very names suggest the "remarkable heights" which constitute the "table land" of which the inheritance of Benjamin consists. Thus Gibeon, Gibeah, Geba, or Gaba, all signify <span class="accented">hill.</span> Ramah signifies high place, and Mizpeh, watch tower, which of necessity must be situated on an eminence. Only by narrow passes along deep torrent beds could access be obtained to this mountainous region. Thus it was that the otherwise inexplicable resistance to all Israel in arms, recorded in <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20, 21</a>, was maintained. In a country like this the skill of the Benjamites with the sling (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>) and the bow (<a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>) could be used with terrible effect upon foes powerless to come to a hand-to-hand conflict. To Dean Stanley's vivid description of the physical geography of the country the student is referred for a detailed account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Beth-arabah: see at <a href="/joshua/15-6.htm">Joshua 15:6</a>.
