The exhortation needs repeating to every generation, and not less to our own than any other, since the prevalence of an external decency and propriety blinds our eyes to the impiety and evil which still lurks amid us unsubdued. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua therefore sent them back with their petition, and said, "If thou art a strong people, go up into the wood and cut it away," i.e., make room for houses, fields, and meadows, by clearing the forests, "in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim, if the mountain of Ephraim is too narrow for thee." The name "mountain of Ephraim" is used here in a certain sense proleptically, to signify the mountain which received its name from the tribe of Ephraim, to which it had only just been allotted. This mountain, which is also called the mountain of Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a>, <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>), was a limestone range running from Kirjath-jearim, where the mountains of Judah terminate (see at <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>), to the plain of Jezreel, and therefore embracing the greater part of the tribe-territory of Benjamin. The wood, which is distinguished from the mountain of Ephraim, and is also described in <a href="/joshua/17-18.htm">Joshua 17:18</a> as a mountainous land, is either the mountainous region extending to the north of Yasir as far as the mountains at Gilboa, and lying to the west of Beisan, a region which has not yet been thoroughly explored, or else, as Knobel supposes, "the broad range of woody heights or low woody hills, by which the mountains of Samaria are connected with Carmel on the north-west (Rob. iii. p. 189), between Taanath and Megiddo on the east, and Caesarea and Dor on the west." Possibly both may be intended, as the children of Joseph were afraid of the Canaanites in Beisan and in the plain of Jezreel (<a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>). The Rephaim were dwelling there, a tribe of gigantic stature (see at <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>), also the Perizzites (see at <a href="/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>).</body></html>
