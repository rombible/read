God, by his grace, has given us a title to a good land, the heavenly Canaan, but we are slack to take possession of it; we enter not into that rest, as we might by faith, and hope, and holy joy. How long shall it be thus with us? How long shall we thus stand in our own light, and forsake our own mercies for lying vanities? Joshua stirs the Israelites up to take possession of their lots.

For this purpose a commission was given to twenty-one persons&#8212;three chosen from each of the seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance, to make an accurate survey of the country.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Three men; </span> three, not one, for more exact observation both of the measure and quality of the several portions, and for greater assurance and evidence of their care and faithfulness in giving in their account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of each tribe; </span> either one of each of these tribes, who were yet unprovided for; or rather, two of all the tribes, even of them who had already received their portions; which was highly expedient, that in case it should appear that there was not a sufficiency for each of these tribes who wanted their portions, their brethren might be more ready either to assist them in procuring more land, or to part with some of their own portion to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Go through the land; </span> which they might now safely do, because the terror of the late war was yet upon the Canaanites, who were loth to rouse so near and potent an enemy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Give out from among you three men for each tribe,.... That is, for each of the seven tribes, in all twenty one; though some think they were to be taken out of all the nine tribes and a half, and were thirty six; and so Josephus (a) seems to understand it; but then he makes but one out of each tribe to be sent, and but ten in all, which is a great oversight in that historian: <p>and I will send them; Joshua would not take upon him to name the persons, but left it to their own choice for their greater satisfaction; but when chosen and presented to him, he would give them a commission and directions what to do: <p>and they shall rise; gird themselves, and prepare for their journey, and set out: <p>and go through the land; of Canaan; not the whole of it, but that part which as yet was not disposed of; though some think they were to go through and describe the whole land; but I see no reason for that, for what was described was to be divided into seven parts only, and what belonged already to Judah and Joseph, seem plainly to be excepted in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/18-5.htm">Joshua 18:5</a>, <p>and describe it according to the inheritance of them; take the dimensions of it, and divide it into seven parts, according to the number of the tribes that had not received their inheritance. Jarchi thinks this description and division were not to be made equally, but according to the largeness and smallness of the tribes; but this could not be done by the measurers, since the inheritance of each depended on the lot that was afterward to be cast, which by this means would have been rendered needless: <p>and they shall come again to me; which seems to be not only a precept or instruction to them, that when they had done their business, they should come to Joshua and give him an account of it; but an assurance also of their safety, that they should receive no disturbance nor hurt from the remaining Canaanites, but should return safe and well. <p>(a) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 1. sect. 21. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Give out from among you three men for <i>each</i> tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> the inheritance of them; and they shall come <i>again</i> to me.</span><p>(c) That is, into seven portions, one to every tribe.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Give out from among you</span>] If the territory was to be distributed, it was necessary that the more distant portions of the country should be surveyed. Joshua therefore directs the tribes to appoint a commission of twenty-one members, three from each tribe, who should undertake the duty and report to him at Shiloh. Their duty apparently was not so much to carry out an actual measurement of the country, as the preparation of a list of the cities (see <span class="ital"><a href="/joshua/18-9.htm" title="And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.">Joshua 18:9</a></span>), and the procuring information respecting the peculiar characteristics of different districts, such as, “what lands were barren and what fertile, whether a district was hilly or flat, whether well-watered or destitute of springs, and anything else which served to shew the goodness of the soil, and the comparative worth of different localities.” Rosenmüller.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give out from among you.</span> Calvin enlarges much upon the boldness of these twenty-one men in venturing upon the task of the survey, rightly supposing that the difficulty of the task was enhanced by the number who undertook it (see note on Joshua 14:12). And here it is impossible to come to any other conclusion than that the twenty-one commissioners went together, for the object of their selection was to obviate complaints of a kind which, as we have already seen, the Israelites were not slow to make (see <a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>). But the Israelites had inspired quite sufficient awe into the inhabitants of the land to make such a general survey by no means a difficult task. Nor is it probable that the commissioners were unprovided with an escort. <span class="cmt_word">Three men for each tribe.</span> Literally, for <span class="accented">the</span> tribe. This selection, which was intended to secure an impartial description of the country, would render impossible all future complaints, since the boundaries would be settled according to reports sent in by the representatives of each tribe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The children of Joseph replied that the mountain (allotted to them) would not be enough for them (&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, as in <a href="/numbers/11-22.htm">Numbers 11:22</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a>); and that all the Canaanites who dwelt in the land of the plain had iron chariots, both those in Beth-shean and its daughter towns, and those in the valley of Jezreel. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;&#1470;&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;, the land of the plain or valley land, includes both the valley of the Jordan near Beisan, and also the plain of Jezreel, which opens into the Jordan valley in the neighbourhood of Beisan (Rob. iii. p. 173). The plain of Jezreel, so called after the town of that name, is called the "great field of Esdrelom" in Judith 1:4, and &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; by Josephus. It is the present Merj (i.e., pasture-land) Ibn Aamer, which runs in a south-westerly direction from the Mediterranean Sea above Carmel, and reaches almost to the Jordan. It is bounded on the south by the mountains of Carmel, the mountain-land of Ephraim and the range of hills connecting the two, on the north by the mountains of Galilee, on the west by the southern spurs of the Galilean highland, and on the east by the mountains of Gilboa and the Little Hermon (Jebel Duhy). Within these boundaries it is eight hours in length from east to west, and five hours broad; it is fertile throughout, though very desolate now (see v. Raumer, Pal. iii. pp. 39ff.). "Iron chariots" are not scythe chariots, for these were introduced by Cyrus, and were unknown to the Medes, Persians, and Arabians, i.e., to the early Asiatics before his time (Xen. Cyr. vi. 1, 27, 30), as well as to the ancient Egyptians (see Wilkinson, Manners and Customs, i. p. 350); they were simply chariots tipped with iron, just as the Egyptian war-chariots were made of wood and strengthened with metal nails and tips (Wilkinson, pp. 342, 348).</body></html>
