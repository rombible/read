In the story of Joseph, the brethren are reconciled through the mutual affection of Judah and Joseph for Benjamin as their father’s youngest and best-loved son.<p>The position thus given to Benjamin under Joshua was still further developed by circumstances. The tribe was almost exterminated in the time of the judges; the survivors were united in marriage with women of Ephraim and Manasseh (?). On the other hand, the city of Jerusalem, although assigned by Joshua to Benjamin, was first a joint possession of Judah and Benjamin (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-28.htm" title="These were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief men. These dwelled in Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 8:28</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-32.htm" title="And Mikloth begat Shimeah.

The selection of the first king of Israel from Benjamin, and the ultimate planting of the religious and political centre of all the tribes on the confines of Judah and Benjamin in Jerusalem, would have been two masterstrokes of policy if they had been schemes of man’s devising. They were really links in the long chain of God’s providential dealing with the chosen people.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">And their border.</span>—This is first described on the north side, where it coincided with the southern border of Ephraim.

In the division of the kingdoms, though the tribe of Benjamin followed the house of Judah, the town of Bethel was regarded as part of the kingdom of Israel, and Jeroboam’s southern boundary. He set up two golden calves, one in Bethel and the other in Dan, at the northern and southern extremities of his kingdom.<p>(25) <span class= "ital">El-Jêb, Er-Râm, Bireh </span>(all in sheet 17).<p>(26) S<span class= "ital">h’afât, Kejîreh, Beit Mizzeh </span>(Kefireh, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Kefriyeh, sheet 14); the others are in sheet 17<p>(27) <span class= "ital">Râfât </span>(sheet 17).<p>(28) <span class= "ital">Lifta, El-Kuds, Jebî’a, Kuriet-el-’ anab </span>(all in sheet 17).<p>(28) <span class= "bld">Jebusi, which is Jerusalem.</span>—When “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killed the prophets, and stoned them that were sent unto her,” was called to account for “all the righteous blood shed upon the earth,” <span class= "ital">the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack, </span>having been put there, as we see, by Joshua, the steward (after Moses) of the true Joseph’s house. (See <span class= "ital">Names on the Gates of Pearl—</span>Benjamin, p. 191.) Jerusalem is always thought of as the capital of Judah. Probably few readers of the Bible would answer, if asked for its position, that it was originally a Benjamite city. And we may add that no later writer than Joshua would be likely to have placed it in the territory of Benjamin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/joshua/18-11.htm" title="And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.">Joshua 18:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">The lot of Benjamin came up — </span>No doubt it was by peculiar direction of Providence that the children of Benjamin should have the first lot of these seven, next to the children of Joseph, they two being the only sons of Rachel, the beloved wife of Jacob.

And it is observable, that, in that blessing of Moses, Benjamin is placed between Judah and Joseph, Levi having no inheritance among them. But Providence placed Benjamin here, not only that he might be next to Joseph, his own and only brother, on the one hand; but that, being next to Judah on the other, this tribe might hereafter unite with Judah, in an adherence to the throne of David, and the temple of Jerusalem.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:11-28 The boundaries of each portion were distinctly drawn, and the inheritance of each tribe settled.

Is the lot of any servant of Christ cast in affliction and sorrow? It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Are we in prosperity and peace? It is from above.
