He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>En-gannim - i. e.

Tabor was the name of a mountain in those parts; it is generally supposed to be the mountain on which our Lord was transfigured, though it is not sufficiently evident; See Gill on <a href="/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>. There was a city of this name near it, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-77.htm">1 Chronicles 6:77</a>, and which is meant here, and which either gave unto or received name from the mount. The Greeks call it Itabyrium, and it is described by Polybius (g) as situated on a hill rising in the form of a pap or breast, and has an ascent of more than fifteen furlongs, and he calls it a city: <p>and Shahazimah is not mentioned any where else: <p>and Bethshemesh; there seem to have been several cities, at least more than one, of the name of Bethshemesh; one in the tribe of Judah, <a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>; and another in the tribe of Naphtali, <a href="/joshua/19-38.htm">Joshua 19:38</a>; which perhaps may be the same with this, it lying on the borders of both tribes. In this, and so in others of the same name, was a temple dedicated to the sun by the Heathens, as there was one of the same name in Egypt for the same reason, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-13.htm">Jeremiah 43:13</a>, <p>and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan; here it ended: so Josephus says, that the border of this tribe in the length of it were Mount Carmel (at one end), and the river (i.e. Jordan, at the other); and at the breadth of it the mountain Itabyrium, or Mount Tabor: it had Jordan on the east, the sea on the west, Zebulun on the north, and Manasseh on the south: <p>sixteen cities with their villages; which was the sum total of them. <p>(g) Hist. l. 5. p. 413. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">and the coast reacheth to Tabor</span>] Not the mountain, but a town upon the mountain, given to the Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-77.htm" title="To the rest of the children of Merari were given out of the tribe of Zebulun, Rimmon with her suburbs, Tabor with her suburbs:">1 Chronicles 6:77</a>), and to <span class="ital">Shahazimah</span> and <span class="ital">Beth-shemesh</span>. The site of neither of these places is known, for the Beth-shemesh here mentioned is not the town of that name in the tribe of Judah (ch. <a href="/joshua/15-10.htm" title="And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:">Joshua 15:10</a>)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the outgoings of their border</span>] The Jordan formed the eastern boundary of the tribe, but how far its territory extended down into the Jordan Valley is not stated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sixteen cities</span>] Which number is correct, if Tabor is taken as a city. Being a border town, it is not remarkable that here it is reckoned to Issachar, and in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-77.htm" title="To the rest of the children of Merari were given out of the tribe of Zebulun, Rimmon with her suburbs, Tabor with her suburbs:">1 Chronicles 6:77</a> to Zebulun.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The coast reacheth.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">the border skirteth</span>, as in ver. 11. <span class="cmt_word">Tabor</span>. Perhaps the same as Chisloth-Tabor in ver. 12 (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/6-77.htm">1 Chronicles 6:77</a>). It would therefore be, as Mount Tabor certainly was, on the boundary between the tribes of Issachar and Zebulun. <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shemesh.</span> Not the well known town in the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>). The repetition of this name is a proof of the extent to which sun worship prevailed in Palestine before the Israelite invasion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The towns of Zebulun were the following. Kattath, probably the same as Kitron, which is mentioned in <a href="/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a> in connection with Nahalol, but which is still unknown. Nehalal, or Nahalol (<a href="/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>), is supposed by V. de Velde (Mem. p. 335), who follows Rabbi Schwartz, to be the present village of Maalul, a place with ruins on the south-west of Nazareth (see Seetzen, ii. p. 143; Rob. iii. App.; and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 700). Simron is supposed by Knobel to be the village of Semunieh (see at <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>). But neither of these is very probable. Idalah is supposed by V. de Velde to be the village of Jeda or Jeida, on the west of Semunieh, where are a few relics of antiquity, though Robinson (Bibl. Res. p. 113) states the very opposite. Bethlehem (of Zebulun), which many regard as the home of the judge Ibzan (<a href="/judges/12-8.htm">Judges 12:8</a>), has been preserved under the old name in a miserable village on the north of Jeida and Semunieh (see Seetzen, ii. p. 139; Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 113). The number of the towns is given as twelve, though only five are mentioned by name. It is true that some commentators have found the missing names in the border places mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11-14</a>, as, after deducting Chisloth-tabor and Dabrath, which belonged to Issachar, the names Sarid, Maralah, Dabbasheth, Japhia, Gittah-hepher, Eth-kazin, and Channathon give just seven towns. Nevertheless there is very little probability in this conjecture. For, in the first place, not only would it be a surprising thing to find the places mentioned as boundaries included among the towns of the territory belonging to the tribe, especially as some of the places so mentioned did not belong to Zebulun at all; but the copula vav, with which the enumeration of the towns commences, is equally surprising, since this is introduced in other cases with &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;), e.g., <a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>. And, in the second place, it is not a probable thing in itself, that, with the exception of the five towns mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>, the other towns of Zebulun should all be situated upon the border. And lastly, the towns of Kartah and Dimnah, which Zebulun gave up to the Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>), are actually wanting. Under these circumstances, it is a natural conclusion that there is a gap in the text here, just as in <a href="/joshua/15-59.htm">Joshua 15:59</a> and <a href="/joshua/21-36.htm">Joshua 21:36</a>. </body></html>
