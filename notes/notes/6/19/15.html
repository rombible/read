This place, up to which the territory of the Simeonites extended, though without its being actually assigned to the Simeonites, is simply called Baal in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-33.htm">1 Chronicles 4:33</a>, and is probably the same as Bealoth in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-24.htm">Joshua 15:24</a>, though its situation has not yet been determined (see at <a href="/joshua/15-24.htm">Joshua 15:24</a>). It cannot be identified, however, with Ramet el Khulil, an hour to the north of Hebron, which Roediger supposes to be the Ramah of the south, since the territory of Simeon, which was situated in the Negeb, and had only two towns in the shephelah, cannot possibly have extended into the mountains to a point on the north of Hebron. So far as the situation is concerned, V. de Velde would be more likely to be correct, when he identifies Rama of the south with Tell Lekiyeh on the north of Beersheba, if this conjecture only rested upon a better foundation than the untenable assumption, that Baalath-beer is the same as the Baalath of Dan in <a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>. </body></html>
