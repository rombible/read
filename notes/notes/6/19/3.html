If a true believer has obtained an unintended and improper advantage in any thing, he will give it up without murmuring.

The Simeonite territory is described by its towns, of which fourteen were in the Negeb, and four others <a href="/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a> partly in the Negeb and partly in "the valley."

The Lot of Simeon.<p>1. the second lot came forth to Simeon&#8212;The next lot that was drawn at Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the territory, which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of Canaan possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land commenced, was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they had made over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground of that rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which Judah received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too large (Jos 19:9), either for their numbers, however great, to occupy and their arms to defend, or too large in proportion to the allotments of the other tribes. Justice therefore required (what kind and brotherly feeling readily dictated) a modification of their possession; and a part of it was appropriated to Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original domain of another tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was fulfilled (Ge 49:7); for from its boundaries being not traced, there is reason to conclude that its people were divided and dispersed among those of Judah; and though one group of its cities named (Jos 19:2-6), gives the idea of a compact district, as it is usually represented by map makers, the other group (Jos 19:7, 8) were situated, two in the south, and two elsewhere, with tracts of the country around them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Balah, </span> called also <span class="ital">Bilhah</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_chronicles/4-29.htm" title="And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,">1 Chronicles 4:29</a></span>; and <span class="ital">Baalah</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/15-29.htm" title="Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,">Joshua 15:29</a></span>.
