He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses refer to the northern portion of the territory of Asher, on the Phoenician frontier.

Thence the boundary line turned eastward to Beth-dagon, a town at the junction of Zebulun and Naphtali, and ran northwards as far as Cabul, with other towns, among which is mentioned (Jos 19:28) "great Zidon," so called on account of its being even then the flourishing metropolis of the Phœnicians.

Phocas (w) places Cana between Sippori and Nazareth, which is now shown six Roman miles from Sippori to the west, a little inclining to the north; and there is also in the same tract Cephar Cana, four miles from Nazareth to the north, inclining to the east; and it is disputed which of these two is Cana of Galilee the New Testament: with this account agrees pretty much what our countryman Mr. Maundrell (x) gives of his travels in those parts:"taking leave of Nazareth, (he says,) and going at first northward, we crossed the hills that encompassed the vale of Nazareth at that side; after which we turned to the westward, and passed in view of Cana of Galilee, the place signalized with the beginning of Christ's miracles, <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; in an hour and a half more we came to Sepharia;'' <p>or Sippori: <p>even unto great Zidon; of great Zidon, and why so called; see Gill on <a href="/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8</a>. <p>(s) De loc.

Rather, Ebron. It is not the same word as the Hebron in Judah, but is spelt with Ain instead of Hheth. In <a href="/joshua/21-30.htm">Joshua 21:30</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/6-59.htm">1 Chronicles 6:59</a>, Abdon is the name of the city assigned to the Levites in Asher. Twenty MSS., says Keil, have the same reading here. But the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> here and <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/joshua/21-30.htm">Joshua 21:30</a>. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span> are so much alike that there is no doubt that the mistake has arisen earlier than the time when that translation was made. It is true that the lists of Levitical cities in <a href="/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>. and <a href="/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>. do not entirely correspond. But the resemblance here between the names is too striking to allow of the supposition that two different cities are meant. Great Zidon. This city, as well as Tyro, remained unsubdued, although assigned by Joshua to Asher. The boundary of Asher appears to have been traced first towards the west, then eastward, from a middle point on the southern border (see note on ver. 11), then to have been carried northward from the same point (the <span class="accented">left hand</span> usually means the north; see note on Teman, <a href="/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a>), on the east side till it reached Cabul. Then the northern border is traced westward to Sidon. Then the border turned southward along the sea, which is not mentioned, because it would seem to be sufficiently defined by the mention of Ramah and Tyre. Between Hosah and Achzib there would seem to have been a greater paucity of cities, and therefore the sea is mentioned. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the boundary touched Tabor, Sahazim, and Beth-shemesh." Tabor is not the mountain of that name, but a town upon the mountain, which was given to the Levites, though not by Issachar but by Zebulun (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-62.htm">1 Chronicles 6:62</a>), and was fortified afresh in the Jewish wars (Josephus, Bell. Jud. iv. 1, 8). In this passage, however, it appears to be reckoned as belonging to Issachar, since otherwise there are not sixteen cities named. At the same time, as there are several discrepancies between the numbers given and the names actually mentioned, it is quite possible that in this instance also the number sixteen is incorrect. In any case, Tabor was upon the border of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-12.htm">Joshua 19:12</a>), so that it might have been allotted to this tribe. There are still the remains of old walls and ruins or arches, houses, and other buildings to be seen upon Mount Tabor; and round the summit there are the foundations of a thick wall built of large and to a great extent fluted stones (see Rob. iii. pp. 453ff.; Seetzen, ii. p. 148; Buckingham, Syr. i. pp. 83ff.). The places which follow are to be sought for on the east of Tabor towards the Jordan, as the boundary terminated at the Jordan. Sachazim (Shahazimah) Knobel connects with el Hazetheh, as the name, which signifies heights, points to a town situated upon hills; and el Hezetheh stands upon the range of hills, bounding the low-lying land of Ard el Hamma, which belonged to Naphtali. The reason is a weak one, though the situation would suit. There is more probability in the conjecture that Beth-shemesh, which remained in the hands of the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/1-33.htm">Judges 1:33</a>), has been preserved in the ruined village of Bessum (Rob. iii. p. 237), and that this new name is only a corruption of the old one, like Beth-shean and Beisan. It is probable that the eastern portion of the northern boundary of Issachar, towards Naphtali, ran in a north-easterly direction from Tabor through the plain to Kefr Sabt, and thence to the Jordan along the Wady Bessum. It is not stated how far the territory of Issachar ran down the valley of the Jordan (see the remarks on <a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>). </body></html>
