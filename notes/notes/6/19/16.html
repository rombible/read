But it seems to have reached on the one side nearly to the lake of Gennesareth, and on the other to Carmel and the Mediterranean. It enclosed one of the fairest portions of Palestine. Besides the fertile plain near the fisheries of the lake of Gennesareth, and the rich mountain-valleys, the tribe possessed the <span class="ital">goings out</span>, the outlet, of the plain of Akka (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.htm" title="And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>), where he could “dwell at the shore,” and “suck of the abundance of the seas” (<a href="/genesis/49-13.htm" title="Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.">Genesis 49:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm" title="They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>). But though possessing a district excelling in natural beauty and fertility, Zebulun, like the other northern tribes, occupies quite a subordinate position in Old Testament History. We read of it as emerging from its obscurity only on two occasions; (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">first</span>, when side by side with Naphtali the men of the tribe “jeoparded their lives unto the death” upon “the high places” of Tabor in the contest with Sisera; and (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">secondly</span>, when fifty thousand “expert in war,” with “all instruments of war,” came up to the coronation of David at Hebron (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-33.htm" title="Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.">1 Chronicles 12:33</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inheritance of the children of Zebulun.</span> It is strange that the beautiful and fertile land occupied by the tribe of Zebulun does not appear to have brought prosperity with it. Possibly the fact that the "lines" of this tribe had "fallen in pleasant places," had tended to induce sloth. Certain it is that we hear but little of this tribe in the after history of Israel. They were not, like Reuben, absent from the great battle of Tabor, for there we read that, like Issachar, they "jeoparded their lives unto the death" for their homes and liberties. Yet though they seem thenceforth to have slackened in their zeal, theirs was a fair portion. It bordered on the slopes of Tabor, and seems (though the fact is not mentioned here) to have extended to the Sea of Galilee, as we may gather from <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Inheritance of Zebulun fell above the plain of Jezreel, between this plain and the mountains of Naphtali, so that it was bounded by Asher on the west and north-west (<a href="/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), by Naphtali on the north and north-east (<a href="/joshua/19-34.htm">Joshua 19:34</a>), and by Issachar on the south-east and south, and touched neither the Mediterranean Sea nor the Jordan. It embraced a very fertile country, however, with the fine broad plain of el Buttauf, the &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; above Nazareth called Asochis in Joseph. vita, 41, 45 (see Rob. iii. p. 189, Bibl. Res. pp. 105ff.; Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 742, 758-9).<p><a href="/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10</a><p>"And the boundary (the territory) of their inheritance was (went) to Sarid." This is no doubt the centre of the southern boundary, from which it is traced in a westerly direction in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11</a>, and in an easterly direction in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-12.htm">Joshua 19:12</a>, in the same manner as in <a href="/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>. Unfortunately, Sarid cannot be determined with certainty. Knobel's opinion, is, that the name, which signifies "hole" or "incision," after the analogy of &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1491;, perforavit, and &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1496;, incidit, does not refer to a town, but to some other locality, probably the southern opening of the deep and narrow wady which comes down from the basin of Nazareth, and is about an hour to the south-east of Nazareth, between two steep mountains (Seetzen, ii. pp. 151-2; Rob. iii. p. 183). This locality appears suitable enough. But it is also possible that Sarid may be found in one of the two heaps of ruins on the south side of the Mons praecipitii upon V. de Velde's map (so called from <a href="/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a>).</body></html>
