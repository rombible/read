The Lot of Simeon.<p>1. the second lot came forth to Simeon&#8212;The next lot that was drawn at Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the territory, which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of Canaan possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land commenced, was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they had made over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground of that rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which Judah received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too large (Jos 19:9), either for their numbers, however great, to occupy and their arms to defend, or too large in proportion to the allotments of the other tribes. Justice therefore required (what kind and brotherly feeling readily dictated) a modification of their possession; and a part of it was appropriated to Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original domain of another tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was fulfilled (Ge 49:7); for from its boundaries being not traced, there is reason to conclude that its people were divided and dispersed among those of Judah; and though one group of its cities named (Jos 19:2-6), gives the idea of a compact district, as it is usually represented by map makers, the other group (Jos 19:7, 8) were situated, two in the south, and two elsewhere, with tracts of the country around them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ain, Remmon,....

Thus the curse pronounced upon Simeon by Jacob of dispersion in Israel (<a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>) was fulfilled upon this tribe in a very peculiar manner, and in a different manner from that pronounced upon Levi. The towns allotted to the tribe of Simeon are divided into two groups, the first (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2-6</a>) consisting of thirteen or fourteen towns, all situated in the Negeb (or south country); the second (<a href="/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a>) of four towns, two of which were in the Negeb and two in the shephelah. All these eighteen towns have already been enumerated among the towns of Judah (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-26.htm">Joshua 15:26-32</a>, <a href="/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>), and are mentioned again in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-28.htm">1 Chronicles 4:28-32</a>, in just the same order, and with only slight differences in the spelling of some of the names. If the classification of the names in two groups might seem to indicate that Simeon received a connected portion of land in Judah, this idea is overthrown at once by the circumstance that two of the four towns in the second group were in the south land and two in the lowland, and, judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>, at a great distance from one another. At the same time, we cannot decide this point with any certainty, as the situation of several of the towns is still unknown.</body></html>
