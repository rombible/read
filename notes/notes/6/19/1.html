In this fact a prophecy was fulfilled; for the effect of the allotment was to separate Simeon from the tribes with whom he had been united in the journey through the wilderness (viz., Reuben and Gad), who had cast off Simeon, and united themselves with the half tribe of Manasseh instead. Being also separated from Levi, Simeon was still further isolated: with the result that in the final separation of Israel and Judah, after Solomon’s death, the tribe of Simeon, though adhering to the kingdom of the ten tribes (for the children of Simeon were counted <span class= "ital">strangers </span>in Judah—<a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9</a>), was separated from the territory of that kingdom by the whole breadth of the kingdom of Judah.

The Lot of Simeon.<p>1. the second lot came forth to Simeon&#8212;The next lot that was drawn at Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the territory, which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of Canaan possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land commenced, was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they had made over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground of that rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which Judah received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too large (Jos 19:9), either for their numbers, however great, to occupy and their arms to defend, or too large in proportion to the allotments of the other tribes. Justice therefore required (what kind and brotherly feeling readily dictated) a modification of their possession; and a part of it was appropriated to Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original domain of another tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was fulfilled (Ge 49:7); for from its boundaries being not traced, there is reason to conclude that its people were divided and dispersed among those of Judah; and though one group of its cities named (Jos 19:2-6), gives the idea of a compact district, as it is usually represented by map makers, the other group (Jos 19:7, 8) were situated, two in the south, and two elsewhere, with tracts of the country around them.The second lot falls to Simeon; his borders among the tribe of Judah, whose inheritance was too great for them, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah....">Joshua 19:1-9</a></span>.

To Simeon accordingly was allotted a district out of the territory of his kinsman, whose ancestor like his had been the child of Leah (<a href="/genesis/35-23.htm" title="The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:">Genesis 35:23</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in the midst of.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">in medio</span>, Vulgate (cf. ver. 9). Simeon, at the last census (<a href="/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>), was the smallest of the tribes of Israel, a fulfilment of the prophecy of Jacob, and possibly the result of the command given in <a href="/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, since the Simeonites were the chief offenders on that occasion (<a href="/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>; see also <a href="/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>). The distribution of territory was in accordance with this, and it is possible that the lot only determined the priority of choice among the tribes. The territory of Judah seems to have been recognised as too large, in spite of the importance of the tribe. They therefore willingly gave up a portion of their territory to the Simeonites. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Avvim (i.e., ruins) is unknown.
