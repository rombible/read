He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jezreel and its famous and fertile plain are the choicest part of the inheritance of Issachar <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>.<p>Shunem - Here the Philistines pitched before the battle of Gilboa <a href="/1_samuel/28-4.htm">1 Samuel 28:4</a>.

Ahaziah was driving towards the mountain-pass by En-gannim (<a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm" title="But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house.

Judging from the words &#1504;&#1505;&#1489; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, this verse apparently gives the north-west boundary, since the last definition in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-13.htm">Joshua 19:13</a>, "to Gath-hepher," etc., points to the eastern boundary. Jiphtah-el answers no doubt to the present Jeft, two hours and a half to the north of Sefurieh, and is the Jotapata which was obstinately defended by Josephus (Bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.7, <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/9.htm">Jude 9</a>:see Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 104ff.). Consequently the valley of Jiphtah-el, at which Zebulun touched Asher (<a href="/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), is probably "no other than the large Wady Abiln, which takes its rise in the hills in the neighbourhood of Jeft" (Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 107). And if this be correct, Channathon (lxx &#x395;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;) is probably Cana of Galilee, the home of Nathanael (<a href="//biblehub.com/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1</a>, <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>; <a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>), the present Kana el Jelil, between Rummaneh and Yeft, on the northern edge of the plain of Buttauf, upon a Tell, from which you overlook the plain, fully two hours and a half in a straight line from Nazareth, and directly north of that place, where there are many ruins found (see Rob. iii. p. 204; Bibl. Res. p. 108).</body></html>
