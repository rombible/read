He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>En-gannim - i. e.

Engannim is now called Jenine, distant from Tabor twenty two miles, a place of gardens, of water, and of pleasure, as a traveller (b) of ours tells us; who also declares (c), that, in his whole journey from Damascus to Jerusalem, he saw not more fruitful ground, and so much together, than he did in twenty two miles of riding between Mount Tabor and Engannim. This seems to be the same place Mr. Maundrell (d) calls Jeneen, a large old town on the outskirts of Esdraelon. Dr. Lightfoot (e) is inclined to believe, that Nain, where the widow's son was raised to life, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11</a>, is the same with Engannim, for which he gives various reasons: <p>and Enhaddah; Jerom says, in his time (f) there was a village called Enadda, ten miles from Eleutheropolis, as you go from thence to Aelia; but seems not to be the same with Enhaddah here: <p>and Bethpazzez; of Bethpazzez no mention is made elsewhere. "Beth" signifies a "house", and "Pazzez" in the Arabic tongue signifies "silver"; so this with the old Canaanites might be a treasure city, like those in Egypt, <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>. But where a word begins with "Beth", as the name of a place, I always suspect there was an idol temple there; now as the word in Hebrew signifies the same as "Peor", opening, here might be a temple to that deity, or to one that was similar to the god of the Moabites, and design a Priapus, among the Canaanites like that; or as the word in the Syriac and Chaldee languages signifies to redeem, deliver, and save, this temple might be dedicated to some idol as their deliverer and saviour. <p>(b) Biddulph apud Lightfoot.

It was one of the Levitical cities of Issachar (<a href="/joshua/21-29.htm">Joshua 21:29</a>). Robinson, Vandevelde, and others identify it with the modern Jenin, the Ginaea of Josephus. The meaning of the name is "fountain of the gardens" and the present Jenin is situated, so Robinson tells us, in the midst of gardens. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The towns of Zebulun were the following. Kattath, probably the same as Kitron, which is mentioned in <a href="/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a> in connection with Nahalol, but which is still unknown. Nehalal, or Nahalol (<a href="/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>), is supposed by V. de Velde (Mem. p. 335), who follows Rabbi Schwartz, to be the present village of Maalul, a place with ruins on the south-west of Nazareth (see Seetzen, ii. p. 143; Rob. iii. App.; and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 700). Simron is supposed by Knobel to be the village of Semunieh (see at <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>). But neither of these is very probable. Idalah is supposed by V. de Velde to be the village of Jeda or Jeida, on the west of Semunieh, where are a few relics of antiquity, though Robinson (Bibl. Res. p. 113) states the very opposite. Bethlehem (of Zebulun), which many regard as the home of the judge Ibzan (<a href="/judges/12-8.htm">Judges 12:8</a>), has been preserved under the old name in a miserable village on the north of Jeida and Semunieh (see Seetzen, ii. p. 139; Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 113). The number of the towns is given as twelve, though only five are mentioned by name. It is true that some commentators have found the missing names in the border places mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11-14</a>, as, after deducting Chisloth-tabor and Dabrath, which belonged to Issachar, the names Sarid, Maralah, Dabbasheth, Japhia, Gittah-hepher, Eth-kazin, and Channathon give just seven towns. Nevertheless there is very little probability in this conjecture. For, in the first place, not only would it be a surprising thing to find the places mentioned as boundaries included among the towns of the territory belonging to the tribe, especially as some of the places so mentioned did not belong to Zebulun at all; but the copula vav, with which the enumeration of the towns commences, is equally surprising, since this is introduced in other cases with &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;), e.g., <a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>. And, in the second place, it is not a probable thing in itself, that, with the exception of the five towns mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>, the other towns of Zebulun should all be situated upon the border. And lastly, the towns of Kartah and Dimnah, which Zebulun gave up to the Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>), are actually wanting. Under these circumstances, it is a natural conclusion that there is a gap in the text here, just as in <a href="/joshua/15-59.htm">Joshua 15:59</a> and <a href="/joshua/21-36.htm">Joshua 21:36</a>. </body></html>
