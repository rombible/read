The boundary passed westward until it touched the Kishon, near "Tell Kaimon" (<a href="/joshua/12-22.htm">Joshua 12:22</a> note), and thence, turned northward, leaving Carmel, which belonged to Asher, on its west. The territory of Zebulun accordingly would not anywhere reach to the Mediterranean, though its eastern side abutted on the sea of Galilee, and gave the tribe those "outgoings" attributed to it in the Blessing of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.htm">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>).

During the journey from Egypt to Palestine, the tribe of Zebulun formed one of the first camp, with Judah and Issachar, also sons of Leah, marching under the standard of Judah.
