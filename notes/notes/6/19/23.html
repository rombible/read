He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>En-gannim - i. e.

On the north is Tabor, which even under the burning sun of the climate is said to retain the glades and dells of an English wood. On the east, behind Jezreel, is the opening which conducts to the plain of the Jordan—to the Bethshean, which was proverbially among the Rabbis the Gate of Paradise for its fruitfulness.” The soil yielded corn and figs, wine and oil (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-40.htm" title="Moreover they that were near them, even to Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.">1 Chronicles 12:40</a>); the stately palm waved over the villages; and the very weeds testify to the extraordinary fertility of the Esdraelon plain.

See Porter’s <span class="ital">Handbook</span>, ii. 352; Stanley’s <span class="ital">S. and P</span>., p. 348. “Two things strike us forcibly in looking over the plain of Esdraelon, and in wandering through it:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">First, its wonderful richness</span>. After the grey hills of Judah, and the rocky mountains of Ephraim, the traveller looks with admiration over this unbroken extent of verdure. The luxuriant grass, and the exuberance of the crops on the few spots where it is cultivated, amply prove the fertility of the soil. It was the frontier of Zebulun. ‘Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thy <span class="ital">goings out</span>’ (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.htm" title="And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>)&emsp;&emsp;<span class="ital">Second, its desolation</span>. If we except its eastern branches there is not a single inhabited village on its whole surface, and not more than one-sixth of its soil is cultivated. It is the home of the wandering Bedawy, who can scour its smooth turf on his fleet mare in search of plunder, and when hard pressed can speedily remove his tents and his flocks beyond the Jordan, and beyond the reach of a weak government. In its condition, thus exposed to every hasty incursion, and to every shock of war, we read the fortunes of that tribe which for the sake of its richness consented to sink into a half nomadic state. ‘Rejoice, O Issachar, in thy <span class="ital">tents</span>’ (<a href="/context/genesis/49-14.htm" title="Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:...">Genesis 49:14-15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.htm" title="And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.">Deuteronomy 33:18</a>). Their exposed position and valuable possessions made them eager for the succession of David to the throne, as one under whose sceptre they would enjoy the peace and rest they loved.” See <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm" title="And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their commandment.">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-40.htm" title="Moreover they that were near them, even to Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.">1 Chronicles 12:40</a>.

Situated in the midst of this fertile plain, accessible alike to Egypt by the way of the Shephelah, and to the east by way of the fords of the Jordan, the tribe of Issachar became in the end the prey of the various nationalities, who made the plain of Esdraelon their battlefield, and it was the first to "bow his shoulder to bear" and to "become a servant unto tribute" (<a href="/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>). It seems to have been to the east of Manasseh (see <a href="/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>), and may have extended much further south than is usually supposed. Since but small mention of the Jordan is made in the boundary of Joseph, it may have extended as far or farther south than the Jabbok (see also note, <a href="/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>). The general belief of explorers at present is that the inheritance of Issachar extended from Jezreel to the Jordan, and from the Sea of Tiberias southward as far as the border of Manasseh, above mentioned. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Inheritance of Issachar. - In this instance only towns are given, and the boundaries are not delineated, with the exception of the eastern portion of the northern boundary and the boundary line; at the same time, they may easily be traced from the boundaries of the surrounding tribes. Issachar received for the most part the large and very fertile plain of Jezreel (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>, and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 689ff.), and was bounded on the south by Manasseh, on the west by Manasseh and Asher, on the north by Zebulun, and farther east by Naphtali also, and on the east by the Jordan.</body></html>
