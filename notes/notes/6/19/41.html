He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The number of the fortified cities of Naphtali is remarkable, though it does not tally with the catalogue. It was no doubt good policy to protect the northern frontier by a belt of fortresses, as the south was protected by the fenced cities of Judah. Hammath, a Levitical city (compare <a href="/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-76.htm">1 Chronicles 6:76</a>), is not to be confounded with the Hamath on the northeastern frontier of the land <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>. The name (from a root signifying "to be warm") probably indicates that hot springs existed here; and is perhaps rightly traced in Ammaus, near Tiberias. Rakkath was, according to the rabbis, rebuilt by Herod and called Tiberias. The name ("bank, shore") suits the site of Tiberias very well.

Ziddim: unknown, though Knobel suggests that "it may possibly be preserved in Chirbet es Saudeh, to the west of the southern extremity of the Lake of Tiberias (Rob. iii. App.);" but this place is to the west of the Wady Bessum, i.e., in the territory of Issachar. Zer is also unknown. As the lxx and Syriac give the name as Zor, Knobel connects it with Kerak, which signifies fortress as well as Zor ( equals  &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1512;), a heap of ruins at the southern end of the lake (Rob. iii. p. 263), the place which Josephus calls Taricheae (see Reland, p. 1026), - a very doubtful combination! Hammath (i.e., thermae), a Levitical town called Hammaoth-dor in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>, and Hammon in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a>, was situated, according to statements in the Talmud, somewhere near the later city of Tiberias, on the western shore of the Lake of Gennesareth, and was no doubt identical with the &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b5; &#x391;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; in the neighbourhood of Tiberias, a place with warm baths (Jos. Ant. xviii. 2, 3; Bell. Judg. iv. 1, 3). There are warm springs still to be found half an hour to the south of Tabaria, which are used as baths (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 573-4; Rob. iii. pp. 258ff.). Rakkath (according to the Talm. and Rabb. ripa littus) was situated, according to rabbinical accounts, in the immediate neighbourhood of Hammath, and was the same place as Tiberias; but the account given by Josephus (Ant. xviii. 2, 3; cf. Bell. Judg. ii. 9, 1) respecting the founding of Tiberias by Herod the tetrarch is at variance with this; so that the rabbinical statements appear to have no other foundation than the etymology of the name Rakkath. Chinnereth is given in the Targums as &#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512;, &#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;, i.e., &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;. According to Josephus (Bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.10, 8), this name was given to a strip of land on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, which was distinguished for its natural beauty, its climate, and its fertility, namely the long plain, about twenty minutes broad and an hour long, which stretches along the western shore of this lake, from el-Mejdel on the south to Khan Minyeh on the north (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 558-9; Rob. iii. pp. 279, 290). It must have been in this plain that the town of Chinnereth stood, from which the plain and lake together derived the name of Chinnereth (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>) or Chinneroth (<a href="/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>), and the lake alone the name of "Sea of Chinnereth," or "Sea of Chinneroth" (<a href="/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>; <a href="/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>).</body></html>
