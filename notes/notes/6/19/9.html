The Lot of Simeon.<p>1. the second lot came forth to Simeon&#8212;The next lot that was drawn at Shiloh, gave the tribe of Simeon his inheritance within the territory, which had been assigned to that of Judah. The knowledge of Canaan possessed by the Israelites, when the division of the land commenced, was but very general, being derived from the rapid sweep they had made over it during the course of conquest; and it was on the ground of that rough survey alone that the distribution proceeded, by which Judah received an inheritance. Time showed that this territory was too large (Jos 19:9), either for their numbers, however great, to occupy and their arms to defend, or too large in proportion to the allotments of the other tribes. Justice therefore required (what kind and brotherly feeling readily dictated) a modification of their possession; and a part of it was appropriated to Simeon. By thus establishing it within the original domain of another tribe, the prophecy of Jacob in regard to Simeon was fulfilled (Ge 49:7); for from its boundaries being not traced, there is reason to conclude that its people were divided and dispersed among those of Judah; and though one group of its cities named (Jos 19:2-6), gives the idea of a compact district, as it is usually represented by map makers, the other group (Jos 19:7, 8) were situated, two in the south, and two elsewhere, with tracts of the country around them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon,....

In the prophecy of Moses he is not even mentioned (Deuteronomy 33), nor are we told what part he took at the time of the division of the kingdom. “As time rolled on, the tribe gradually crossed the imperceptible boundary between civilisation and barbarism, between Palestine and the Desert, and, in ‘the days of Hezekiah’ (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/4-28.htm" title="And they dwelled at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,...">1 Chronicles 4:28-43</a>), they wandered forth to the east to seek pasture for their flocks, and ‘smote the tents’ of the pastoral tribes who had ‘dwelt there of old;’ and roved along across the <span class="ital">’Arabah</span> till they arrived at the ‘Mount Seir’—the range of Petra—and ‘smote the rest of the Amalekites, and dwelt there unto this day.’ ” Stanley, <span class="ital">Sinai and Palestine</span>, p. 161. “It is startling to find that a tribe professing to be” of the “sons of Israel,” and holding no connection with the Arabs of the district, is still to be found in the country around Petra, literally fulfilling an ancient prediction:—“They of the South (= the <span class="ital">Negeb</span>) shall possess the mount of Esau.” See Pusey’s <span class="ital">Commentary</span> on <a href="/obadiah/1-19.htm" title="And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.">Obadiah 1:19</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance.</span> Of the later history of the children of Simeon we find a little recorded in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">1 Chronicles 4:39-42</a>, and some suppose that the event recorded there is a fulfilment of the prophecy in <a href="/obadiah/1-19.htm">Obadiah 1:19</a>. Dr. Pusey mentions a tribe still existing in the south, professing to be of the sons of Israel, and holding no connection with the Arabs of the neighbourhood, and supposes them to be the descendants of the five hundred Simeonites who took possession of Mount Seir in the days of Hezekiah.
