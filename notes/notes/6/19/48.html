He was content to be unfixed, till he saw them all placed, and herein is an example to all in public places, to prefer the common welfare before private advantage. Those who labour most to do good to others, seek an inheritance in the Canaan above: but it will be soon enough to enter thereon, when they have done all the service to their brethren of which they are capable. Nor can any thing more effectually assure them of their title to it, than endeavouring to bring others to desire, to seek, and to obtain it. Our Lord Jesus came and dwelt on earth, not in pomp but poverty, providing rest for man, yet himself not having where to lay his head; for Christ pleased not himself. Nor would he enter upon his inheritance, till by his obedience to death he secured the eternal inheritance for all his people; nor will he account his own glory completed, till every ransomed sinner is put in possession of his heavenly rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words "too little" are an insertion of the King James Version Render rather, "the border of the children of Dan was extended." The Hebrew appears to mean "the children of Dan enlarged their border because they had not room enough."<p>The reason of this was that the Danites, a numerous tribe (<a href="/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5</a> note), found themselves <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34-35</a> cooped up among the hills by the powerful and warlike Amorites. Hence, the Danite expedition (see the marginal reference), which surprised the Sidonion inhabitants of Leshem, an unwarlike and peaceable race, exterminated them, and annexed their city and territory to the portion of Dan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47. the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem&#8212;The Danites, finding their inheritance too small, decided to enlarge its boundaries by the sword; and, having conquered Leshem (Laish), they planted a colony there, calling the new settlement by the name of Dan (see on [200]Jud 18:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan,.... Before described by its cities, which were in it. This tribe was bounded by Ephraim on the north, by Judah on the east, by Simeon on the south, and by the Mediterranean sea on the west. Josephus (h) says, the Danites enjoyed the vale which lies to the setting sun, bounded by Azotus and Doris, and all Jamnia and Getta, from Accaron (or Ekron) to the mountain from whence the tribe of Judah begins: <p>according to their families; which inheritance was distributed according to the number of their families: <p>their cities with their villages; before named. <p>(h) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 1. sect. 22. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joshua/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joshua/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">48</span>. <span class="ital">This is the inheritance of the tribe … of Dan</span>] In length it extends but 14 miles from Joppa to Ekron, but it was one of the most fertile tracts in the land, the cornfield and garden of southern Palestine. The dying Jacob had said of the tribe (<a href="/genesis/49-16.htm" title="Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.">Genesis 49:16</a>):<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Dan shall <span class="ital">judge</span> his people,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As one of the tribes of Israel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dan shall be a <span class="ital">serpent by the way</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An <span class="ital">adder</span> in the path,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That <span class="ital">biteth the horse heels</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So that his rider shall fall backward;”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and, as it has been observed, “the privilege of Dan was, that he was to lie in wait for the invader from the south or from the north.” “<span class="ital">A serpent</span>,” an indigenous, home-born “<span class="ital">adder</span>,” to bite the heels of the invading stranger’s horse; “<span class="ital">a lion’s whelp</span>” (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-22.htm" title="And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.">Deuteronomy 33:22</a>), small and fierce, to “<span class="ital">leap from the heights of Bashan</span>,” on the armies of Damascus or Nineveh. “<span class="ital">For thy salvation, O Lord, have I waited</span>” seems to have been his war cry, as if of a warrior in the constant attitude of expectation. Once only in the history of the tribe, so far as we know, was this expectation fully realised—in the life of Samson.

Saalabbin, or Saalbim, which remained in the hands of the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>), is frequently mentioned in the history of David and Solomon (<a href="/2_samuel/23-32.htm">2 Samuel 23:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-33.htm">1 Chronicles 11:33</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-9.htm">1 Kings 4:9</a>). It may possibly be the present Selbt (Rob. iii. App.; Bibl. Res. p. 144), some distance to the north of the three places mentioned (Knobel). Ajalon, which was also not taken from the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>), was assigned to the Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-54.htm">1 Chronicles 6:54</a>). It is mentioned in the wars with the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-31.htm">1 Samuel 14:31</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-13.htm">1 Chronicles 8:13</a>), was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>), and was taken by the Philistines from King Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). It has been preserved in the village of Yalo (see at <a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>). Jethlah is only mentioned here, and has not yet been discovered. So far as the name is concerned, it may possibly be preserved in the Wady Atallah, on the west of Yalo (Bibl. Res. pp. 143-4).</body></html>
