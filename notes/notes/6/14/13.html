Those who live by faith value that which is given by God's promise, far above what is given by his providence only. It was now in the Anakims' possession, and Caleb would let Israel know how little he feared the enemy, and that he would encourage them to push on their conquests. Caleb answered to his name, which signifies all heart. Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs, because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. Happy are we if we follow him.

Thence, they had, as must be inferred from the text here, returned and reoccupied Hebron, probably when Joshua and the main force of the Israelites had marched northward to deal with Jabin and his confederates.

Before the casting of the lots commenced, Caleb came to Joshua along with the sons of Judah, and asked for the mountains of Hebron for his possession, appealing at the same time to the fact, that forty-five years before Moses had promised it to him on oath, because he had not discouraged the people and stirred them up to rebellion, as the other spies that were sent from Kadesh to Canaan had done, but had faithfully followed the Lord.<p>(Note: The grounds upon which Knobel follows Maurer and others in affirming that this account does not belong to the so-called Elohist, but is merely a fragment taken from the first document of the Jehovist, are formed partly from misinterpretations of particular verses and partly from baseless assumptions. To the former belongs the assertion, that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-8.htm">Joshua 14:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>, Joshua was not one of the spies (see the remarks on <a href="/joshua/14-8.htm">Joshua 14:8</a>); to the latter the assertion, that the Elohist does not represent Joshua as dividing the land, or Caleb as receiving so large a territory (see on the contrary, however, the exposition of <a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13</a>), as well as the enumeration of all kinds of words which are said to be foreign to the Elohistic document.)<p>This occurred at Gilgal, where the casting of the lots as to take place. Caleb was not "the head of the Judahites," as Knobel maintains, but simply the head of a father's house of Judah, and, as we may infer from his surname, "the Kenizzite" or descendant of Kenaz ("the Kenizzite" here and <a href="/numbers/32-12.htm">Numbers 32:12</a> is equivalent to "son of Kenaz," <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>, and <a href="/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>), head of the father's house which sprang from Kenaz, i.e., of a subdivision of the Judahite family of Hezron; for Caleb, the brother of Jerahmeel and father of Achzah, according to <a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a> (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/2-49.htm">1 Chronicles 2:49</a>), was the same person as Caleb the descendant of Hezron mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>. From the surname "the Kenizzite" we are of course not to understand that Caleb or his father Jephunneh is described as a descendant of the Canaanitish tribe of Kenizzites (<a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>); but Kenaz was a descendant of Hezron, the son of Perez and grandson of Judah (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-5.htm">1 Chronicles 2:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/2-25.htm">1 Chronicles 2:25</a>), of whom nothing further is known. Consequently it was not the name of a tribe, but of a person, and, as we may see from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-15.htm">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>, where one of the sons of Caleb is called Kenaz, the name was repeated in the family. The sons of Judah who came to Joshua along with Caleb were not the Judahites generally, therefore, or representatives of all the families of Judah, but simply members or representatives of the father's house of Judah which took its name from Kenaz, and of which Caleb was the head at that time. Caleb reminded Joshua of the word which the Lord had spoken concerning them in Kadesh-barnea, i.e., the promise of God that they should both of them enter the land of Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>), and then proceeded to observe (<a href="/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7</a>): "When I was forty years old, and was sent by Moses as a spy to Canaan, I brought back an answer as it was in my mind," i.e., according to the best of my convictions, without fear of man or regard to the favour of the people. </body></html>
