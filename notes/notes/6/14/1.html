This is in strict accordance with the law of Moses, and the form of government which he was ordered to establish in Israel, to continue after his death. See Numbers 27, where, in answer to Moses prayer for a shepherd in Israel, the Lord says, “Take thee Joshua (here a figure of the great “Shepherd, the stone of Israel”), and lay thine hand upon him; and (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm" title="And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.">Numbers 27:21</a>) he (Joshua) shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask <span class= "ital">counsel </span>for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord; at his (Eleazar’s) word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he (Joshua) and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.” (Comp. also <a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm" title="And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:">Deuteronomy 17:9</a> : “Thou shalt come unto the <span class= "ital">priests </span>(at the place which the Lord shall choose), and unto the <span class= "ital">judge </span>that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment.”) In these passages we <span class= "ital">see </span>delineated the nature of the government established in Israel by Moses, to continue until there was a king. The priest had the <span class= "ital">legislative </span>authority, the <span class= "ital">executive power </span>rested with the <span class= "ital">judge. </span>Of these judges, Joshua stands first; those who followed, until Samuel, held the same relation to the priest. Joshua was also a prophet. Samuel (a prophet likewise) established a third power in the constitution, and made the supreme executive power continuous and hereditary, giving to Israel a form of government by prophet, priest, and king. For the present, however, Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun (the answer to Moses’ prayer for a shepherd) were the rulers. “To lead them out and to bring them in” was what Moses asked that the shepherd of Israel might do. Joshua had led them out to victory; he was now to bring in each of the tribes into the home that the Lord had chosen for it in the promised land.<p><span class= "bld">And the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.</span>—These men are all <span class= "ital">named </span>in <a href="/context/numbers/34-16.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 34:16-28</a> : one from every tribe, in addition to Eleazar and Joshua. The names were then given by God to Moses, as the narrative states in <a href="/context/numbers/34-16.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 34:16-19</a>. But is it not remarkable that before the land was conquered, in view of all the battles that were to be fought before it could be divided, the names of the men who were to divide it should be revealed? Man could not have arranged it so. The bow drawn at a venture, or one false step in the heat of battle, or the hurry of pursuit or flight, might have made a gap in the list. But it was not to be. “The Lord hath kept me alive,” says Caleb (the first man after Joshua on this list) in <a href="/joshua/14-10.htm" title="And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, see, I am this day fourscore and five years old.">Joshua 14:10</a>. But all the twelve commissioners might have said the same. We cannot forbear to ask the question—Is it conceivable that, were the narrative in Numbers 34 anything but simple truth, it should contain such an unlikely statement as this? It will not do to say the names in the Book of Numbers were added afterwards; the form of the language in which they are given forbids this, and, with the single exception of Caleb, we know nothing of these twelve commissioners except their names.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joshua/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/joshua/14-1.htm" title="And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.">Joshua 14:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">And these are the countries — </span>Namely, those mentioned in the 15th, 16th, and following chapters, to the 20th; for this chapter is but a kind of preface to the division of the land; which was now conquered by Joshua, as that of Sihon and Og had been by Moses; and was to be divided by lot according to the command given by God to Moses, <a href="/context/numbers/34-17.htm" title="These are the names of the men which shall divide the land to you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun....">Numbers 34:17-18</a>, where the names of the twelve heads of tribes, or princes, as they are there called, are set down. <span class="ital">Eleazar the priest and Joshua, </span>&c. — They best understood the laws of God by which this division was to be regulated.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joshua/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 The Israelites must occupy the new conquests.
