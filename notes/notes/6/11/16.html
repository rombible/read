The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render: "But the cities standing each on its own hill" (compare <a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>). The meaning is simply that, with the exception of Hazor, Joshua did not burn the cities, but left them standing, each on its former site. This site is spoken of as a hill, because such was the ordinary site chosen for cities in Canaan (compare <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The division of the country there into five parts; namely, the hills, the land of Goshen, that is, a pastoral land near Gibeon (Jos 10:41); the valley, the plains and the mountains of Israel, i. e., Carmel, rests upon a diversity of geographical positions, which is characteristic of the region.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All that land, </span> of Cannaan, whose parts here follow. <span class="ital">The hill</span>, or, <span class="ital">the mountain</span>, i.e. the mountainous country, to wit, of Judea, as may seem, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

It must not be pressed to mean the utter destruction of all the Canaanites, and the undisturbed possession of the country. <span class="cmt_word">The hills.</span> The mountain country of Judah, in the south. The same word is translated "mountain" immediately afterwards, to the confusion of the sense, which contrasts the mountains of Israel with the mountains of Judah (see ver. 21). This would seem at first sight to lead to the conclusion that the Book of Joshua was composed after the jealousy between Judah and the rest of Israel had sprung up in the time of David (see <a href="/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41</a>-48). But Dr. Edersheim has suggested another explanation. Judah, he says (see <a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a>), entered upon their inheritance, while the other tribes were still in Gilgal. In the same way Mount Ephraim is so called because it was given to that tribe, and occupied by them shortly after. While as the remaining seven tribes remained without their inheritance (Reuben and Gad as well as Manasseh and Ephraim being now provided for), the rest of the mountains were known as the mountains of Israel. This explanation is ingenious, but hardly satisfactory. Ephraim (see <a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1</a>) early acquired a preponderance over the other tribes. We should therefore expect a threefold division of the mountain district, the mountains of Judah, of Joseph, and of Israel, especially as Ephraim was the next after Judah to enter upon its inheritance. The internal evidence seems to prove that the Book of Joshua was written by one of the tribe of Judah, or by a Levite residing within the borders of that tribe. Perhaps this affords the best explanation, but is quite possible that the whole mountain district of Palestine is here meant. <span class="cmt_word">The south.</span> The Negeb, or dry country (see <a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The valley.</span> The <span class="accented">Shephelah</span>, or lowlands (see note on Joshua 9:1). This must have extended from Gaza northward to Joppa, while the Shephelah of Israel mentioned immediately below must be the lowland tract from Joppa to Mount Carmel. <span class="cmt_word">The plain</span>. The Arabah (see note on Joshua 3:16). <span class="cmt_word">And the valley of the same.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">his</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Israel's) <span class="accented">lowland.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After destroying the foe, and returning from the pursuit, Joshua took Hazor, smote its king and all the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and burned the town, the former leader of all those kingdoms. He did just the same to the other towns, except that he did not burn them, but left them standing upon their hills. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/joshua/11-13.htm">Joshua 11:13</a>) neither contains an allusion to any special fortification of the towns, nor implies a contrast to the towns built in the valleys and plains, but simply expresses the thought that these towns were still standing upon their hill, i.e., upon the old site (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a> : the participle does not express the preterite, but the present). At the same time, the expression certainly implies that the towns were generally built upon hills. The pointing in &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is not to be altered, as Knobel suggests. The singular "upon their hill" is to be taken as distributive: standing, now as then, each upon its hill. - With <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-15.htm">Joshua 11:15</a>, "as Jehovah commanded His servant Moses" (cf. <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>.; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>., <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16</a>), the account of the wars of Joshua is brought to a close, and the way opened for proceeding to the concluding remarks with reference to the conquest of the whole land (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16-23</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1492;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, he put not away a word, i.e., left nothing undone. </body></html>
