The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, heaped up, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, defended with mounds. Rather, <span class="accented">on their hill</span> ("in collibus et in tumulis sitae," Vulg.). As many of the towns in Italy, and the castles in Germany in the middle ages, so these Phoenician cities were placed upon hills, that they might be more easily defended. The various tribes of Palestine were no doubt continually at war, and, as regards these northern tribes at least, were not accustomed to subsist by commerce. Therefore each of these cities stood (the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span> surely implies <span class="accented">situation</span> here) on its own hill, a detail possibly obtained from an eyewitness, who was probably struck by this feature of the district, a feature he had not observed before. The expression is used, however, as Masius observes, by Jeremiah (Joshua 30:18). Knobel observes that all the early versions have no suffix here. What he calls the "free translation," however, of the LXX. (which has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) requires the suffix, though the Vulgate requires none. We must not adopt the very plausible explanation of Knobel and others that Joshua burnt the cities in the valleys, but spared the cities on the hills, because they could be more easily defended (see <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>; <a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19, 34</a>), since we read that Hazor alone was burnt. The word here translated hill (<span class="accented">Tell</span>, Arabic) is one with which we are familiar in the modern name of places in Palestine (see note on Joshua 8:28). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With this to inspirit them, the Israelites fell upon the enemy and smote them, chasing them towards the north-west to Sidon, and westwards as far as Misrephothmaim, and into the plain of Mizpah on the east. Sidon is called the great (as in <a href="/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>), because at that time it was the metropolis of Phoenicia; whereas even by the time of David it had lost its ancient splendour, and was outstripped by its daughter city Tyre. It is still to be seen in the town of Saida, a town of five or six thousand inhabitants, with many large and well-built houses (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 415, and Movers, Phnizier, ii. 1, pp. 86ff.). Misrephothmaim (mentioned also at <a href="/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>), which the Greek translators have taken as a proper name, though the Rabbins and some Christian commentators render it in different ways, such as salt-pits, smelting-huts, or glass-huts (see Ges. Thes. p. 1341), is a collection of springs, called Ain Mesherfi, at the foot of the promontory to which with its steep pass the name of Ras el Nakhra is given, the scala Tyriorum or Passepoulain of the Crusaders (see V. de Velde, Mem. p. 335, and Ritter, Erdk. xvi. p. 807). &#1502;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1514; (Eng. Ver. "the valley of Mizpeh") is probably the basin of the Huleh lake and of Nahr Hasbany, on the western side of which lay the land of Mizpah (<a href="/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>).</body></html>
