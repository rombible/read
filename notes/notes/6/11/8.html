Thus the war against Satan's kingdom, carried on by preaching the gospel, was at first forwarded by miracles; but being fully proved to be of God, we are now left to the Divine grace in the usual course, in the use of the sword of the Spirit. God encouraged Joshua. Fresh dangers and difficulties make it necessary to seek fresh supports from the word of God, which we have nigh unto us for use in every time of need. God proportions our trials to our strength, and our strength to our trials. Joshua's obedience in destroying the horses and chariots, shows his self-denial in compliance with God's command. The possession of things on which the carnal heart is prone to depend, is hurtful to the life of faith, and the walk with God; therefore it is better to be without worldly advantages, than to have the soul endangered by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One portion of the defeated host fled north-westward toward Zidon; the other northeastward up the Ard el Huleh.<p>Zidon, as the metropolis of various subject towns and territories, appears <a href="/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a> to have been afterward assigned to Asher, but was not, in fact, conquered by that tribe <a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>.

The issue of every battle is in God's hands. The natural man attributes it to human skill. The spiritual man, whether under the law or under the gospel, acknowledges the truth that "there is no restraint to the Lord, to save by many or by few" (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>). But if victory should ever side with numbers, if God appears not to "defend the right," it is that anxiety and sorrow may chasten the hearts of its upholders, lead them to "crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts," and so conduct them to a final victory when they are fitted to resist the intoxication of prosperity. Many a lesson in history has taught us that immediate success is by no means a blessing, even to those who are in the main fighting for a good cause. <span class="cmt_word">Great Zidon.</span> So called, not to distinguish it from any other city, but to mark (so also <a href="/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>) its importance as the capital of Phoenicia. This expression, "great Zidon," marks the early date of the Book of Joshua. In Homer's Iliad, Sidon is represented as the great home of the arts, though the historian Justin tells us that, even when Homer wrote, her superiority had passed to Tyre (see II. 6:290, 23. 743; Odyssey 4:618, 13:285, 15:425. Homer speaks of it as "well peopled," famous for "much brass" and the like (see Kenrick's 'Phoenicia'). In later years, Tyre, known only to the Book of Joshua as "the strong (literally, 'fortified') city." Tyre (<a href="/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>) outstripped her rival, and from the time of David till that of Alexander the Great, in spite of her destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, retained her pre-eminence (see the vivid description of Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26, 27</a>.). Sidon, now called Saida, is still a commercial city of some importance, whereas Tyre is, or was, a few years ago, little better than a collection of huts. This is not difficult to explain. The pre-eminence of Tyre was due to her military strength in a time of warlike enterprise, that of Sidon to natural, position. "This ancient city of Phoenicia, 'the eldest born of Canaan'" (see <a href="/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>), "stood on the northwest slope of a small promontory which runs into the sea, and its original harbour was formed by three low ridges of rocks, with narrow openings between them parallel to the shore in front of the city. On these islands there are remains of massive substructions, the work of the ancient Phoenicians. There is a spacious but unprotected bay on the south of the promontory .... No traces of the ancient city can be seen on the mainland, but at a short distance to the north are sepulchral grottoes, which probably mark the necropolis." The plain of Sidon is prolonged as far as Sarepta, the Zarephath of the Old Testament, eight miles to the south, which stands on a rising ground near the sea, and shows the remains of ancient walls (Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' pp. 17, 18). <span class="cmt_word">Misrephoth Maim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">burnings of waters. Kimchi</span> conjectures that these were hot springs, whereas <span class="accented">Jarchi</span> more reasonably supposes them to have been salt pits, in which the water was evaporated and the salt left. <span class="accented">Masius</span>, whom most modern commentators follow, thinks that glass houses, of which there were several near Sidon ("constat enim eas apud Sidonem fuisse plurimas"), are meant. But it is difficult to translate the Hebrew with him and Gesenins, "burning <span class="accented">near</span> waters," and the idea of some that water stands here for glass is absurd. Knobel regards it as equivalent to water-heights, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, cliffs rising from the sea, and derives the word from an Arabic root, <span class="accented">saraph, to be</span> high. The LXX. renders it by a proper name. Symmachus, "from the sea," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>.

The word here, Bik'a, signifies an open, wide valley between mountains (see ver. 17).

The town of Dor, which was built by Phoenicians, who settled there on account of the abundance of the purple mussels (Steph. Byz. s. v. &#x394;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), was allotted to the Manassites in the territory of Asher (<a href="/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; cf. <a href="/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>), and taken possession of by the children of Joseph (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-29.htm">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>). It was situated on the Mediterranean Sea, below the promontory of Carmel, nine Roman miles north of Caesarea, and is at the present time a hamlet called Tantura or Tortura, with very considerable ruins (Wilson, The Holy Land, ii. 249, and V. de Velde, Journey, i. p. 251). The old town was a little more than a mile to the north, on a small range of hills, which is covered with ruins (Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 608-9; V. de Velde, Mem. p. 307), and on the north of which there are rocky ranges, with many grottos, and houses cut in the rock itself (Buckingham, Syria, i. pp. 101-2). These are "the heights of Dor," or "the high range of Dor" (<a href="/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>).</body></html>
