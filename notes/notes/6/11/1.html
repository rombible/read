God encouraged Joshua. Fresh dangers and difficulties make it necessary to seek fresh supports from the word of God, which we have nigh unto us for use in every time of need. God proportions our trials to our strength, and our strength to our trials. Joshua's obedience in destroying the horses and chariots, shows his self-denial in compliance with God's command. The possession of things on which the carnal heart is prone to depend, is hurtful to the life of faith, and the walk with God; therefore it is better to be without worldly advantages, than to have the soul endangered by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jabin - Probably the hereditary and official title of the kings of Hazor (see <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>).

It denotes “<span class="ital">the wise</span>” or “<span class="ital">intelligent</span>” Here we find a king of the same name at a considerably later date (<a href="/judges/4-2.htm" title="And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.">Jdg 4:2</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Hazor</span>]= “<span class="ital">enclosed</span>,” “<span class="ital">fortified</span>” was an important, and apparently almost impregnable, stronghold of the Canaanites of the north, situated in the mountains, north of the waters of Merom. We find it afterwards fortified by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1 Kings 9:15</a>), and its inhabitants were carried away captive by Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2 Kings 15:29</a>).

It has been identified with <span class="ital">Chaifa</span>, a place which, from its situation, must always have been of great importance.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass.</span> The political constitution of Palestine was, humanly speaking, the cause of its overthrow. The division of the country into a host of petty states, and the consequent want of cohesion and concert, made its conquest a comparatively easy task. Had the kings of the north rallied round the standard set up in Central Palestine by Adoni-zedek, a far more formidable opposition would have been offered to Joshua at Gibeon. Calvin takes us, however, at once to the fountain head, and remarks how God fitted the burden to those who had to bear it. In spite of the great things God had done to them, they might have been driven to despair (and every one knows how weak their faith was) by the overwhelming numbers of the enemy. But by reason of the slackness of their opponents they were able to meet and overcome them in detail, without any opposition but what their weak faith enabled them courageously to confront. <span class="cmt_word">Jabin king of Hazer.</span> Jabin (the Hebrew meaning of this word is <span class="accented">intelligent</span>) was, like Pharaoh in Egypt, the usual name for the king that reigned in Hazor (see <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2, 23, 24</a>). He was a powerful monarch, and if not before, at least after, the Israelitish invasion became the acknowledged head of the league formed among the Canaanites against the Israelites. The first mention we have of Hazor in history is before the Exodus. The temple at Karnak, in Egypt, contains an account of an expedition into Palestine by Thotmes III., in which Kedeshu, Magedi, Damesku, Khatzor or Hazara, and other places are mentioned. We may no doubt identify these with Kedesh-Naphtali, Megiddo, Damascus, and Hazor (see Palest. Expl. Quart. Paper, April, 1876). Hazor, like <span class="accented">fort</span> in French and German, <span class="accented">caer</span> in Welsh, and the termination <span class="accented">cester</span> in English (so also <span class="accented">chester</span>), signifies a castle or fortified town. Like the names above mentioned, it was by no means an uncommon name. Beside the present Hazer, which was in northern Palestine, two cities of that name are mentioned in the south (<a href="/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23, 25</a>). It rose from its ashes during the period of inaction which followed the death of Joshua, and though (ch. 19:36) it was assigned to the tribe of Naphtali, became once more the centre of a strong Canaanitish organisation. It was, perhaps, the city Solomon is stated to have fortified (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), though this is not expressly stated. This becomes more probable when we find this Hazer among the cities of northern Israel captured by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). "Yet still, in spite of the destruction by the Assyrians, the name lived on till the time of the Maccabees, and the great contest between King Demetrius and Jonathan the Maccabean took place upon the plain of Hazer" (Ritter, 2:225). Josephus also mentions the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span> in this connection. Robinson identifies it with Tel Khuraibeh, on the lake of Huleh, the ancient Merom. Conder regards it as represented by Jebel and Merj Hadireh, on the borders of this lake. Dean Stanley places it above the lake, while Vandevelde finds a place called Hazur, with extensive ruins, some distance westward. The names, however, Hazur and Haziri, are very common. Of Madon and Shimron nothing is known. Knobel would identify Achshaph with Aeco or Ptolemais. Robinson supposes it to be the modern Kesai. But this is not certain, for Aehshaph (ch. 19:25) formed the border of Asher, while Kesaf is in the extreme north. According to Conder, it is the present el Yasif. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joshua then turned southwards with all Israel (i.e., all the army), attacked Debir and took it, and the towns dependent upon it, in the same manner as those mentioned before.

It stood upon the mountains of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>), to the south of Hebron, but has not yet been certainly discovered, though V. de Velde is probably correct in his supposition that it is to be seen in the ruins of Dilbeh, on the peak of a hill to the north of Wady Dilbeh, and on the road from Dhoberiyeh to Hebron, about two hours to the south-west of the latter. For, according to Dr. Stewart, there is a spring at Dilbeh, the water of which is conducted by an aqueduct into the Birket el Dilbeh, at the foot of the said hill, which would answer very well to the upper and lower springs at Debir, if only Debir might be placed, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>, so far towards the north.<p>(Note: Knobel imagines that Debir is to be found in the modern village of Dhoberiyeh (Dhabarije), five hours to the south-west of Hebron, on the south-west border of the mountains of Judah, upon the top of a mountain, because, in addition to the situation of this village, which is perfectly reconcilable with <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>, there are remains of a square tower there (according to Krafft, a Roman tower), which point to an ancient fortification (vid., Rob. Pal. i. pp. 308ff.; Ritter, Erdk. xvi. pp. 202ff.), and because the name, which signifies "placed behind the back," agrees with Debir, the hinder part or back (?), and Kirjath-sepher, if interpreted by the Arabic words, which signify "extremitas, margo, ora." But both reasons prove very little. The meanings assigned to Debir and Kirjath-sepher are improbable and arbitrary. Moreover, it has not been shown that there are any springs near Dhoberiyeh, such as there were in the neighbourhood of Debir (<a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>.). The view held by Rosenmller, and adopted by Bunsen, with regard to the situation of Debir, - namely, that it was the same as the modern Idwirbn or Dewirbn, an hour and a quarter to the west of Hebron, because there is a large spring there with an abundant supply of excellent water, which goes by the name of Ain Nunkr, - is also quite untenable; for it is entirely at variance with <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>, according to which Debir was not on the west of Hebron, but upon the mountains to the south, and rests entirely upon the erroneous assumption that, according to <a href="/joshua/10-38.htm">Joshua 10:38</a> (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, he turned round), as Joshua came from Eglon, he conquered Hebron first, and after the conquest of this town turned back to Debir, to take it also. But &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, does not mean only to turn round or turn back: it signifies turning generally; and it is very evident that this is the sense in which it is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-38.htm">Joshua 10:38</a>, since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>, Debir was on the south of Hebron.)<p>Moreover, not very long afterwards, probably during the time when the Israelites were occupied with the subjugation of northern Canaan, Hebron and Debir were taken again by the Canaanites, particularly the Anakites, as Joshua had not entirely destroyed them, although he had thoroughly cleared the mountains of Judah of them, but had left them still in the towns of the Philistines (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-22</a>). Consequently, when the land was divided, there were Anakites living in both Hebron and Debir; so that Caleb, to whom these towns were given as his inheritance, had first of all to conquer them again, and to exterminate the Anakites (<a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-17</a> : cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm">Judges 1:10-13</a>).<p>(Note: By this simple assumption we get rid of the pretended contradictions, which neological critics have discovered between <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-36.htm">Joshua 10:36-39</a> on the one hand, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-22</a>, and <a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-17</a> on the other, and on account of which Knobel would assign the passages last named to a different document. On the first conquest of the land by Joshua, Masius observes that "in this expedition Joshua ran through the southern region with an armed band, in too hurried a manner to depopulate it entirely. All that he needed was to strike such terror into the hearts of all through his victories, that no one should henceforth offer any resistance to himself and to the people of God. Those whom he pursued, therefore, he destroyed according to the commands of God, not sparing a single one, but he did not search out every possible hiding-place in which any could be concealed. This was left as a gleaning to the valour of each particular tribe, when it should take possession of its own inheritance.")  </body></html>
