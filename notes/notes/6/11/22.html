The land rested from war. It ended not in a peace with the Canaanites, that was forbidden, but in a peace from them. There is a rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they shall enter, when their warfare is accomplished. That which was now done, is compared with what had been said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed together, will be found mutually to set each other forth. If we make conscience of our duty, we need not question the performance of the promise. But the believer must never put off his armour, or expect lasting peace, till he closes his eyes in death; nay, as his strength and usefulness increase, he may expect more heavy trials; yet the Lord will not permit any enemies to assault the believer till he has prepared him for the battle. Christ Jesus ever lives to plead for his people, and their faith shall not fail, however Satan may be permitted to assault them. And however tedious, sharp, and difficult the believer's warfare, his patience in tribulation may be encouraged by the joyfulness of hope; for he will, ere long, rest from sin and from sorrow in the Canaan above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gaza, Gath, Ashdod - See the <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. from the mount Halak&#8212;Hebrew, "the smooth mountain."<p>that goeth up to Seir&#8212;an irregular line of white naked hills, about eighty feet high, and seven or eight geographical miles in length that cross the whole Ghor, eight miles south of the Dead Sea, probably "the ascent of Akrabbim" [Robinson].<p>unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon&#8212;the city or temple of the god of destiny, in Baalbec.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Three cities of the Philistines, to which they retired, and where we find some of them afterwards, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm" title="And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.">1 Samuel 17:4</a> <a href="/2_samuel/21-16.htm" title="And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.">2 Samuel 21:16</a></span>; which may be one reason why the Israelites durst not make an attempt upon these places, though they were a part of their possession. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel,....

It was assigned to the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm" title="Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, to the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof:">Joshua 15:47</a>), but was never subdued by the Israelites, and even down to Nehemiahâ€™s age it preserved its distinctiveness of race and language (<a href="/context/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:...">Nehemiah 13:23-24</a>).

But it had almost died out. Goliath and his brethren seem to have been regarded by the Philistines, as much as by the Hebrews, in the light of prodigies. It may be that the race deteriorated in size and strength, when driven from the mountain district. Gaza (Hebrew Azzah, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>) was a stronghold of the Philistines. We first find it mentioned as the border of Canaan in <a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>. It was the scene of the exploits of Samson, related in <a href="/judges/16.htm">Judges 16</a>. It, with Gath, Ekron, Ashdod, and Ashkelon, formed the five Philistine lordships mentioned in <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>. Gaza does not appear in the list of cities captured by David, although Gath does. Perhaps the strength of its position (Azzah signifies strength) may have enabled it to resist David and Solomon, whose dominions are said to have extended to, but not to have included, Azzah. We read little more of it in the Old Testament. Jeremiah says that Pharaoh smote it (Joshua 47:1); Amos and Zephaniah threatened it with punishment. It is mentioned in <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a> as a place of some importance. And it still exists, at about an hour's journey from the sea, and is now called Ghazzeh. (see also note on ver. 41). Gath. Also one of the five Philistine lordships. In David's time it had a king, with whom David took refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). It was afterwards conquered by David (<a href="/2_samuel/21-20.htm">2 Samuel 21:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a>). We find it in Solomon's jurisdiction, though under the government of one of its own royal family (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>). Rehoboam fortified it (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). Hazael, the powerful king of Syria, wrested it from Jehoash, and was only bought air from assailing Jerusalem. Uzziah retook it once more (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). Hezekiah seems to have retained it (<a href="/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>). After this we hear no more of it. Modern travellers and commentators have identified it with Beit-Jibrin (the house of the mighty - perhaps a reminiscence of Goliath and his kindred), now Eleutheropolis (so Knobel). Others suppose it to be the Blanche Garde of the Crusaders, or Tell-es-Safieh, an opinion supported, among others, by Mr. J. L. Porter and Lieut. Conder. See, however, the note on Libnah, <a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>. Ashdod. Later Azotus, now Esdud. Here the ark was carried after the disastrous defeat related in <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>. It was conquered by Uzziah (no doubt it had formerly been reduced by David), who built forts to overawe it (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), but it fell into the hands of Sargon, king of Assyria, a little later (<a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>). It is frequently mentioned by the prophets, and we find that Jonathan, the brother of Judas Maceabaeus, burnt the temple of Dagon there (1 Macc. 10:83, 84). It is mentioned as Azotus in <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/joshua/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Retrospective View of the Conquest of the Whole Land. - <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a>, <a href="/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>. Joshua took all this land, namely, those portions of Southern Canaan that have already been mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40-41</a>; also the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and its lowlands (see <a href="/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>), i.e., the northern part of the land (in the campaign described in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-15</a>), that is to say, Canaan in all its extent, "from the bald mountain which goeth up to Seir" in the south, "to Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon under Hermon." The "bald mountain" (Halak), which is mentioned here and in <a href="/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a> as the southern boundary of Canaan, is hardly the row of white cliffs which stretches obliquely across the Arabah eight miles below the Dead Sea and forms the dividing line that separates this valley into el-Ghor and el-Araba (Rob. Pal. ii. pp. 489, 492), or the present Madara, a strange-looking chalk-hill to the south-west of the pass of Sufah (Rob. ii. p. 589), a steep bare mountain in a barren plain, the sides of which consist of stone and earth of a leaden ashy hue (Seetzen, R. iii. pp. 14, 15); but in all probability the northern edge of the Azazimeh mountain with its white and glistening masses of chalk. Baal-gad, i.e., the place or town of Baal, who was there worshipped as Gad (see <a href="/isaiah/65-11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a>), also called Baal-hermon in <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a>, is not Baalbek, but the Paneas or Caesarea Philippi of a later time, the present Banjas (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8-9</a>). This is the opinion of v. Raumer and Robinson, though Van de Velde is more disposed to look for Baal-gad in the ruins of Kalath (the castle of) Bostra, or of Kalath Aisafa, the former an hour and a half, the latter three hours to the north of Banjas, the situation of which would accord with the biblical statements respecting Baal-gad exceedingly well. The "valley of Lebanon" is not Coele-Syria, the modern Beka, between Lebanon and Antilibanus, but the valley at the foot of the southern slope of Jebel Sheik (Hermon). </body></html>
