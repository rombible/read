Thus the war against Satan's kingdom, carried on by preaching the gospel, was at first forwarded by miracles; but being fully proved to be of God, we are now left to the Divine grace in the usual course, in the use of the sword of the Spirit. God encouraged Joshua. Fresh dangers and difficulties make it necessary to seek fresh supports from the word of God, which we have nigh unto us for use in every time of need. God proportions our trials to our strength, and our strength to our trials. Joshua's obedience in destroying the horses and chariots, shows his self-denial in compliance with God's command. The possession of things on which the carnal heart is prone to depend, is hurtful to the life of faith, and the walk with God; therefore it is better to be without worldly advantages, than to have the soul endangered by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joshua/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Suddenly - As before, at Gibeon <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-9.htm">Joshua 10:9</a>, so now Joshua anticipates his enemies. Taken by surprise, and hemmed in between the mountains and the lake, the chariots and horses would have no time to deploy and no room to act effectively; and thus, in all probability, the unwieldy host of the Canaanites fell at once into hopeless confusion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joshua/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. to-morrow, about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel&#8212;As it was impossible to have marched from Gilgal to Merom in one day, we must suppose Joshua already moving northward and within a day's distance of the Canaanite camp, when the Lord gave him this assurance of success. With characteristic energy he made a sudden advance, probably during the night, and fell upon them like a thunderbolt, when scattered along the rising grounds (Septuagint), before they had time to rally on the plain. In the sudden panic "the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them." The rout was complete; some went westward, over the mountains, above the gorge of the Leontes, to Sidon and Misrephothmaim ("glass-smelting houses"), in the neighborhood, and others eastward to the plain of Mizpeh.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joshua/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When they least expected them, intending there to refresh, and prepare, and order themselves for the offensive war which they designed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joshua/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them,....

On receiving intelligence of what had occurred in the south, the king of Hazor formed an alliance with the kings of Madon, Shimron, and Achshaph, and other kings of the north, to make a common attack upon the Israelites. This league originated with Jabin the king of Hazor, because Hazor was formerly the head of all the kingdoms of northern Canaan (<a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). Hazor, which Joshua conquered and burned to the ground (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>, <a href="/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11</a>), was afterwards restored, and became a capital again (<a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-9.htm">1 Samuel 12:9</a>); it was fortified by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), and taken by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). It belonged to the tribe of Naphtali (<a href="/joshua/19-36.htm">Joshua 19:36</a>), but has not yet been discovered. According to Josephus (Ant. v. 5, 1), it was above the Lake of Samochonitis, the present Bahr el Huleh. Robinson conjectures that it is to be found in the ruins upon Tell Khuraibeh, opposite to the north-west corner of the lake of Huleh, the situation of which would suit Hazor quite well, as it is placed between Ramah and Kedesh in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35-36</a> (see Bibl. Res. p. 364). On the other hand, the present ruins of Huzzur or Hazireh, where there are the remains of large buildings of a very remote antiquity (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 62), with which Knobel identifies Hazor, cannot be thought of for a moment, as these ruins, which are about an hour and a quarter to the south-west of Yathir, are so close to the Ramah of Asher (<a href="/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>) that Hazor must also have belonged to Asher, and could not possibly have been included in the territory of Naphtali. There would be more reason for thinking of Tell Hazr or Khirbet Hazr, on the south-west of Szafed (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 81); but these ruins are not very ancient, and only belong to an ordinary village, and not to a town at all. Madon is only mentioned again in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/12-19.htm">Joshua 12:19</a>, and its situation is quite unknown. Shimron, called Shimron-meron in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/12-20.htm">Joshua 12:20</a>, was allotted to the tribe of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>), and is also unknown. For Meron cannot be connected, as Knobel supposes, with the village and ruins of Marn, not far from Kedesh, on the south-west (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 371), or Shimron with the ruins of Khuraibeh, an hour to the south of Kedesh; as the territory of Zebulun, to which Shimron belonged, did not reach so far north, and there is not the slightest ground for assuming that there were two Shimrons, or for making a distinction between the royal seat mentioned here and the Shimron of Zebulun. There is also no probability in Knobel's conjecture, that the Shimron last named is the same as the small village of Semunieh, probably the Simonias of Josephus (Vita, 24), on the west of Nazareth (see Rob. Pal. iii. p. 201). Achshaph, a border town of Ashwer (<a href="/joshua/19-25.htm">Joshua 19:25</a>), is also unknown, and is neither to be sought, as Robinson supposes (Bibl. Res. pp. 55), in the ruins of Kesf, which lie even farther north than Abel (Abil), in the tribe of Naphtali, and therefore much too far to the north to have formed the boundary of Asher; nor to be identified with Acco (Ptolemais), as Knobel imagines, since Acco has nothing in common with Achshaph except the letter caph (see also at <a href="/joshua/19-25.htm">Joshua 19:25</a>).</body></html>
