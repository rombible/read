What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There were two grounds, and two only, on which Hezekiah could rest his refusal to surrender,<p>(1) ability to resist by his own natural military strength and that of his allies; and<p>(2) expectation based upon the language of Isaiah Isa 30:31; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-9</a>, of supernatural assistance from Yahweh.<p>The Rab-shakeh argues that both grounds of confidence are equally fallacious. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. that they may eat, &c.&#8212;This was designed to show the dreadful extremities to which, in the threatened siege, the people of Jerusalem would be reduced.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem,....

There were but two grounds that Hezekiah could possibly put forward: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> deliverance by human means - by his own armed strength and that of his allies; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> deliverance by supernatural means - by some great manifestation of miraculous power on the part of Jehovah. Rabshakeh thinks both equally impossible. The first, however, is too absurd for argument, and he therefore takes no further notice of it; but the second he proceeds to combat, in vers. 33-35. <span class="cmt_word">For he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.</span> Correct grammar requires "out of my hand;" but Rabshakeh forgets that he is professing to report the words of Sennacherib. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Still less could Hezekiah rely upon his military resources. &#1504;&#1488; &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;: enter, I pray thee, (into contest) with my lord, and I will give thee 2000 horses, if thou canst set the horsemen upon them.
