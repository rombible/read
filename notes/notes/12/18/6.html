Some others did that which was right, but not like David. Let us not suppose that when times and men are bad, they must needs grow worse and worse; that does not follow: after many bad kings, God raised one up like David himself. The brazen serpent had been carefully preserved, as a memorial of God's goodness to their fathers in the wilderness; but it was idle and wicked to burn incense to it. All helps to devotion, not warranted by the word of God, interrupt the exercise of faith; they always lead to superstition and other dangerous evils. Human nature perverts every thing of this kind. True faith needs not such aids; the word of God, daily thought upon and prayed over, is all the outward help we need.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Other good kings, as Solomon, Jehoshaphat, Joash, and Amaziah, had fallen away in their later years.

In the petty kingdom of Judah, Josiah alone had a similar testimony borne to him (2Ki 23:25). But even he was surpassed by Hezekiah, who set about a national reformation at the beginning of his reign, which Josiah did not. The pious character and the excellent course of Hezekiah was prompted, among other secondary influences, by a sense of the calamities his father's wicked career had brought on the country, as well as by the counsels of Isaiah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Departed not from following him, </span> in the general course of his life and especially in the matters of God’s worship. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he clave to the Lord,....
