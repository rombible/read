What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An interval of time must be placed between this verse and the last.

It was under these circumstances that Sennacherib appears to have made his second expedition into Palestine very soon after the first. Following the usual coast route he passed through Philistia on his way to Egypt, leaving Jerusalem on one side, despising so irony a state, and knowing that the submission of Egypt would involve that of her hangers-on. While, however, he was besieging Lachish on his way to encounter his main enemy, he determined to try the temper of the Jews by means of an embassy, which he accordingly sent.<p>Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh - None of these are proper names.

We can imagine many things which induced Sennacherib not to keep faith with Hezekiah, but most probably it was the movements of the Egyptians in the south. Finding that they were advancing he would resolve on attacking and reducing Jerusalem before they arrived, and would care nothing for former compacts. <span class="ital">Tartan,</span> as well as the other two names here given, is probably an official title. Tartan is found in <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>, and the R.V. puts a note in the margin ‘the title of the Assyrian commander in chief’. In that place it is the title of the officer sent by Sargon against Ashdod. As this title here stands first, we may suppose that he was the chief military officer, though Rab-shakeh was the spokesman. It would be more correct to say ‘the Tartan’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Rabsaris</span>] The word is Hebrew in form and signifies ‘the chief of the eunuchs’. It may be some title which the Jews modified so as to make of it a Hebrew word. Clearly in this place it indicates some high official. It need not necessarily be a military person, but some one like a lord chamberlain, who came with the Tartan to add civil dignity to the military. Rab-saris is found in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>) among the titles of the princes of the king of Babylon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Rab-shakeh</span>] This word also has a Hebrew form, and means ‘the chief cup-bearer’. The title may have been preserved and attached to an office, when the duties from which it was originally given had ceased to be performed, and others had been imposed in their place. And the Hebrew writers may have represented in their own way the meaning of a title for which they had no proper equivalent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with a great host</span>] For Jerusalem was stronger than the other places in Judah which he had already captured, and news from Egypt-wards was perhaps such as to make haste urgent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>against <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">unto Jerusalem</span>. The original has no preposition, but the accusative of direction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they came and stood by the conduit</span>] The Chronicler gives us details which shew that some time elapsed before the attack on Jerusalem was commenced. Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem. He therefore took counsel with his princes and blocked up all the water courses and fountains, so that the Assyrians should have as little water supply as possible. He also strengthened the fortifications, provided new weapons, and organized his forces. Then he gathered the people and encouraged them, so that they ‘rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah’. All this had been done before the arrival of Rab-shakeh and his fellows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the upper pool</span>] This is probably what in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-30.htm" title="This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.">2 Chronicles 32:30</a> is called ‘the upper watercourse of Gihon’. On ‘Gihon’ see note on <a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm" title="The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:">1 Kings 1:33</a>. The locality is described, in the same words as here, in <a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;">Isaiah 7:3</a>, so that it was a well-known spot.

The subject is one throughout, viz. Sennacherib's second expedition against Hezekiah. The narrative flows on without a break. It consists of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> an account of the embassy of Rabshakeh (<a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17-37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1-8</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> an account of an insulting letter written by Sennacherib to Hezekiah, and of Hezekiah's "spreading it before the Lord" (<a href="/2_kings/19-9.htm">2 Kings 19:9-14</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the prayer of Hezekiah, and God's answer to it by the mouth of Isaiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15-34</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the destruction of Sennacherib's host, his flight to Nineveh, and his murder by two of his sons. The Assyrian inscriptions are absolutely silent with respect to this expedition and its result - it being a fixed rule with the historiographers of Assyria to pass over without notice all defeats and disasters. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem.</span> Sennacherib appears, by his great inscription, to have returned to Nineveh, with his Judaean captives (more than two hundred thousand in number) and his rich booty, towards the close of the year  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. In the following year he was called into Babylonia, where troubles had broken out, and Hezekiah, left to himself, seems to have made up his mind to revolt, and <span class="accented">to</span> have called in the assistance of Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). Sabatok was probably the nominal sovereign, but Tirhakah, who held his court at Meres, was lord paramount. An alliance was made; and hopes held out that, if Sennacherib again marched into Judaea, Hezekiah would receive effectual aid, especially in chariots and horsemen (ver. 24). Under these circumstances, Sennacherib made his second expedition, probably in  <span class="date">B.C. 699</span>. Regarding Egypt as his main enemy, and Judaea as of small account, he led his army by the ordinary route into the Philistian plain, pressing southward, while he detached a moderato force to hold Jerusalem in check, to threaten it, and, if an opportunity offered, to seize it. At the head of this force were three commanders, who seem to have borne, all of them, official titles; viz. the Tartan, or "commander-in-chief;" the Rabsaris, or "chief eunuch;" and the Rabshakeh, or "chief cupbearer." The Tartan was the highest of all the officials of the empire, and ranked next to the king. Sennacherib detached this force from Lachish, which seems to have revolted, and to have been undergoing a second siege. <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool.</span> It was, perhaps, this army which Isaiah saw in vision, advancing on Jerusalem from the pass of Michmash (<a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28-32</a>), and "shaking its hand" at the city from the northern plateau outside the walls - the traditional "camp of the Assyrians." At any rate, the "upper pool" and the" fuller's field" were in this direction (see the comment on Isaiah 7:3). <span class="cmt_word">Which is in the highway of the fuller's field.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9-12</a> the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes by Salmanasar, which has already been related according to the annals of the kingdom of Israel in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>, is related once more according to the annals of the kingdom of Judah, in which this catastrophe is also introduced as an event that was memorable in relation to all the covenant-nation. </body></html>
