What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Syrian language - i. e., Aramaic; probably the dialect of Damascus, a Semitic language nearly akin to their own, but suffciently different to be unintelligible to ordinary Jews<p>The people that are on the wall - The conference must have been held immediately outside the wall for the words of the speakers to have been audible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

The court officials would of necessity have to speak it for the purposes of political intercourse. ‘Syriac’ is a later dialect of Aramæan. For ‘talk not’ R.V. has <span class="bld">speak not</span>. The original word is the same as in the previous clause. By their request Eliakim and his companions at once put themselves at Rabshakeh’s mercy, and he shewed them none. ‘Lewd men are the worse for admonitions. Rab-shakeh had not so strained his throat to corrupt the citizens of Jerusalem, had it not been for the humble obtestation of Eliakim. Now he rears up his voice and holds up his sides, and roars out his double blasphemies’ (Bp Hall).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the people that</span> are <span class="ital">on the wall</span>] There had gathered a crowd around Hezekiah’s ministers to hear the issue of the conference, and these from their previous sufferings in the siege would be ready enough to put a favourable construction on Rab-shakeh’s argument. The Chronicler (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-11.htm" title="Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?">2 Chronicles 32:11</a>) represents him as employing the powerful argument to starving men ‘Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst’? This is the fearful extremity which is so coarsely alluded to in the words of the next verse. That such food had been used by persons reduced to extremity in a siege, see above chap. <a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm" title="And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.">2 Kings 6:25</a> and the note there.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the Aramaic language</span>. Hebrew, Aramaic, and Assyrian were three cognate languages, closely allied, and very similar both in their grammatical forms and in their vocabularies, but still sufficiently different to be distinct languages, which were only intelligible to those who had learnt them. Rabshakeh had addressed the Jewish officials in Hebrew, probably as the language which they would best understand, if it were not even the only one that they would understand; not with the express "object of influencing the common people," as Bahr supposes. But the Jewish officials feared that the words uttered were influencing them. They proposed, therefore, that the further negotiations should be conducted in Aramaic, a tongue which they understood, and one which they supposed that Rabshakeh, as he knew Hebrew, would also know. Aramaic was spoken in most of the tract that lay between Assyria and Palestine, in Syria and Damascus certainly, in Upper Mesopotamia, along the line of the Euphrates, and perhaps as far as the Khabour river. <span class="cmt_word">For we understand it.</span> It is not likely that the Jews of this time generally understood Aramaic; but high officials of the court, who might have to deal with embassies and negotiate treaties, found it necessary to understand it, just as such persons in our own country have to know French. <span class="cmt_word">And talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</span> Besides the sentinels and other soldiers, there would probably be many idlers upon the wall, attracted by the unwonted spectacle of an ambassadorial <span class="accented">cortege</span>, and anxious to pick up intelligence.
