If Rab-shakeh could speak Hebrew, he would almost certainly know the name of the god of the Jews; and it was perfectly natural for him to assume that Hezekiah and his prophets would encourage the people to trust in the God who had His sanctuary on Zion, and was bound to defend His own dwelling-place.

What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There were two grounds, and two only, on which Hezekiah could rest his refusal to surrender,<p>(1) ability to resist by his own natural military strength and that of his allies; and<p>(2) expectation based upon the language of Isaiah Isa 30:31; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-9</a>, of supernatural assistance from Yahweh.<p>The Rab-shakeh argues that both grounds of confidence are equally fallacious. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. that they may eat, &c.&#8212;This was designed to show the dreadful extremities to which, in the threatened siege, the people of Jerusalem would be reduced.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem,....

If at one time he had trusted in Egypt, that trust was now quite or well-nigh gone. The tone of his exhortations was that recorded in Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6-8</a>), "He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the King of Assyria, nor for all the multi-rude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him [see <a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16</a>]; with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah King of Judah." <span class="cmt_word">Saying, The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria</span>. Hezekiah's was, in part, a general conviction that God would not forsake his people, who had recently turned to him, if not with absolute sincerity, yet at any rate with public confession of sin, and public acknowledgment of his mercies, and public profession of an intention to serve him; in part, probably, a special reliance on some definite prophecies of Isaiah, that the city should not be taken (see <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-6</a>; Isaiah 34:20-22). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Still less could Hezekiah rely upon his military resources. &#1504;&#1488; &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;: enter, I pray thee, (into contest) with my lord, and I will give thee 2000 horses, if thou canst set the horsemen upon them. The meaning, of course, is not that Hezekiah could not raise 2000 soldiers in all, but that he could not produce so many men who were able to fight as horsemen.
