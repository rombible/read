What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in seeking peace with God. It is, therefore, our wisdom to yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what confidence is that which those trust in who stand out against him? A great deal of art there is in this speech of Rabshakeh; but a great deal of pride, malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. Hezekiah's nobles held their peace. There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak; and there are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational, is to cast pearls before swine. Their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure. It is often best to leave such persons to rail and blaspheme; a decided expression of abhorrence is the best testimony against them. The matter must be left to the Lord, who has all hearts in his hands, committing ourselves unto him in humble submission, believing hope, and fervent prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make an agreement ... - Rather, "Make peace with me."

The noun is that which is often rendered ‘blessing’ in the sense of a ‘present’ (see note on <a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2 Kings 5:15</a> above). And there is no example in the Bible exactly parallel to this. But the cognate verb is used of salutations (e.g. <a href="/2_kings/4-29.htm" title="Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.">2 Kings 4:29</a>), ‘If any man <span class="ital">salute</span> thee’, literally ‘bless thee’, ‘wish thee peace’. Hence it is not difficult to see how such a noun would come to have the sense of ‘peace’, exactly like <span class="ital">shalôm</span>, which is the more usual word in such salutations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and come out to me</span>] i.e. Open your gates and submit yourselves instead of staying within to die of starvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> then [R.V. omits then] <span class="ital">eat ye every man</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">one</span>] <span class="ital">of his own vine</span>] Cf. above <a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm" title="And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.">1 Kings 4:25</a> where the description applies to the most prosperous days of the reign of Solomon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cistern</span>] This was a pit or well dug for collecting water, not the sort of manufactured tank to which the name is now usually given.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the King of Assyria.</span> Rabshakeh, before concluding, tries the effect of blandishments. The King of Assyria is no harsh lord, as he has been represented to them. He will be a kinder master than Hezekiah. Hezekiah condemns them to all the hardships of a siege; and then, if they survive it, to a wasted land, ruined homes, broken cisterns. Sennacherib, if they will but yield to him, promises them peace and prosperity, a time of quiet enjoyment in their own land, and then removal to another equally good, where they will "live and not die," be happy and not miserable. It will be observed that none but material inducements are held out to them. They are expected to barter freedom, independence, religious privileges, country, home, for the sake of creature comforts - for ease, quiet, and security. Setting aside the question whether they could count on the performance of the promises made them, it will be felt that they did well not to be tempted. Better vigorous national life, with any amount of hardship, struggle, and suffering, than the gilded chains of the most peaceful servitude. <span class="cmt_word">Make an agreement with me by a present</span> - rather, <span class="accented">make peace with me</span>, or "make <span class="accented">terms</span> with me" (Knobel, Thenius, Keil, Bahr); in other words, give in your submission - <span class="cmt_word">and come out to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quit the town, surrender it (see <a href="/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>), place yourselves at my mercy, "and then" see what great things I will do for you." The tone, as Bahr says, is one of "wheedling" and cajolement. <span class="cmt_word">And then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree.</span> Proverbial expressions for a peaceful, happy time (see <a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>; <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>), when there are no inroads, no ravages, no disturbances. Rabshakeh promises, in the name of Sennacherib, that they shall rest in their own land for a term - an indefinite term - in a blissful state of peace and quietness before any new resolution is taken about them. <span class="cmt_word">And drink ye every one the waters of his cistern</span>; rather, of <span class="accented">his</span> well (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>). Every man who had a field or a vineyard was sure to have a well in it. Cisterns for the storage of rain-water were comparatively uncommon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Rabshakeh had thus, as he imagined, taken away every ground of confidence from Hezekiah, he added still further, that the Assyrian king himself had also not come without Jehovah, but had been summoned by Him to effect the destruction of Judah. It is possible that some report may have reached his ears of the predictions of the prophets, who had represented the Assyrian invasion as a judgment from the Lord, and these he used for his own purposes.
