It was very close to Askelon, which is mentioned in the inscriptions as one of the places against which Sennacherib’s expedition was specially directed. It is stated (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-9.htm" title="After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,">2 Chronicles 32:9</a>) that at this time Sennacherib besieged Lachish with all his power. So that it must have been a stronghold of some importance and perhaps a place likely to be of advantage in checking the approach of forces from Egypt, which were sure to be invited by those whom the Assyrians were attacking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I have offended</span>] It seems most natural to gather from this that Hezekiah had begun his movement for rebellion without any provocation from Assyria. The compact between Ahaz and Tiglath-pileser he would no doubt find galling, but his confession of a fault shews that he had attempted to withdraw his homage merely because he thought himself strong enough to do so. ‘What, do we mince that fact which holy Hezekiah himself censures?… The comfort of liberty may not be had with an unwarranted violence. Holiness cannot free us from infirmity. It was a weakness to do that act which must be soon undone, with much repentance and more loss’ (Bp Hall).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">three hundred talents of silver</span>] On the value of the talent of silver and of gold, see on <a href="/2_kings/5-5.htm" title="And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.">2 Kings 5:5</a>. The amount exacted on this occasion is not so great as that taken by Pul from Menahem, which was a thousand talents of silver. But in the previous reign Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-8.htm" title="And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.">2 Kings 16:8</a>) had paid large sums to Assyria, so that Judah must at this time have been drained of resources, and even the king of Assyria could not have what was not there.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah King of Judah sent to the King of Assyria to Lachish, saying.</span> (On the position of Lachish, see the comment upon <a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>.) A bas-relief in the British Museum is thought to represent Sennacherib at the siege of Lachish. He is seated on a highly ornamented throne, and is engaged in receiving prisoners. The city is represented as strongly fortified, and as attacked with sealing-ladders and battering-rams. The surrender is taking place, and the captives of importance are being conducted from one of the tower-gates to the presence of the conqueror. An accompanying inscription is to the following effect: "Sennacherib, the great king, the King of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lakhisha (Lachish). I give permission for its destruction." It would seem that while Sennacherib was personally engaged in this siege, a portion of his army had invested Jerusalem, and were pressing the siege (see <a href="/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have offended; return from me.</span> The tone of the submission is abject. In vain had Isaiah counseled resistance, and promised deliverance if trust were placed in God (<a href="/isaiah/8-9.htm">Isaiah 8:9-15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24-26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24, 25</a>). When the siege commenced, all was dismay within the walls - it was "a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity (<a href="/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>). Some of the rulers fled (<a href="/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>); others gave themselves up for lost, and resolved on "a short life and a merry one" (<a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). Hezekiah found no encouragement to resist in any of his counselors except Isaiah, and was therefore driven to despair - acknowledged himself in the wrong for rebelling, and besought Sennacherib to "return from him" - <span class="accented">i.e. in</span> retire and withdraw his troops. <span class="cmt_word">That which thou puttest on me will I bear.</span> Whatever burden Sennacherib chooses to put upon him, Hezekiah says he will bear, be it tribute, be it cession of territory, be it indignity of any sort or kind. He makes no reservation; but of course he assumes that the terms about to be offered him will be such as, according in the usages of war at the time, would be regarded as reasonable. <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah King of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span> Sennacherib says that the payment made him by Hezekiah was thirty talents of gold and <span class="accented">eight</span> hundred talents of silver ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 39, line 34). He has, perhaps, exaggerated, or he may have counted in all the silver that he carried off from the whole of Judaea; or, possibly, the payment to purchase peace was eight hundred talents, the fixed tribute three hundred. We learn from Sennacherib's inscription that, besides making this money payment, Hezekiah had to consent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a cession of territory towards the south-west, which was apportioned between Gaza, Ekron, and Ash-deal; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the surrender of an Assyrian vassal king, detained in Jerusalem; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the contribution to the harem at Nineveh of two if not more of his daughters. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hezekiah smote the Philistines to Gaza, and their territory from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city, i.e., all the towns from the least to the greatest (see at <a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9</a>). He thus chastised these enemies for their invasion of Judah in the time of Ahaz, wrested from them the cities which they had taken at that time (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>), and laid waste all their country to Gaza, i.e., Ghuzzeh, the most southerly of the chief cities of Philistia (see at <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>). This probably took place after the defeat of Sennacherib (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-22.htm">2 Chronicles 32:22-23</a>). </body></html>
