It signifies, to <span class="ital">inflict </span>a curse; and in this sense God is said to have <span class="ital">cursed </span>the ground after the fall. It signifies, to <span class="ital">wish </span>a curse; and in this sense Shimei is said to have <span class="ital">cursed </span>David. Lastly, it signifies, to <span class="ital">pronounce, </span>or <span class="ital">foretel, </span>a curse or punishment; and in this sense Elisha is said to have cursed the children. The historian expressly asserts, that he cursed them <span class="ital">in the name of the Lord. </span>To speak <span class="ital">in the name of the Lord, </span>is to deliver what he commands; <span class="ital">to prophesy in the name of the Lord, </span>is to foretel what he reveals; and <span class="ital">to curse in the name of the Lord, </span>is to declare a curse which he is determined to inflict, and has authorized the prophet to denounce: so that in cursing these supposed <span class="ital">children, </span>Elisha acted as a minister of the Supreme Ruler of the world, and by his order foretold the punishment that was going to be inflicted upon these idolaters. His pronouncing this curse was not the cause of their catastrophe; but the certainty of their catastrophe, and the command of God, were the causes of his pronouncing this curse.” See Dr. Dodd, and Morris, vol. 1. ser. 7.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">There came forth two she-bears out of the wood </span>— Which probably had been robbed of their whelps, and thereby made more fierce and outrageous; <span class="ital">and tare forty and two children of them — </span>Here the word translated <span class="ital">children </span>is different from that used above, namely, <span class="greekheb">ילדים</span>, <span class="ital">jeladim; </span>but this also signifies, not only young children, but also those that are grown up to maturity, as <a href="/genesis/32-22.htm" title="And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.">Genesis 32:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-4.htm" title="And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.">Genesis 34:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-30.htm" title="And he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?">Genesis 37:30</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-5.htm" title="And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.">Ruth 1:5</a>. In this extraordinary punishment, inflicted evidently by the hand of God on these young persons, we have demonstration, that the curse which the prophet denounced against them was not owing, as some have supposed, to the peevishness of his temper, or the ebullition of his anger: for though his rage had been ever so furious, it would not have supplied him with power to command these savage creatures to leave the woods at an instant, and to come to a place they did not frequent, as a public road must be supposed to be, in order to destroy these insolent youths. As his curse would have had no effect had it proceeded from a peevish temper, or from the violence of his passion, we have no just cause, from his cursing them, to suspect that he was actuated by any such principle. No: it was <span class="ital">in the name of the Lord; </span>not from any revengeful passion, but by the motion of God’s Spirit, and by God’s command and commission that he denounced the curse: and God caused the punishment to follow, partly to show his displeasure at such profaneness and malignity of mind against God, and his cause, and worship, as these youths were guilty of, for the terror and caution of all other ungodly persons, who abounded in that place; partly to vindicate the honour and maintain the authority of his prophets; and particularly of Elisha, now especially in the beginning of his sacred ministry; and partly to convince the people of the heinousness of idolatry, and to recover them to that purity of worship which the law was peculiarly intended to preserve.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Upon the whole, it appears that the persons who mocked Elijah were not infants, but arrived to years of maturity; that they did not insult him by chance, but by design; that they went out in great crowds on purpose; that they mocked him because he was the prophet of the true God, from whom they had apostatized; and that he did not wish their untimely end from a principle of revenge, but only predicted it as a prophet. The punishment will appear just, if we consider the time, place, persons, and all the circumstances of the case. These young persons might be guilty of many other heinous crimes, known to God and his prophet, besides that here recorded: they were at least guilty of idolatry, which by God’s law deserved death: add to this, that the idolatrous parents were punished in their children; and that if any of these children were more innocent, God might have mercy on their souls, and then the death they suffered was not a misery, but a real blessing to them, taking them away from that education which was very likely to expose them, not only to temporal, but eternal destruction. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19-25 Observe the miracle of healing the waters. Prophets should make every place to which they come better for them, endeavouring to sweeten bitter spirits, and to make barren souls fruitful, by the word of God, which is like the salt cast into the water by Elisha. It was an apt emblem of the effect produced by the grace of God on the sinful heart of man. Whole families, towns, and cities, sometimes have a new appearance through the preaching of the gospel; wickedness and evil have been changed into fruitfulness in the works of righteousness, which are, through Christ, to the praise and glory of God. Here is a curse on the youths of Bethel, enough to destroy them; it was not a curse causeless, for it was Elisha's character, as God's prophet, that they abused. They bade him go up, reflecting on the taking up of Elijah into heaven. The prophet acted by Divine impulse. If the Holy Spirit had not directed Elisha's solemn curse, the providence of God would not have followed it with judgment. The Lord must be glorified as a righteous God who hates sin, and will reckon for it. Let young persons be afraid of speaking wicked words, for God notices what they say. Let them not mock at any for defects in mind or body; especially it is at their peril, if they scoff at any for well doing. Let parents that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. And what will be the anguish of those parents, at the day of judgment, who witness the everlasting condemnation of their offspring, occasioned by their own bad example, carelessness, or wicked teaching!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On this occasion only do we find Elisha a minister of vengeance.

Under the Law God's ministers were required to curse the disobedient (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14-26</a>). Elisha could not tell what would be the effect of his curse.

But the punishment, whatever its severity, came from God, not from the prophet, and we may be sure was just. For "shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" A severe example may have been needed under the circumstances of the time, when a new generation was growing up in contempt of God and of religion; and the sin of the lads was not a small one, but indicated that determined bent of the will against good, and preference of evil, which is often developed early, and generally goes on from bad to worse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the disciples of the prophets at Jericho were so unable to realize the fact of Elijah's translation, although it had been previously revealed to them, that they begged permission of Elisha to send out fifty brave men to seek for Elijah. &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;: whether the Spirit of the Lord has not taken him and cast him upon one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys. &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; with the perfect is used "where there is fear of a fact, which as is conjectured almost with certainty has already happened," like &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; in the sense of "whether not" (vid., Ewald, 337, b.). &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is not a wind sent by Jehovah (Ges.), but the Spirit of Jehovah, as in <a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>. The Chethb &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is the regular formation from &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; or &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; (<a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>); the Keri with the transposition of &#1488; and ,&#1497; the later form: &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/ezekiel/7-16.htm">Ezekiel 7:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>, etc. The belief expressed by the disciples of the prophets, that Elijah might have been miraculously carried away, was a popular belief, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>, which the disciples of the prophets were probably led to share, more especially in the present case, by the fact that they could not imagine a translation to heaven as a possible thing, and with the indefiniteness of the expression &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; could only understand the divine revelation which they had received as referring to removal by death. So that even if Elisha told them how miraculously Elijah had been taken from him, which he no doubt did, they might still believe that by the appearance in the storm the Lord had taken away His servant from this life, that is to say, had received his soul into heaven, and had left his earthly tabernacle somewhere on the earth, for which they would like to go in search, that they might pay the last honours to their departed master. Elisha yielded to their continued urgency and granted their request; whereupon fifty men sought for three days for Elijah's body, and after three days' vain search returned to Jericho. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to being ashamed, i.e., till he was ashamed to refuse their request any longer (see at <a href="/judges/3-25.htm">Judges 3:25</a>).<p>The two following miracles of Elisha (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-25</a>) were also intended to accredit him in the eyes of the people as a man endowed with the Spirit and power of God, as Elijah had been. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-22</a>. Elisha makes the water at Jericho wholesome. - During his stay at Jericho (<a href="/2_kings/2-18.htm">2 Kings 2:18</a>) the people of the city complained, that whilst the situation of the place was good in other respects, the water was bad and the land produced miscarriages. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the land, i.e., the soil, on account of the badness of the water; not "the inhabitants, both man and beast" (Thenius). Elisha then told them to bring a new dish with salt, and poured the salt into the spring with these words: "Thus saith the Lord, I have made this water sound; there will not more be death and miscarriage thence" (&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; is a substantive here (vid., Ewald, 160, e.). &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; is no doubt the present spring Ain es Sultn, the only spring near to Jericho, the waters of which spread over the plain of Jericho, thirty-five minutes' distance from the present village and castle, taking its rise in a group of elevations not far from the foot of the mount Quarantana (Kuruntul); a large and beautiful spring, the water of which is neither cold nor warm, and has an agreeable and sweet (according to Steph. Schultz, "somewhat salt") taste. It was formerly enclosed by a kind of reservoir or semicircular wall of hewn stones, from which the water was conducted in different directions to the plain (vid., Rob. Pal. ii. p. 283ff.). With regard to the miracle, a spring which supplied the whole of the city and district with water could not be so greatly improved by pouring in a dish of salt, that the water lost its injurious qualities for ever, even if salt does possess the power of depriving bad water of its unpleasant taste and injurious effects. The use of these natural means does not remove the miracle. Salt, according to its power of preserving from corruption and decomposition, is a symbol of incorruptibility and of the power of life which destroys death (see Bhr, Symbolik, ii. pp. 325,326). As such it formed the earthly substratum for the spiritual power of the divine word, through which the spring was made for ever sound. A new dish was taken for the purpose, not ob munditiem (Seb. Schm.), but as a symbol of the renewing power of the word of God. - But if this miracle was adapted to show to the people the beneficent character of the prophet's ministry, the following occurrence was intended to prove to the despisers of God that the Lord does not allow His servants to be ridiculed with impunity. </body></html>
