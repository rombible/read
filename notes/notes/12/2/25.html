Prophets should make every place to which they come better for them, endeavouring to sweeten bitter spirits, and to make barren souls fruitful, by the word of God, which is like the salt cast into the water by Elisha. It was an apt emblem of the effect produced by the grace of God on the sinful heart of man. Whole families, towns, and cities, sometimes have a new appearance through the preaching of the gospel; wickedness and evil have been changed into fruitfulness in the works of righteousness, which are, through Christ, to the praise and glory of God. Here is a curse on the youths of Bethel, enough to destroy them; it was not a curse causeless, for it was Elisha's character, as God's prophet, that they abused. They bade him go up, reflecting on the taking up of Elijah into heaven. The prophet acted by Divine impulse. If the Holy Spirit had not directed Elisha's solemn curse, the providence of God would not have followed it with judgment. The Lord must be glorified as a righteous God who hates sin, and will reckon for it. Let young persons be afraid of speaking wicked words, for God notices what they say. Let them not mock at any for defects in mind or body; especially it is at their peril, if they scoff at any for well doing. Let parents that would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. And what will be the anguish of those parents, at the day of judgment, who witness the everlasting condemnation of their offspring, occasioned by their own bad example, carelessness, or wicked teaching!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Carmel - Where Elisha held gatherings for religious purposes <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23-25</a> during one period of his life, if he did not actually reside there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23, 24. there came forth little children out of the city&#8212;that is, the idolatrous, or infidel young men of the place, who affecting to disbelieve the report of his master's translation, sarcastically urged him to follow in the glorious career.<p>bald head&#8212;an epithet of contempt in the East, applied to a person even with a bushy head of hair.

If so, we may account for Elisha's visiting it on this occasion by his desire to communicate the facts of Elijah's removal from earth to those who had been his intimates in that quarter. <span class="cmt_word">And from thence he returned to Samaria.</span> Elisha does not imitate the wild, half-savage life and almost constant seclusion of his master. He "prefers from the first the companionship of men," fixes his home in the capital of his country, Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/5-9.htm">2 Kings 5:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>); is a friendly counselor of the king (<a href="/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9</a>), and highly honored by him (<a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>); his whole life, indeed, is, compared with that of Elijah, one of ease and tranquility. But, though living "in the world," he is not "of the world." As Ewald says, "In spite of all the seductions to which he was abundantly exposed through the great consideration in which he was held, he retained at every period of his life the true prophetic simplicity and purity, and contempt for worldly wealth and advantages" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 83). He is thus, far more than Elijah, a pattern for Christian ministers, especially for such as are highly placed, who will do well to follow his example. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the disciples of the prophets at Jericho were so unable to realize the fact of Elijah's translation, although it had been previously revealed to them, that they begged permission of Elisha to send out fifty brave men to seek for Elijah. &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;: whether the Spirit of the Lord has not taken him and cast him upon one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys. &#1508;&#1468;&#1503; with the perfect is used "where there is fear of a fact, which as is conjectured almost with certainty has already happened," like &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; in the sense of "whether not" (vid., Ewald, 337, b.). &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is not a wind sent by Jehovah (Ges.), but the Spirit of Jehovah, as in <a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>. The Chethb &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is the regular formation from &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; or &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488; (<a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>); the Keri with the transposition of &#1488; and ,&#1497; the later form: &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/ezekiel/7-16.htm">Ezekiel 7:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>, etc. The belief expressed by the disciples of the prophets, that Elijah might have been miraculously carried away, was a popular belief, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>, which the disciples of the prophets were probably led to share, more especially in the present case, by the fact that they could not imagine a translation to heaven as a possible thing, and with the indefiniteness of the expression &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; could only understand the divine revelation which they had received as referring to removal by death. So that even if Elisha told them how miraculously Elijah had been taken from him, which he no doubt did, they might still believe that by the appearance in the storm the Lord had taken away His servant from this life, that is to say, had received his soul into heaven, and had left his earthly tabernacle somewhere on the earth, for which they would like to go in search, that they might pay the last honours to their departed master. Elisha yielded to their continued urgency and granted their request; whereupon fifty men sought for three days for Elijah's body, and after three days' vain search returned to Jericho. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to being ashamed, i.e., till he was ashamed to refuse their request any longer (see at <a href="/judges/3-25.htm">Judges 3:25</a>).<p>The two following miracles of Elisha (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-25</a>) were also intended to accredit him in the eyes of the people as a man endowed with the Spirit and power of God, as Elijah had been. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-22</a>. Elisha makes the water at Jericho wholesome. - During his stay at Jericho (<a href="/2_kings/2-18.htm">2 Kings 2:18</a>) the people of the city complained, that whilst the situation of the place was good in other respects, the water was bad and the land produced miscarriages. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the land, i.e., the soil, on account of the badness of the water; not "the inhabitants, both man and beast" (Thenius). Elisha then told them to bring a new dish with salt, and poured the salt into the spring with these words: "Thus saith the Lord, I have made this water sound; there will not more be death and miscarriage thence" (&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1501;). &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; is a substantive here (vid., Ewald, 160, e.). &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; is no doubt the present spring Ain es Sultn, the only spring near to Jericho, the waters of which spread over the plain of Jericho, thirty-five minutes' distance from the present village and castle, taking its rise in a group of elevations not far from the foot of the mount Quarantana (Kuruntul); a large and beautiful spring, the water of which is neither cold nor warm, and has an agreeable and sweet (according to Steph. Schultz, "somewhat salt") taste. It was formerly enclosed by a kind of reservoir or semicircular wall of hewn stones, from which the water was conducted in different directions to the plain (vid., Rob. Pal. ii. p. 283ff.). With regard to the miracle, a spring which supplied the whole of the city and district with water could not be so greatly improved by pouring in a dish of salt, that the water lost its injurious qualities for ever, even if salt does possess the power of depriving bad water of its unpleasant taste and injurious effects. The use of these natural means does not remove the miracle. Salt, according to its power of preserving from corruption and decomposition, is a symbol of incorruptibility and of the power of life which destroys death (see Bhr, Symbolik, ii. pp. 325,326). As such it formed the earthly substratum for the spiritual power of the divine word, through which the spring was made for ever sound. A new dish was taken for the purpose, not ob munditiem (Seb. Schm.), but as a symbol of the renewing power of the word of God. - But if this miracle was adapted to show to the people the beneficent character of the prophet's ministry, the following occurrence was intended to prove to the despisers of God that the Lord does not allow His servants to be ridiculed with impunity. </body></html>
