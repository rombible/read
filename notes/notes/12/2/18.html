But when he withdrew from the world, that Providence which guided the destinies of Israel did not, therefore, forsake His people.

Elisha took it up, not as a sacred relic to be worshipped, but as a significant garment to be worn. Now that Elijah was taken to heaven, Elisha inquired, 1. After God; when our creature-comforts are removed, we have a God to go to, who lives for ever. 2. After the God that Elijah served, and honoured, and pleaded for. The Lord God of the holy prophets is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; but what will it avail us to have the mantles of those that are gone, their places, their books, if we have not their spirit, their God? See Elisha's dividing the river; God's people need not fear at last passing through the Jordan of death as on dry ground. The sons of the prophets made a needless search for Elijah. Wise men may yield to that, for the sake of peace, and the good opinion of others, which yet their judgment is against, as needless and fruitless. Traversing hills and valleys will never bring us to Elijah, but following the example of his holy faith and zeal will, in due time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Till he was ashamed - i. e. to refuse them any longer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-18. fifty strong men, let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master&#8212;Though the young prophets from Jericho had seen Elijah's miraculous passage of the Jordan, they had not witnessed the ascension.

The Hebrew has in both places only the conjunction usually rendered ‘And’. The two clauses are literally ‘And they came back and he was tarrying’ &c. Having acceded to their request, he waited for the return of the searching party. ‘They turn back as wise as they went. Some men are best satisfied when they have wearied themselves in their own ways. Nothing will teach them wit but disappointments’ (Bp Hall).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We cannot dismiss the history of Elijah, which is brought to a close in this chapter, without some notice of the powerful hold which that history took upon the minds of the Jewish people, and of the prominent place which the prophet fills in the writings of the New Testament. In the Old Testament Elijah is rarely mentioned except in these chapters of the books of Kings, yet from the way in which Malachi (<a href="/context/2_kings/4-5.htm" title="So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out....">2 Kings 4:5-6</a>) foretells his coming again we can see that the character of his mission had been fully appreciated. It was felt to be a mission suited for evil times, for times when God might be expected to come and smite the earth with a curse, if men repented not. Elijah is therefore set forth as mighty rather in works than in words. His was hardly the day for preaching. He is also, nearly always, seen to be supported by the loftiest faith, and his message is on that account attested by signs more striking than usual. On the contrary among his countrymen the decay of faith was so complete, that no work of mercy was wrought by this prophet except for a stranger, the widow of Zarephath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The son of Sirach (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/48-1.htm" title="Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp....">Sir 48:1-12</a>) speaks of Elijah as a fire, no unfit comparison, and of his word as a lamp. He calls him a prophet ordained for the reproof of the times in which he lived, and to pacify the wrath of the Lord’s judgement before it brake forth into fury. The day of the Lord was at hand, and his warnings were sent by a startling messenger. And although the wrath of the Almighty was not ultimately diverted from Israel, we can see how the mighty works of Elijah stirred up a more devout spirit in the land, and thus put back the day of vengeance. This influence of Elijah’s life is specially to be noted in the days of his successor. We come constantly upon evidence that even in the house of Ahab itself the prophet of the Lord was held in some esteem, while Jehovah was truly worshipped by not a few in the land, though Baal and the calves had captivated the multitude.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hence in later days, to the mind of the pious Jew, Elijah was deemed to be ever interested in the spiritual welfare of the Lord’s people, and a place was set for him at every circumcision-service. We can see too how his ministry for help was in all men’s minds from the mistake which was made at the Crucifixion, when our Lord’s cry of agony was interpreted into a call for Elijah. That his intervention was ever expected to be salutary is testified by the language ‘Let us see whether Elijah will come and save him’. The large place which Elijah filled in the thoughts of the Jews of our Lord’s day is shewn by the mention in the New Testament of his name and his work more frequently than those of any other prophet; while both in his despondency over the evil condition of the nation (<a href="/romans/11-2.htm" title="God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture said of Elias? how he makes intercession to God against Israel saying,">Romans 11:2</a>) and in the mention of his effectual prayer (<a href="/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>) he is identified most closely with the people whom he so earnestly served as ‘a man subject to like passions as we are’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For such a prophet men were looking in those evil days which preceded the coming of Christ, and from a like obscurity in the desert John the Baptist suddenly emerged in the spirit and power of Elijah (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a>) and all men recognised him as God’s prophet. ‘Art thou Elijah?’ was the first question of those who saw and heard him (<a href="/john/1-21.htm" title="And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.">John 1:21</a>) and Jesus pointed out to His disciples that the office of Elijah was truly fulfilled by the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/11-14.htm" title="And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.">Matthew 11:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘taking up’ of Elijah was accepted by the Jews as a testimony to the doctrine of man’s immortality. ‘Blessed are they that saw thee’ … says the writer of Ecclesiasticus … ‘for we shall surely live.’ Hence the great fitness of the appearance of Elijah with Moses at our Lord’s, Transfiguration. Christ came and brought life and incorruption to light, the former by the fulfilling of the Mosaic law, the latter by taking again His body after it had lain three days dead in the grave. The discourse on the mount of Transfiguration was of the decease which He was shortly to accomplish at Jerusalem. The presence of the prophet who had long before been taken from this world by the chariots of heaven calmed the minds of the disciples concerning the coming decease, taught them that to disappear from among men was not to perish, and so prepared them in a measure to believe the Master’s promise ‘In three days the Son of Man shall rise again’. Hence at a later time they could return in joy to Jerusalem when the angel had announced that this same Jesus whom they had seen taken up, should come again in like manner as they had seen Him depart. They had seen Elijah and by that they were assured that Jesus would be sent again. Thus they became preachers of the times of refreshing when God should send Jesus, the Christ, to bless men, as Elijah in his day fain would have done, by turning them away from their iniquities.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</span> The prophet was not above vindicating the propriety of his past conduct.

He called Elijah &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;, "my father," as his spiritual father, who had begotten him as his son through the word of God. "Chariot (war-chariot) and horsemen of Israel," on which the Israelitish kings based the might and security of their kingdom, are a symbolical representation of the strong defence which Elijah had been through his ministry to the kingdom of Israel (cf. <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>).</body></html>
