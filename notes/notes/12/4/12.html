But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A little chamber on the wall - The room probably projected like a balcony beyond the lower apartments - an arrangement common in the East.<p>A stool - Rather, "a chair."

She meant a room in the oleah, the porch, or gateway (2Sa 18:33; 1Ki 17:19), attached to the front of the house, leading into the court and inner apartments. The front of the house, excepting the door, is a dead wall, and hence this room is called a chamber in the wall. It is usually appropriated to the use of strangers, or lodgers for a night, and, from its seclusion, convenient for study or retirement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Before the prophet, in the door of his chamber, as it is said, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/4-15.htm" title="And he said, Call her.

He seems to have been Elisha's "servant" in a lower sense than Elisha had been Elijah's.

And when he had called her, she stood before him</span>; i.e. before Gehazi. Elisha communicates with the woman through his servant, or at any rate in his presence, probably to prevent any suspicion of impropriety arising in the mind of any one. The prophet of the Lord must not be evil spoken of. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Widow's Cruse of Oil. - A poor widow of the scholars of the prophets complained to Elisha of her distress, namely, that a creditor was about to take her two sons as servants (slaves). The Mosaic law gave a creditor the right to claim the person and children of a debtor who was unable to pay, and they were obliged to serve him as slaves till the year of jubilee, when they were once more set free (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>). When the prophet learned, on inquiry that she had nothing in her house but a small flask of oil (&#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, means an anointing flask, a small vessel for the oil necessary for anointing the body), he told her to beg of all her neighbours empty vessels, not a few (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;, make not few, sc. to beg), and then to shut herself in with her sons, and to pour from her flask of oil into all these vessels till they were full, and then to sell this oil and pay her debt with the money, and use the rest for the maintenance of herself and her children. She was to close the house-door, that she might not be disturbed in her occupation by other people, and also generally to avoid all needless observation while the miracle was being performed. &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, let that which is filled be put on one side, namely by the sons, who handed her the vessels, according to <a href="/2_kings/4-5.htm">2 Kings 4:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-6.htm">2 Kings 4:6</a>, so that she was able to pour without intermission. The form &#1502;&#1497;&#1510;&#1511;&#1514; is a participle Piel, and is quite appropriate as an emphatic form; the Keri &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;&#1514; (Hiphil) is an unnecessary alteration, especially as the Hiphil of &#1497;&#1510;&#1511; is &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, then the oil stood, i.e., it ceased to flow. The asyndeton &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is very harsh, and the Vav copul. has probably dropped out. With the alteration proposed by L. de Dieu, viz., of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; into &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;, "live with thy sons," the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497; would necessarily stand first (Thenius). </body></html>
