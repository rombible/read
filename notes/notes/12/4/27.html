All the mother's tenderness cannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given in love. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lips under this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her. Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready to believe that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. She had not thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes in her own family, but, though a woman of rank, attended on public worship. It well becomes the men of God, to inquire about the welfare of their friends and their families. The answer was, It is well. All well, and yet the child dead in the house! Yes! All is well that God does; all is well with them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven; and all well with us that stay behind, if, by the affliction, we are furthered in our way thither. When any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through grace, that we did not set our hearts too much upon it; for if we did, we have reason to fear it was given in anger, and taken away in wrath. Elisha cried unto God in faith; and the beloved son was restored alive to his mother. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls, must feel deeply for their case, and labour fervently in prayer for them. Though the minister cannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he must use every means, with as much earnestness as if he could do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She caught him by the feet - To lay hold of the knees or feet has always been thought in the East to add force to supplication, and is practiced even at the present day.

And she answered, It is well&#8212;Her answer was purposely brief and vague to Gehazi, for she reserved a full disclosure of her loss for the ear of the prophet himself. She had met Gehazi at the foot of the hill, and she stopped not in her ascent till she had disburdened her heavy-laden spirit at Elisha's feet. The violent paroxysm of grief into which she fell on approaching him, appeared to Gehazi an act of disrespect to his master; he was preparing to remove her when the prophet's observant eye perceived that she was overwhelmed with some unknown cause of distress. How great is a mother's love! how wondrous are the works of Providence! The Shunammite had not sought a son from the prophet&#8212;her child was, in every respect, the free gift of God. Was she then allowed to rejoice in the possession for a little, only to be pierced with sorrow by seeing the corpse of the cherished boy? Perish, doubt and unbelief!

Cf. <a href="/matthew/18-29.htm" title="And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and sought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.">Matthew 18:29</a>, where the servant adopts this suppliant posture when appealing to his fellow for mercy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Gehazi came near to thrust her away</span>] The word in other places indicates a considerable degree of force.

We know from other instances that the prophets were in many cases no more enlightened than others. In <a href="/2_samuel/7-3.htm" title="And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the LORD is with you.">2 Samuel 7:3</a>, Nathan bids David do all that is in his heart for the Lord is with him. But presently he is sent to inform the king that God will not give him leave to build the temple, as he wished. The family at Shunem had been made by the prophet a subject of intercession with the Lord. It is therefore not unnatural that Elisha should consider that their misfortunes might be specially announced. We must suppose that, after her grief had spent somewhat of its force, she opens it to Elisha, and follows her narration with the words of the next verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when she earns to the man of God to the hill</span> - rather, <span class="accented">the mountain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Carmel, where Elisha's residence was - <span class="cmt_word">she caught him by the feet</span> (comp. <a href="/matthew/18-29.htm">Matthew 18:29</a>; <a href="/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22</a>; <a href="/mark/7-25.htm">Mark 7:25</a>; <a href="/luke/8-41.htm">Luke 8:41</a>; <a href="/john/11-32.htm">John 11:32</a>). It has always been usual in the East to embrace the feet or the knees, in order to add force to supplication. <span class="cmt_word">But Gehazi came near to thrust her away.</span> He regarded the act as one unduly familiar or unduly importunate, and interfered to protect and release his master. <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her.</span> Elisha would not have the woman disturbed. He saw that she was in deep distress, and, if there was anything unseemly in her action according to the etiquette of the time, excused it to her profound grief and distraction. The ordinary mind is a slave to conventionalities; the superior mind knows when to be above them. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</span> God had not informed Elisha, by inward miraculous illumination, of the illness of the child, or its death, or the wild hopes stirring in the afflicted mother's mind, which induced her to make her long and troublesome journey. We need not feel surprised at this. There is always a limit to the miraculous; and facts that may be learnt by a little inquiry are but rarely communicated supernaturally. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The mother took the dead child at once up to the chamber built for Elisha, laid it upon the bed of the man of God, and shut the door behind her; she then asked her husband, without telling him of the death of the boy, to send a young man with a she-ass, that she might ride as quickly as possible to the man of God; and when her husband asked her, "Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day, since it is neither new moon nor Sabbath?"<p>(Note: From these words, Theod., Kimchi, C. a Lap., Vatabl., and others have drawn the correct conclusion, that the pious in Israel were accustomed to meet together at the prophets' houses for worship and edification, on those days which were appointed in the law (<a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11</a>.) for the worship of God; and from this Hertz and Hengstenberg have still further inferred, that in the kingdom of the ten tribes not only were the Sabbath and new moons kept, as is evident from <a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a> also, but the prophets supplied the pious in that kingdom with a substitute for the missing Levitical priesthood.)<p>she replied, shalom; i.e., either "it is all well," or "never mind." For this word, which is used in reply to a question after one's health (see <a href="/2_kings/4-26.htm">2 Kings 4:26</a>), is apparently also used, as Clericus has correctly observed, when the object is to avoid giving a definite answer to any one, and yet at the same time to satisfy him.</body></html>
