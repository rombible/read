But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast been careful for us - For the prophet and his servant, who must have been lodged as well as his master.<p>I dwell among mine own people - The woman declines Elisha's offer.

The prophet does not himself address the woman. Most likely, in all things which he required, Gehazi was his messenger to the house, and so the woman would more readily reply to him than to his master. It is clear from what follows that Gehazi was acquainted with the family concerns. There may have been also in Elisha’s mind somewhat of the feeling which the disciples of Christ had (<a href="/john/4-27.htm" title="And on this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you? or, Why talk you with her?">John 4:27</a>) when ‘they marvelled that their Master was speaking with a woman’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou hast been careful for us with all this care</span>] Both the noun and verb in the original are used of ‘fear’ and ‘trembling’. (Cf. Martha’s care and trouble, <a href="/luke/10-41.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things:">Luke 10:41</a>.) Hence R.V. in margin gives ‘hast shewed us all this reverence’. The use of such words bears out what has just been said of the distance kept between Elisha and the family at Shunem, though they were his entertainers. The verb is used for that fear which came over the guests of Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-49.htm" title="And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.">1 Kings 1:49</a>) when they found that David had caused Solomon to be proclaimed king. The LXX. recognises the strong meaning of the verb and gives <span class="greekheb">ἐξέστησας ἡμῖν πᾶσαν τὴν ἔκστασιν ταύτην</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wouldest thou be spoken for, &c.</span>] The prophet offers to use his influence, if it can be of any service to his hostess, with the powers of the land. And we cannot but be struck all through his history with the close intimacy which existed between Elisha and the royal family. This was more likely to occur in the reign of Jehoram, than under his brother’s rule or his father’s. But even of him it is recorded (<a href="/2_kings/3-2.htm" title="And he worked evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.">2 Kings 3:2</a>) that he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and in the expedition against Moab, Elisha declares (<a href="/2_kings/3-14.htm" title="And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.">2 Kings 3:14</a>) that but for the sake of Jehoshaphat he would not waste even a look on Jehoram. There must have been still a great deal of zeal for Jehovah in the northern kingdom to support the prophet, or after such a declaration he would have had little influence with the king, whereas it is the first thing that comes to his mind as a means of rewarding the attention of the Shunammite. On this Bp Hall remarks: ‘It is a good hearing that an Elisha is in such grace at the court, that he can promise himself access to the king, in a friend’s suit. It was not ever thus. The time was when his master heard, “Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?” Now the late miracle which Elisha wrought, in gratifying the three kings with water and victory, hath endeared him to the king of Israel; and now, Who but Elisha?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">or to the captain of the host</span>] If we may take Joab, in David’s time, as an example, this officer possessed immense influence. The same opinion would be formed from the history of Abner, who was captain of Saul’s host, and so powerful as to be able to bring the tribes who had favoured Ishbosheth over to the side of David (<a href="/context/2_samuel/3-8.htm" title="Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?...">2 Samuel 3:8-12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And she answered, I dwell among mine own people</span>] If the king or the captain of the host were to be appealed to, it must be for some case of hardship and oppression. The Shunammite shews she has no necessity of this kind, for all those among whom she lives are friends and relatives. There is no foe to ask protection against, and the kindred are enough to secure her against enemies.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful</span>  - literally, <span class="accented">anxious</span> - <span class="cmt_word">for us with all this care</span> - or, <span class="accented">anxiety</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou hast taken all this trouble in lodging both me and my servant, and in attending on us - <span class="cmt_word">what is to be done for thee?</span> or, <span class="accented">What is there that thou wouldest have done for thee</span>? Is there anything that we can do for thee in return? <span class="cmt_word">Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king?</span> Elisha assumes that he has credit at court, and offers to use it in the Shunammite's favor, if she has any request to prefer. We see something of his influence in <a href="/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9-12, 21-23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4-6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Or to the captain of the host?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the person whose authority and influence was next to that of the king. <span class="cmt_word">And she answered, I dwell among mine own people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The court is nothing to me. I want nothing from it. I have no wrong to complain of, no quarrel with any of my neighbors, so as to need the help of one m power. I dwell peaceably among them. They are 'my own people' - friends or dependents." The reply is that of one perfectly content with her position. Perhaps she aims at impressing on Elisha that she has had no selfish motive in what she has done for him, but has merely wished to honor God in his prophet. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Widow's Cruse of Oil. - A poor widow of the scholars of the prophets complained to Elisha of her distress, namely, that a creditor was about to take her two sons as servants (slaves). The Mosaic law gave a creditor the right to claim the person and children of a debtor who was unable to pay, and they were obliged to serve him as slaves till the year of jubilee, when they were once more set free (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>). When the prophet learned, on inquiry that she had nothing in her house but a small flask of oil (&#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, means an anointing flask, a small vessel for the oil necessary for anointing the body), he told her to beg of all her neighbours empty vessels, not a few (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;, make not few, sc. to beg), and then to shut herself in with her sons, and to pour from her flask of oil into all these vessels till they were full, and then to sell this oil and pay her debt with the money, and use the rest for the maintenance of herself and her children. She was to close the house-door, that she might not be disturbed in her occupation by other people, and also generally to avoid all needless observation while the miracle was being performed. &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, let that which is filled be put on one side, namely by the sons, who handed her the vessels, according to <a href="/2_kings/4-5.htm">2 Kings 4:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-6.htm">2 Kings 4:6</a>, so that she was able to pour without intermission. The form &#1502;&#1497;&#1510;&#1511;&#1514; is a participle Piel, and is quite appropriate as an emphatic form; the Keri &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;&#1514; (Hiphil) is an unnecessary alteration, especially as the Hiphil of &#1497;&#1510;&#1511; is &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, then the oil stood, i.e., it ceased to flow. The asyndeton &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is very harsh, and the Vav copul. has probably dropped out. With the alteration proposed by L. de Dieu, viz., of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; into &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;, "live with thy sons," the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497; would necessarily stand first (Thenius). </body></html>
