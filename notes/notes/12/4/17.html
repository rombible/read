But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do not lie - Compare a similar incredulity in <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>; <a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>.

The interest and importance of such an intelligence can only be estimated by considering that Oriental women, and Jewish in particular, connect ideas of disgrace with barrenness, and cherish a more ardent desire for children than women in any other part of the world (Ge 18:10-15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the woman conceived, and bare a son at the season that Elisha said unto her,....

Hast thou (anything) to say to the king or the chief captain?" i.e., hast thou any wish that I could convey to them, and intercede for thee? There is something striking here in the fact that Elisha did not address the woman himself, as she was standing before him, but told her servant to announce to her his willingness to make some return for what she had done. This was, probably, simply from a regard to the great awe which she had of the "holy man of God" (<a href="/2_kings/4-9.htm">2 Kings 4:9</a>), and to inspire her with courage to give expression to the wishes of her heart.<p>(Note: The conjecture that Elisha would not speak to her directly for the sake of maintaining his dignity, or that the historian looked upon such conversation with women as unbecoming in a teacher of the law (Thenius), is already proved to be untenable by <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-15.htm">2 Kings 4:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16</a>, where Elisha does speak to her directly.)<p>She answered: "I dwell among my people," i.e., not, I merely belong to the people (Thenius), but, I live quietly and peaceably among my countrymen, so that I have no need for any intercession with the king and great men of the kingdom. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (Theodoret).</body></html>
