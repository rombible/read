But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast been careful for us - For the prophet and his servant, who must have been lodged as well as his master.<p>I dwell among mine own people - The woman declines Elisha's offer. She has no wrong to complain of, no quarrel with any neighbor, in respect of which she might need the help of one in power. She "dwells among her own people" - her friends, and dependents, with whom she lives peaceably. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-16. what is to be done for thee?&#8212;Wishing to testify his gratitude for the hospitable attentions of this family, he announced to her the birth of a son "about this time next year." The interest and importance of such an intelligence can only be estimated by considering that Oriental women, and Jewish in particular, connect ideas of disgrace with barrenness, and cherish a more ardent desire for children than women in any other part of the world (Ge 18:10-15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What then is to be done for her?</span> hast thou observed any thing which she wants or desires?

That is, Elisha to Gehazi, when he returned to him, and told him what the Shunammite said: <p>what then is to be done for her? something he thought should be done in gratitude, the favours they had received, and advises with his servant what could be thought of, he being one about the house: <p>and Gehazi answered, verily she hath no child, and her husband is old; and so not likely to have any by him; as children were always very desirable by women, and especially in those days, the servant suggests, that no doubt to have one would be very acceptable to her. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said, What then <i>is</i> to be done for her?

The R.V. is correct, though it seems from the whole narrative that the woman was childless. Of the great grief felt from want of children we learn in the history of Hannah (<a href="/context/1_samuel/1-10.htm" title="And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept sore....">1 Samuel 1:10-11</a>).

Has he heard her express any wish? Does he know of any boon that would be welcome to her? Evidently the woman's disinterestedness has increased the prophet's desire to do something for her. b It does not appear that the woman had made any complaint or exhibited any special anxiety on the subject of offspring. But Gehazi knows, that to be barren is regarded by all Hebrew women as a re-preach, that it exposes them to scorn and contumely (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6, 7</a>), and that offspring is universally, or all but universally, desired. He therefore assumes that the Shunammite must wish for it. And Elisha accepts his suggestion without a moment's hesitation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Shunammite and her Son. - <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>.
