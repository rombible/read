This remark is interesting, because it implies that the faithful in the northern kingdom were wont to visit prophets on these holy days for the sake of religious instruction and edification. Thenius suggests a doubt whether the later practice of resorting to the Scribes on these days has not here been transferred by an anachronism to the days of Elisha.

All the mother's tenderness cannot keep alive a child of promise, a child of prayer, one given in love. But how admirably does the prudent, pious mother, guard her lips under this sudden affliction! Not one peevish word escapes from her. Such confidence had she of God's goodness, that she was ready to believe that he would restore what he had now taken away. O woman, great is thy faith! He that wrought it, would not disappoint it. The sorrowful mother begged leave of her husband to go to the prophet at once. She had not thought it enough to have Elisha's help sometimes in her own family, but, though a woman of rank, attended on public worship. It well becomes the men of God, to inquire about the welfare of their friends and their families. The answer was, It is well. All well, and yet the child dead in the house! Yes! All is well that God does; all is well with them that are gone, if they are gone to heaven; and all well with us that stay behind, if, by the affliction, we are furthered in our way thither. When any creature-comfort is taken from us, it is well if we can say, through grace, that we did not set our hearts too much upon it; for if we did, we have reason to fear it was given in anger, and taken away in wrath. Elisha cried unto God in faith; and the beloved son was restored alive to his mother. Those who would convey spiritual life to dead souls, must feel deeply for their case, and labour fervently in prayer for them. Though the minister cannot give Divine life to his fellow-sinners, he must use every means, with as much earnestness as if he could do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her husband did not connect the illness with his wife's demand, but thought she wished to attend one of the prophet's devotional services. It is evident that such services were now held with something like regularity on Carmel for the benefit of the faithfull in those parts.<p>New moon - By the Law the first day of each month was to be kept holy. Offerings were appointed for such occasions <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>, and they were among the days on which the silver trumpets were to be blown <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a>.

What reason is there for it? what is the meaning of it? <p>it is neither new moon nor sabbath; neither the first day of the month, nor the seventh day of the week, times which were religiously observed; so with the Heathens the new moon and the seventh of the week, and so the fourth, were sacred (u); which notions they borrowed from the Jews; see Gill on <a href="/1_samuel/20-5.htm">1 Samuel 20:5</a> and when, it seems, it was usual to frequent the house of the prophet, to hear the word of God read and explained, and other religious exercises performed, as praying and singing praise, and receiving some good instructions and advice. Joseph Kimchi gives a different sense of these words:"there is not a month past, no, not a week, since thou sawest him;''why therefore shouldest thou be in such haste to go to him? so the words for new moon and sabbath may signify: <p>and she said, it shall be well; it was right for her to go, and it would be well for him and her, and the family; or, "peace" (w), be easy and quiet, farewell: it is much he had no mistrust of the death of the child, or that it was worse, since it went from him ill. <p>(u) Hesiod.

The prophets performed all the duties of the priesthood where it was impossible to have the services of priests or Levites. Thus Elijah sacrificed on Mt Carmel before the slaughter of the priests of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm" title="And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.">1 Kings 18:33</a>). And for purposes of teaching and prayer they appear to have observed the days specially appointed in the Law. On the observance of the new moon cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-5.htm" title="And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at even.">1 Samuel 20:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-18.htm" title="Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.">1 Samuel 20:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-24.htm" title="So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.">1 Samuel 20:24</a>. For its institution see <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm" title="Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm" title="And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;">Numbers 28:11</a>. In the latter passage is a description of the sacrifice to be offered; and we know from the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/81-3.htm" title="Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.">Psalm 81:3</a>) that it was celebrated with the sound of the trumpet. On the observance when it came to be without any spiritual reality, see <a href="/isaiah/1-14.htm" title="Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them.">Isaiah 1:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It shall be <span class="ital">well</span>] The Heb. word is literally ‘Peace’. But it is used in salutations and enquiries after the welfare of another, as below in verse 26. Here however the woman appears to use it as a means of putting aside further questioning. So it would be equivalent to ‘Let be’. ‘Say no more’. ‘Let me have my way’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? it is neither new moon nor sabbath.</span> The husband demurred; he saw no occasion for the journey. It was not either "new moon" or "sabbath"  - times when evidently the prophets conducted services, which were attended by pious persons from the neighborhood: what could she want of Elisha? He had evidently no idea that the child was dead. Probably he had not realized to himself that he was in any danger. <span class="cmt_word">And she said, It shall be well.</span> She uttered the single word <span class="accented">shalom</span>, literally, "peace," but used, like the German <span class="accented">gut</span>, or the English "all right," to content an inquirer without giving him a definite answer.
