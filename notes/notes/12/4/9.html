a good man can take as much pleasure in serving others, as in raising himself. But the Shunammite needed not any good offices of this kind. It is a happiness to dwell among our own people, that love and respect us, and to whom we are able to do good. It would be well with many, if they did but know when they are really well off. The Lord sees the secret wish which is suppressed in obedience to his will, and he will hear the prayers of his servants in behalf of their benefactors, by sending unasked-for and unexpected mercies; nor must the professions of men of God be supposed to be delusive like those of men of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it fell on a day - The original of the expression here used, which occurs three times in the present narrative <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-11.htm">2 Kings 4:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-18.htm">2 Kings 4:18</a>, is also found in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, <a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13</a>; <a href="/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>.

Now when he became their guest she had full opportunity of enquiring from Gehazi, and observing for herself the way in which he laboured to keep alive the true worship of God in the land. The existence of a family like this of the Shunammite is evidence that amid much corruption God was not yet forgotten in the ten tribes. The name ‘man of God’ was applied to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.">1 Kings 17:24</a>) by the widow of Zarephath after she had beheld what great things God did through his ministry. She added also ‘the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth’, which probably represents much of the feeling of the Shunammite when she spake of Elisha as ‘holy’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto her husband, Beheld now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God.</span> Not all the <span class="accented">soi-disant</span> men of God were truly religious and God-fearing. In Elisha's time, as in all others, there were among the teachers of religion some who were "wolves in sheep's clothing:' The Shunammite woman, after a certain length of acquaintance, came to the conclusion that Elisha deserved the title which he commonly bore, was truly a "man of God," a real devoted servant of Jehovah. She therefore wished to do more for him than she had hitherto done. <span class="cmt_word">Which passeth by us continually</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who passes through our village, and has his meals with us so frequently. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Widow's Cruse of Oil. - A poor widow of the scholars of the prophets complained to Elisha of her distress, namely, that a creditor was about to take her two sons as servants (slaves). The Mosaic law gave a creditor the right to claim the person and children of a debtor who was unable to pay, and they were obliged to serve him as slaves till the year of jubilee, when they were once more set free (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>). When the prophet learned, on inquiry that she had nothing in her house but a small flask of oil (&#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, means an anointing flask, a small vessel for the oil necessary for anointing the body), he told her to beg of all her neighbours empty vessels, not a few (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;, make not few, sc. to beg), and then to shut herself in with her sons, and to pour from her flask of oil into all these vessels till they were full, and then to sell this oil and pay her debt with the money, and use the rest for the maintenance of herself and her children. She was to close the house-door, that she might not be disturbed in her occupation by other people, and also generally to avoid all needless observation while the miracle was being performed. &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, let that which is filled be put on one side, namely by the sons, who handed her the vessels, according to <a href="/2_kings/4-5.htm">2 Kings 4:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-6.htm">2 Kings 4:6</a>, so that she was able to pour without intermission. The form &#1502;&#1497;&#1510;&#1511;&#1514; is a participle Piel, and is quite appropriate as an emphatic form; the Keri &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;&#1514; (Hiphil) is an unnecessary alteration, especially as the Hiphil of &#1497;&#1510;&#1511; is &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, then the oil stood, i.e., it ceased to flow. The asyndeton &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is very harsh, and the Vav copul. has probably dropped out. With the alteration proposed by L. de Dieu, viz., of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; into &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;, "live with thy sons," the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497; would necessarily stand first (Thenius). </body></html>
