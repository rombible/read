When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these?

Encouraged by his past success, having killed Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Jezebel, having secured the adhesion of the chief men in Samaria, and effected the destruction of all those who might naturally have claimed the succession and involved him in civil war, Jehu proceeded to greater lengths. He "slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel" - the princesses probably, as well as the princes - and further put to death all the leading partisans of the dethroned dynasty, the "great men," perhaps even those who had worked his bloody will at Samaria, and the intimate friends and supporters of the house - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, as they are here called - not relatives, but "intimate acquaintances." <span class="cmt_word">And his priests.</span> This expression causes a difficulty, since the destruction of the Baal-priests is related subsequently (vers. 19-25).
