From this example, princes may learn two important lessons: 1st, Not to place any dependance on the attachment or fidelity of those who are not influenced by the fear of God, and the dictates of conscience: for who can reasonably expect him to be true to his prince who is false to his God? 2d, Not to aim at arbitrary power, lest they be found rolling a stone, which, some time or other, will return upon themselves.

Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN.

As Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in the wider sense, viz., sons, including grandsons see at <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm">2 Kings 10:13</a>, as is evident from the fact that &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, foster-fathers, are mentioned, whereas Ahab had been dead fourteen years, and therefore his youngest sons could not have had foster-fathers any longer), Jehu sent a letter to the elders of the city and to the foster-fathers of the princes, to the effect that they were to place one of the sons of their lord upon the throne. There is something very strange in the words &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, "to the princes of Jezreel, the old men," partly on account of the name Jezreel, and partly on account of the combination of &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;. If we compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, it is evident that &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be the adjective to &#1497;&#1494; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, but denotes the elders of the city, so that the preposition &#1488;&#1500; has dropped out before &#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;, the princes or principal men of Jezreel, might certainly be the chief court-officials of the royal house of Ahab, since Ahab frequently resided in Jezreel. But against this supposition there is not only the circumstance that we cannot discover any reason why the court-officials living in Samaria should be called princes of Jezreel, but also <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, where, instead of the princes of Jezreel, the governor of the city and the governor of the castle are mentioned. Consequently there is an error of the text in &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, which ought to read &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, though it is older than the ancient versions, since the Chaldee has the reading &#1497;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488;&#1500;, and no doubt the Alexandrian translator read the same, as the Septuagint has sometimes &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, like the Vulgate, and sometimes &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, both unquestionably from mere conjecture. The "princes of the city" are, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>, the prefect of the palace and the captain of the city; the &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, "elders," the magistrates of Samaria; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, the foster-fathers and tutors appointed by Ahab for his sons and grandsons. &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; is governed freely by &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. In <a href="/2_kings/10-2.htm">2 Kings 10:2</a> the words from &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; form an explanatory circumstantial clause: "since the sons of your lord are with you, and with you the war-chariots and horses, and a fortified city and arms," i.e., since you have everything in your hands, - the royal princes and also the power to make one of them king. It is perfectly evident from the words, "the sons of your lord," i.e., of king Joram, that the seventy sons of Ahab included grandsons also. This challenge of Jehu was only a ruse, by which he hoped to discover the feelings of the leading men of the capital of the kingdom, because he could not venture, without being well assured of them, to proceed to Samaria to exterminate the remaining members of the royal family of Ahab who were living there. &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, to fight concerning, i.e., for a person, as in <a href="/judges/9-17.htm">Judges 9:17</a>. </body></html>
