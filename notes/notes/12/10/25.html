Jehu’s guards, after the completion of their bloody work in the court of the temple, rushed up the steps into the sanctuary itself, which, like the temple of Solomon, resembled a fortress.

This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel.

Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62-63</a>.<p>The guard - literally, "the runners." This name seems to have been given to the royal body-guard as early as the time of Saul (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-17.htm">1 Samuel 22:17</a>, margin). It was their duty to run by the side of the king's chariot as he moved from plaze to place.<p>Cast them out, and went - Rather, "the captains hasted and went," or "went hastily;" which gives a satisfactory sense. That the soldiers should have troubled themselves to cast the bodies of the slain out of the temple enclosure is very unlikely.<p>The city of the house of Baal - i. e., the temple itself, as distinguished from the court in which it stood, is intended. The guard having slain all who were in the court, rushed on and entered the sanctuary, there no doubt completing the massacre, and further tearing down and bringing out the sacred objects mentioned in the next verse. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

To some buildings belonging to this house of Baal, which may be here called the city, either for some particular reason now unknown, or because they were very numerous and capacious. For as there were divers chambers and rooms built without the temple, belonging to it, for the use of the priests and Levites, &c.; so it may properly be conceived that this famous temple of Baal had many such buildings, in some of which the priests of Baal, or of the groves, (whereof there were great numbers belonging to the king’s court, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm" title="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.">1 Kings 18:19</a></span>) peradventure might dwell; and others of them might be for divers uses belonging to the house and service of Baal. And into these buildings the guard might go, and that hastily, to surprise and kill those inferior ministers of Baal, who were there employed in preparing things for the sacrifices which were to be offered, or in other services belonging to that house, or that solemnity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering,....

We are not to suppose that Jehu himself acted as priest on the occasion, only as he had been the convoker of the solemn assembly, the whole ceremony is referred to him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jehu said to the guard</span>] The ‘guard’ is that body of ‘runners’ which appears in the history as soon as a king was appointed, and which played a part in all state parade. Thus both Adonijah and Absalom provided them with ‘fifty men to run before them’ when they aspired to the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.">2 Samuel 15:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm" title="Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.">1 Kings 1:5</a>). They are first spoken of in <a href="/1_samuel/22-17.htm" title="And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall on the priests of the LORD.">1 Samuel 22:17</a>, where the text of A.V. gives ‘footmen’ (R.V. <span class="bld">guard</span>) with ‘runners’ or ‘guard’ in the margin. Such men must necessarily be of great physical strength, and so well suited to do Jehu’s work on this occasion:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cast them out</span>] There is no pronoun expressed in the Hebrew. And it is not easy to see why the dead bodies should have been cast out of a place which they wished to be thoroughly defiled. Hence it has been thought that the ‘casting’ here spoken of refers only to the throwing aside the dead to make their way through the courts towards the central portion of the building, where probably the more important sacrificing priests were stationed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and went to the city of the house of Baal</span>] The word rendered ‘city’ is applied to smaller enclosures than we usually understand by it now, and seems here to indicate some principal part of the temple edifice. In illustration of the use of this word for some small place, see <a href="/numbers/13-19.htm" title="And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;">Numbers 13:19</a>, ‘What <span class="ital">cities</span> they be that they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds’. So too the desolate daughter of Zion is compared (<a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>) to ‘a cottage in a vineyard, a lodge in a garden of cucumbers’, and then, in parallelism with these figures, to ‘a besieged <span class="ital">city</span>’. In such passages also as <a href="/genesis/4-17.htm" title="And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.">Genesis 4:17</a> <span class="ital">city</span> can only signify some solid substantial dwelling-place in distinction to the tents of the nomad population.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For a similar change of sense we may compare our English word ‘town’, which in the earliest English <span class="ital">tûn</span> (and in Icelandic still) signifies an enclosure, generally a farm-stead with the necessary outbuildings surrounded by one fence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering.</span> It has been concluded from this that Jehu" offered the sacrifices <span class="accented">with his own hand</span>, as though he were the most zealous of Baal's adorers" (Ewald, ' History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 100); but the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the expression used. The suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span> may be used indefinitely, "when one finished," or "when they finished;" or Jehu may be said to have made the offerings, because he famished the victims, not because he immolated them with his own hand. Throughout heathendom, wherever there wore priests, it was the duty of the prints to slay the victims offered. <span class="cmt_word">That Jehu said to the guard</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to the</span> runners (see the comment on 1 Kings 1:38)  - <span class="cmt_word">and to the captains</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the officers in command of the guard - <span class="cmt_word">Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.</span> We must suppose that some guarded the doors, while others advanced into the crowd and struck right and left. The unarmed multitude seems to have made no resistance. <span class="cmt_word">And they smote them with the edge of the sword</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cut them down unsparingly, smote and slew till none were left alive - <span class="cmt_word">and the guard and the captains cast them out.</span> This is generally understood to mean that all the bodies were thrown by the guards out of the temple. Dean Stanley says, "The temple was strewn with corpses, which, "as fast as they fell, the guard and the officers threw out with their own hands" ('Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 188). But it is not apparent why they should have taken this trouble. Perhaps Bahr is right in suggesting that no more is meant than that the guard and the officers thrust the bodies out of their way, as they pressed forward to enter the sanctuary which contained the sacred images. <span class="cmt_word">And went to the city of the house of Baal.</span> "They made their way," as Ewald says, "into the inner sanctuary, the enclosure of which rose like a lofty fortress - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> originally meant "fortress" - where Baal was enthroned, surrounded by the images of his fellow-gods" ('History of Israel,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.). It is to be remembered that the assembled multitude occupied the court or courts of the temple, within which, in a commanding position, was the "house" or "sanctuary" - perhaps reserved for the priests only. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Extermination of the Prophets and Priests of Baal and of the Baal-Worship. - <a href="/2_kings/10-28.htm">2 Kings 10:28</a>. Under the pretence of wishing to serve Baal even more than Ahab had done, Jehu appointed a great sacrificial festival for this idol, and had all the worshippers of Baal throughout all the land summoned to attend it; he then placed eighty of his guards around the temple of Baal in which they were assembled, and after the sacrifice was offered, had the priests and worshippers of Baal cut down by them with the sword. Objectively considered, the slaying of the worshippers of Baal was in accordance with the law, and, according to the theocratical principle, was perfectly right; but the subjective motives which impelled Jehu, apart from the artifice, were thoroughly selfish, as Seb. Schmidt has correctly observed. For since the priests and prophets of Baal throughout the Israelitish kingdom were bound up with the dynasty of Ahab, with all their interests and with their whole existence, they might be very dangerous to Jehu, if on any political grounds he should happen not to promote their objects, whereas by their extermination he might hope to draw to his side the whole of the very numerous supporters of the Jehovah-worship, which had formerly been legally established in Israel, and thereby establish his throne more firmly. The very fact that Jehu allowed the calf-worship to continue, is a proof that he simply used religion as the means of securing his own ends (<a href="/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>). &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492; &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>), "sanctify a festal assembly," i.e., proclaim in the land a festal assembly for Baal (compare <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; and for &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;  equals  &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;&#1514;, see at <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, and they proclaimed, sc. the festal meeting. </body></html>
