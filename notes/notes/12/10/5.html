They might, perhaps, have temporized, have sent an ambiguous answer, or have sent no answer at all, and have let their action be guided by the course of events. But, taken aback by Jehu's directness and plainness of speech, it did not occur to them to be diplomatic; they felt driven into a corner, and compelled to make their choice at once. Either they must resist Jehu in arms or they must submit to him. If they submitted, they had best (they thought) do it with a good grace. Accordingly, his letter produced a reply, more favorable than he can possibly have expected - "They were his servants," or "his slaves," ready to do all his pleasure; they would not set up a king, or in any way dispute his succession; they submitted themselves wholly to his will. <span class="cmt_word">Do thou</span> [they said] that which is <span class="cmt_word">good in thine eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "take what steps thou pleasest to confirm thyself in the kingdom." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, the two feet, and the two hollow hands. The rest had been eaten by the dogs and dragged away. When this was reported to Jehu, he said: "This is the word of the Lord, which He spake by His servant Elijah," etc. (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>), i.e., this has been done in fulfilment of the word of the Lord. <a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm">2 Kings 9:37</a> is also to be regarded as a continuation of the prophecy of Elijah quoted by Jehu (and not as a closing remark of the historian, as Luther supposes), although what Jehu says here does not occur verbatim in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>, but Jehu has simply expanded rather freely the meaning of that prophecy. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514; (Chethb) is the older form of the 3rd pers. fem.
