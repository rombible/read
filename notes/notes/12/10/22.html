Thenius supposes that festival attire from Jehu’s palace is meant, rather than from the wardrobe of the Baal temple. But it seems more natural to understand that Jehu simply gives directions that all the priests and prophets should be careful to wear their distinctive dress at the festival, which was to be a specially great one.

This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel.

Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal&#8212;The priests of Baal were clad, probably, in robes of white byssus while they were engaged in the functions of their office, and these were kept under the care of an officer in a particular wardrobe of Baal's temple. This treacherous massacre, and the means taken to accomplish it, are paralleled by the slaughter of the Janissaries and other terrible tragedies in the modern history of the East.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Vestments; </span> sacred garments; such as were used by the priests and others of the Lord’s ministry in God’s worship; and from thence the devil borrowed this custom in his worship. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto him that was over the vestry,....

Probably because of the control which had been exercised there by the house of Ahab, Jehu could give orders in Baal’s temple and have them obeyed. It appears from the narrative that vestments were not used only by the priests, but by all the worshippers as well. Perhaps there was some distinction between the character and material of the robes.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him that was over the vestry</span>. The word translated "vestry" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) occurs only in this place; but its meaning is sufficiently ascertained, first, from the context, and secondly, from the cognate Ethiopic <span class="accented">altah</span>, which means "a linen garment." <span class="accented">Linen</span> garments were regarded as especially pure, and were generally affected by the priests of ancient religions, and preferred by the worshippers. Heathen temples had almost always "vestries" or "wardrobes" attached to them, where garments considered suitable were laid up in store. <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.</span> It may be doubted whether "all the worshippers of Baal" could have been supplied with robes out of the temple vestry, which would ordinarily contain only vestments for the priests. But Jehu may have had the supply kept up from the robe-room of the palace, which would be practically inexhaustible. The gift of garments to all comers, which was certainly not usual, must have been intended to render the festival as attractive as possible. <span class="cmt_word">And he brought them forth vestments.</span> The keeper of the wardrobe obeyed the order given him, and supplied vestments to all the worshippers. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Jehu proceeded on his way, he met with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, and having saluted him, inquired, "Is they heart true as my heart towards thy heart?" and on his replying &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "it is (honourable or true)," he bade him come up into the chariot, saying &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "if it is (so), give me thy hand;" whereupon he said still further, "Come with me and see my zeal for Jehovah," and then drove with him to Samaria, and there exterminated all that remained of Ahab's family. Jehonadab the son of Rechab was the tribe-father of the Rechabites (<a href="/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6</a>). The rule which the latter laid down for his sons and descendants for all time, was to lead a simple nomad life, namely, to dwell in tents, follow no agricultural pursuits, and abstain from wine; which rule they observed so sacredly, that the prophet Jeremiah held them up as models before his own contemporaries, who broke the law of God in the most shameless manner, and was able to announce to the Rechabites that they would be exempted from the Chaldaean judgment for their faithful observance of their father's precept (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/35.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>). Rechab, from whom the descendants of Jehonadab derived their tribe-name, was the son of Hammath, and belonged to the tribe of the Kenites (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>), to which Hobab the father-in-law of Moses also belonged (<a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>); so that the Rechabites were probably descendants of Hobab, since the Kenites the sons of Hobab had gone with the Israelites from the Arabian desert to Canaan, and had there carried on their nomad life (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>; see Witsii Miscell. ss. ii. p. 223ff.). This Jehonadab was therefore a man distinguished for the strictness of his life, and Jehu appears to have received him in this friendly manner on account of the great distinction in which he was held, not only in his own tribe, but also in Israel generally, that he might exalt himself in the eyes of the people through his friendship.<p>(Note: According to C. a Lapide, Jehu took him up into his chariot "that he might establish his authority with the Samaritans, and secure a name for integrity by having Jehonadab as his ally, a man whom all held to be both an upright and holy man, that in this way he might the more easily carry out the slaughter of the Baalites, which he was planning, without any one daring to resist him.")<p> - In &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1498; &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "is with regard to thy heart honourable or upright?" &#1488;&#1514; is used to subordinate the noun to the clause, in the sense of quoad (see Ewald, 277, a.). &#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "all that remained to Ahab," i.e., all the remaining members of Ahab's house. </body></html>
