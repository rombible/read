(See Note on <a href="/2_kings/8-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.">2Kings 8:15</a>.) Schröder remarks that it was quite natural for the Israelite sovereign to “throw himself into the arms of distant Assyria, in order to get protection against his immediate neighbour Syria, Israel’s hereditary foe.” Comp. the similar conduct of Ahaz as against Pekah and Rezin (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2Kings 16:7</a>). From the point of view of the sacred writer, this verse states the <span class= "ital">consequence</span> of Jehu’s neglect of “walking in Jehovah’s instruction with all his heart” (<a href="/2_kings/10-31.htm" title="But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.">2Kings 10:31</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The Lord began.</span>—Through Hazael and the Syrians.

This refers to the conquests of Hazael.

But true conversion is not only from gross sin, but from all sin; not only from false gods, but from false worships. True conversion is not only from wasteful sins, but from gainful sins; not only from sins which hurt our worldly interests, but from those that support and befriend them; in forsaking which is the great trial whether we can deny ourselves and trust God. Jehu showed great care and zeal for rooting out a false religion, but in the true religion he cared not, took no heed to please God and do his duty. Those that are heedless, it is to be feared, are graceless. The people were also careless, therefore it is not strange that in those days the Lord began to cut Israel short. They were short in their duty to God, therefore God cut them short in their extent, wealth, and power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To cut Israel short - literally, "to cut off in Israel," i. e., to take away from Israel portions of its territory (see the marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

The meaning is ‘to give over some parts of their land into the enemy’s hand’. This, it is said, should rather be expressed by ‘to cut off <span class="ital">from</span> Israel’.

The ‘coasts’ described in the next verse are all on the east of Jordan, and entirely away from the Mediterranean. Hazael must have thoroughly overrun and taken possession of the trans-Jordanic part of Israel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32-36.</span> <span class="accented">- Jehu's wars</span>, <span class="accented">length of reign</span>, <span class="accented">and successor</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days the Lord began to out Israel short.</span> It is certainly not stated in direct terms that the ill success of Jehu's foreign wars was a punishment on him for his continued maintenance of the calf-idolatry; but the juxtaposition of vers. 31 and 32 naturally raises the idea, and constitutes a strong presumption that it was in the writer's mind. The "theocracy" under the kings was carried on mainly, as the writer of Chronicles clearly saw, by the bestowal of worldly prosperity and military success on good kings, and the accumulation of misfortunes and military disasters on bad ones (see <a href="/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5-12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2-15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2-15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-5</a>. etc.). By "cutting Israel short" - literally, "cutting off in Israel" - is probably meant the conquest of certain portions of the territory. Hazael resumed the war which Benhadad had so long waged, and gained numerous successes. <span class="cmt_word">And Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel</span>; or, <span class="accented">along their whole frontier</span> (Bahr). The frontier intended is, of course, that on the north and east, where the Israelite territory was conterminous with that of Syria. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They then fetched the columns (&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514;) out of the temple and burned them (the suffix in &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; refers to the plural &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514; taken as an abstract noun, as in <a href="/2_kings/3-3.htm">2 Kings 3:3</a>; cf.
