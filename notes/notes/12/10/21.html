This is a question we should often put to ourselves. I make a fair profession, have gained a reputation among men, but, is my heart right? Am I sincere with God? Jehonadab owned Jehu in the work, both of revenge and of reformation. An upright heart approves itself to God, and seeks no more than his acceptance; but if we aim at the applause of men, we are upon a false foundation. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge. The law of God was express, that idolaters were to be put to death. Thus idolatry was abolished for the present out of Israel.

They might be easily convened into one spacious temple, as their number had been greatly diminished both by the influential ministrations of Elijah and Elisha, and also from the late King Joram's neglect and discontinuance of the worship. Jehu's appointment of a solemn sacrifice in honor of Baal, and a summons to all his worshippers to join in its celebration, was a deep-laid plot, which he had resolved upon for their extinction, a measure in perfect harmony with the Mosaic law, and worthy of a constitutional king of Israel. It was done, however, not from religious, but purely political motives, because he believed that the existence and interests of the Baalites were inseparably bound up with the dynasty of Ahab and because he hoped that by their extermination he would secure the attachment of the far larger and more influential party who worshipped God in Israel. Jehonadab's concurrence must have been given in the belief of his being actuated solely by the highest principles of piety and zeal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There was not a man left that came not; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Similarly after ‘And all the worshippers of Baal came’ there is inserted ‘and all his priests and all his prophets’. These amplifications are no evidence that the Hebrew text ever had more than now stands in it. The LXX. often exhibits a desire to round off a narrative in a way very unlike Hebrew.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not a man left that came not</span>] They had been largely encouraged in previous reigns, but now they were to be elevated above all others. Hence all that desired to be popular with the new king and could establish their claim to be counted Baalites, would reckon it a good chance, and come without fail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the house of Baal</span>] ‘House’ is the constant word for ‘temple’ in the Old Testament, and no doubt this building was as magnificent as the architectural skill of Tyrian workmen, and the zeal of the house of Ahab, with whom architecture seems to have been a passion, could make it. Hence it would be large enough to contain in its spacious courts an immense number of worshippers. For ‘house’ used of Solomon’s temple, see <a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm" title="I have surely built you an house to dwell in, a settled place for you to abide in for ever.">1 Kings 8:13</a>; <a href="/context/1_kings/8-16.htm" title="Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel....">1 Kings 8:16-19</a>, and constantly in the history of David and Solomon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from one end to another</span>] The Hebrew phrase is ‘mouth to mouth’ but there is no need to understand, with margin of A.V. ‘so full that they stood mouth to mouth’ which they only could have done in pairs. As in other languages, ‘mouth’ is used in Hebrew for any opening, as of a sack (<a href="/genesis/42-27.htm" title="And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.">Genesis 42:27</a>), of a cave (<a href="/joshua/10-18.htm" title="And Joshua said, Roll great stones on the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:">Joshua 10:18</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-22.htm" title="Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me out of the cave.">Joshua 10:22</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-27.htm" title="And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.">Joshua 10:27</a>), and so any doorway or entrance. Hence here ‘from one entrance to the other’. Almost the same phrase is used <a href="/ezra/9-11.htm" title="Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.">Ezra 9:11</a> (as will be seen from margin of A.V.), of a land filled ‘from one end to the other’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu sent through all Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through the whole of his own kingdom, from Dan on the north to Bethel on the south. <span class="cmt_word">And all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not.</span> Duty and inclination for once coincided. The king's command made it incumbent on them, they would argue, to attend; and attendance would, they supposed, result in a time of excitement and enjoyment, which they were not disposed to miss. The death-penalty threatened for non-attendance (ver. 19) was scarcely needed to induce them all to come. <span class="cmt_word">And they came into the house of Baal.</span> Ahab had erected a temple to Baal in Samaria shortly after his marriage with Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/16-22.htm">1 Kings 16:22</a>). Like the other temples of the time, in Judaea, in Egypt, and in Phoenicia, it was not a mere "house," but contained vast courts and corridors fitted for the reception of immense numbers. <span class="cmt_word">And the house of Baal was full from one end to another</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from brim to brim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> brimful - "metaphora sumpta a vasibus humore aliquo plenis." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Jehu proceeded on his way, he met with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, and having saluted him, inquired, "Is they heart true as my heart towards thy heart?" and on his replying &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "it is (honourable or true)," he bade him come up into the chariot, saying &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "if it is (so), give me thy hand;" whereupon he said still further, "Come with me and see my zeal for Jehovah," and then drove with him to Samaria, and there exterminated all that remained of Ahab's family. Jehonadab the son of Rechab was the tribe-father of the Rechabites (<a href="/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6</a>). The rule which the latter laid down for his sons and descendants for all time, was to lead a simple nomad life, namely, to dwell in tents, follow no agricultural pursuits, and abstain from wine; which rule they observed so sacredly, that the prophet Jeremiah held them up as models before his own contemporaries, who broke the law of God in the most shameless manner, and was able to announce to the Rechabites that they would be exempted from the Chaldaean judgment for their faithful observance of their father's precept (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/35.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>). Rechab, from whom the descendants of Jehonadab derived their tribe-name, was the son of Hammath, and belonged to the tribe of the Kenites (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>), to which Hobab the father-in-law of Moses also belonged (<a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>); so that the Rechabites were probably descendants of Hobab, since the Kenites the sons of Hobab had gone with the Israelites from the Arabian desert to Canaan, and had there carried on their nomad life (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>; see Witsii Miscell. ss. ii. p. 223ff.). This Jehonadab was therefore a man distinguished for the strictness of his life, and Jehu appears to have received him in this friendly manner on account of the great distinction in which he was held, not only in his own tribe, but also in Israel generally, that he might exalt himself in the eyes of the people through his friendship.<p>(Note: According to C. a Lapide, Jehu took him up into his chariot "that he might establish his authority with the Samaritans, and secure a name for integrity by having Jehonadab as his ally, a man whom all held to be both an upright and holy man, that in this way he might the more easily carry out the slaughter of the Baalites, which he was planning, without any one daring to resist him.")<p> - In &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1498; &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "is with regard to thy heart honourable or upright?" &#1488;&#1514; is used to subordinate the noun to the clause, in the sense of quoad (see Ewald, 277, a.). &#1500;&#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "all that remained to Ahab," i.e., all the remaining members of Ahab's house. </body></html>
