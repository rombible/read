Jehu destroyed all that remained of the house of Ahab; all who had been partners in his wickedness. When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these? The answer is, SIN. Shall we then harbour sin in our bosoms, and seek for happiness from that which is the cause of all misery?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehu, placing his adversaries' advantages before them in the most favorable light, called upon them to decide what they would do.

Jehu Causes Seventy of Ahab's Children to Be Beheaded.<p>1-4. Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria&#8212;As it appears (2Ki 10:13), that grandsons are included it is probable that this number comprehended the whole posterity of Ahab. Their being all assembled in that capital might arise from their being left there on the king's departure for Ramoth-gilead, or from their taking refuge in some of the strongholds of that city on the news of Jehu's conspiracy. It may be inferred from the tenor of Jehu's letters that their first intention was to select the fittest of the royal family and set him up as king. Perhaps this challenge of Jehu was designed as a stroke of policy on his part to elicit their views, and to find out whether they were inclined to be pacific or hostile. The bold character of the man, and the rapid success of his conspiracy, terrified the civic authorities of Samaria and Jezreel into submission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus he speaks, either because he had some notice of their intentions thus to do; or to make trial of them, whether they would do so, or would be true to him and his designs; or to signify to them his intentions of fighting against them, if they did so, that by the terror hereof he might bring them to a compliance with him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons,....

No doubt in the popular mind some prince had been marked out as heir to the throne, and some order of succession may have been indicated by Ahab himself, if his elder sons died without issue, but at such a juncture he would be chosen who would rally to him most assistance. Jehu sends his message like one perfectly confident in the effect it will produce.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look even out the belt and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne.</span> "Choose," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "among the sons of Joram the strongest, the boldest, and the ablest, and make him king in his father's zoom; take him for your leader against me; do not hesitate and beat about the bush; but at once make up your minds, and let me know what I have to expect." <span class="cmt_word">And fight for your master's house.</span> There had been a civil war before the dynasty of Omri succeeded in settling itself on the throne (<a href="/1_kings/16-21.htm">1 Kings 16:21, 22</a>). Jehu believes, or affects to believe, that there will now be another. He does not deprecate it, but invites it. Probably he felt tolerably confident that the garrison of Samaria, even if called upon by the municipality, would not venture to take up arms against the army of Ramoth-Gilead, which had declared itself in his favor. Still, supposing that it did, he was not fearful of the result. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehu thereupon entered the palace, ate and drank, and then said to his men: "Look for this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter." &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, the woman smitten by the curse of God. </body></html>
