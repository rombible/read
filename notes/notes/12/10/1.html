The LXX. has “unto the rulers of Samaria.” So Josephus. Thenius accordingly suggests that the original reading was, “and sent from Jezreel to the princes of Samaria.” The Vulg. gives “ad optimates civitatis,” which seems preferable. Before “the elders” we must restore “and unto” with some MSS., the LXX., Syriac, and Vulg. The original text would then run: “and sent to the princes of the city and unto the elders,” &c.

When we think upon the sufferings and miseries of mankind, when we look forward to the resurrection and last judgment, and think upon the vast number of the wicked waiting their awful sentence of everlasting fire; when the whole sum of death and misery has been considered, the solemn question occurs, Who slew all these?

Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria&#8212;As it appears (2Ki 10:13), that grandsons are included it is probable that this number comprehended the whole posterity of Ahab. Their being all assembled in that capital might arise from their being left there on the king's departure for Ramoth-gilead, or from their taking refuge in some of the strongholds of that city on the news of Jehu's conspiracy. It may be inferred from the tenor of Jehu's letters that their first intention was to select the fittest of the royal family and set him up as king. Perhaps this challenge of Jehu was designed as a stroke of policy on his part to elicit their views, and to find out whether they were inclined to be pacific or hostile. The bold character of the man, and the rapid success of his conspiracy, terrified the civic authorities of Samaria and Jezreel into submission.Jehu by his letters causeth seventy of Ahab’s sons to be slain: the fact is excused by Elijah’s prophecy, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/10-1.htm" title="And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.

But in verse 2 we have an allusion to a fenced city as though the <span class="ital">city</span> of Samaria were specially intended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And Jehu wrote letters</span>] Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 6. 5) says ‘<span class="ital">two</span> letters, one to the bringers up of the children, the other to the authorities of Samaria’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sent</span> to <span class="ital">Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel</span>] There is a difficulty here. We cannot see why the rulers of Jezreel should be in Samaria, or why the great men in Israel should have been named ‘rulers of Jezreel’. Hence some have suggested that for ‘Jezreel’ we should read ‘Israel’. The LXX. says ‘unto the rulers of Samaria’, and with this agrees Josephus. But it is very clumsy to say ‘he sent to Samaria unto the rulers of Samaria’. Thenius suggests that the original was ‘he sent from Jezreel to the rulers of Samaria’ which seems much the easiest solution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It was extremely politic of Jehu to send a letter to Samaria rather than to go there before he had gathered a force around him. He had come from Ramoth-gilead with a very small company, and the fame of what he had done at Jezreel would produce more effect than his presence in Samaria with a mere handful of men to support him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">even</span>] <span class="ital">the elders</span>] As there is no preposition here in the original, and the preposition is expressed in the next clause, it seems more correct to take ‘the elders’ as in apposition to ‘the rulers of Jezreel’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and to</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">unto</span>] <span class="ital">them that brought up Ahab’s</span> children] [R.V. the sons of <span class="bld">Ahab</span>]. The change in the preposition is merely to indicate that it is the same word as that before ‘rulers’ in the previous clause. In the final words the Hebrew is somewhat irregular. ‘Them that brought up’ should properly be in construction with some noun, but as ‘children’ or ‘sons’ is not expressed, the word stands absolutely, and ‘Ahab’ is put without connection after it. No doubt the sense is expressed in the translation. Of course it was only for the ‘sons’ of the royal family that this provision of tutors was made, because out of them would come the successor to the throne.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">destruction of the seventy seas of Ahab</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.</span> By " sons" we must understand "male descendants. Most of the seventy wore probably his grandsons (see ver. 3); some may have been great-grandsons. They lived in Samaria; since Samaria was the principal residence of the court, Jezreel being simply a country palace - the "Versailles," as it has been called, or "Windsor" of the Israelite kings. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel.</span> "Jezreel" is almost certainly a corrupt reading. The "rulers of Jezreel" would be at Jezreel; and, if Jehu wished to communicate with them, he would not need to "write." Had any chance taken them to Samaria - a very improbable circumstance  - they would have had no authority there, and to address them would have been useless. John's letters were, no doubt, addressed <span class="accented">to the rulers of Samaria</span>; and so the LXX. expressly state (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but the reading "Jezreel" can scarcely have arisen out of "Samaria" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> out of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), since the difference of the two words is so great.
