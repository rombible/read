It is evident his own religion was very superficial, and yet God made use of him as an instrument of effecting some reformation in Israel.

But true conversion is not only from gross sin, but from all sin; not only from false gods, but from false worships. True conversion is not only from wasteful sins, but from gainful sins; not only from sins which hurt our worldly interests, but from those that support and befriend them; in forsaking which is the great trial whether we can deny ourselves and trust God. Jehu showed great care and zeal for rooting out a false religion, but in the true religion he cared not, took no heed to please God and do his duty. Those that are heedless, it is to be feared, are graceless. The people were also careless, therefore it is not strange that in those days the Lord began to cut Israel short. They were short in their duty to God, therefore God cut them short in their extent, wealth, and power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto Jehu - Probably by the mouth of Elisha. To a certain extent Jehu's measures were acts of obedience, for which God might see fit to assign him a temporal reward.<p>Thy children ... - This was accomplished in the persons of Jehoahaz, Joash, Jeroboam, and Zachariah, the son, grandson, great-grandson, and great-great-grandson of Jehu (compare the marginal references). No other family sat upon the throne of Israel so long. The house of Omri, which furnished four kings, held the crown for three generations only and for less than 50 years - that of Jehu reigned for five generations and for more than 100 years. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

With the calves it was another matter. They formed, as it were, the emblems of Israel’s independence, and so the king’s feeling would be enlisted on their side.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jehu took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart.</span> Jehu's character is thus summed up by Dean Stanley: "The character of Jehu is not difficult to understand, if we take it as a whole, and consider the general impression left upon us by the biblical account. He is exactly one of those men whom we are compelled to recognize, not for what is good or great in themselves, but as instruments for destroying evil, and preparing the way for good; such as Augustus Caesar at Rome, Sultan Mahmoud II. in Turkey, or one closer at hand in the revolutions of our own time and neighborhood. A destiny, long kept in view by himself or ethers - inscrutable secrecy and reserve in carrying out his plans - a union of cold, remorseless tenacity with occasional bursts of furious, wayward, almost fanatical zeal;  - this is Jehu, as he is set before us in the historical narrative, the worst type of a son of Jacob - the 'supplanter'...without the noble and princely qualities of Israel; the most unlovely and the most coldly commended of all the heroes of his country" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 289). The estimate is lower than that formed by most other writers; but it is not far from the truth. <span class="cmt_word">For he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. ver. 29). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;: when he (the sacrificing priest, not Jehu) had finished the burnt-offering (the singular suffix &#1493; may also be taken as indefinite, when one had finished, vid., Ewald, 294, b.), Jehu commanded the runners and aides-de-camp: Come and smite them (the worshippers of Baal), without one coming out (escaping); whereupon they smote them with the edge of the sword, i.e., slew them unsparingly. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;: and the runners and aides-de-camp threw (those who had been slain) away, and went into the citadel of the temple of Baal. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; cannot be the city of the temple of Baal, i.e., that part of the city in which the temple of Baal stood, for the runners were already in the court of the temple of Baal; but it is no doubt the temple-citadel, the true temple-house (&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, locus circumseptus) - templum Baalis magnifice exstructum instar arcis alicujus (Seb.
