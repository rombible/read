Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of God, has but one servant, and he proves a base liar. The love of money, that root of all evil, was at the bottom of Gehazi's sin. He thought to impose upon the prophet, but soon found that the Spirit of prophecy could not be deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. It is folly to presume upon sin, in hopes of secrecy. When thou goest aside into any by-path, does not thy own conscience go with thee? Does not the eye of God go with thee? He that covers his sin, shall not prosper; particularly, a lying tongue is but for a moment. All the foolish hopes and contrivances of carnal worldlings are open before God. It is not a time to increase our wealth, when we can only do it in such ways as are dishonourable to God and religion, or injurious to others. Gehazi was punished. If he will have Naaman's money, he shall have his disease with it. What was Gehazi profited, though he gained two talents, when thereby he lost his health, his honour, his peace, his service, and, if repentance prevented not, his soul for ever? Let us beware of hypocrisy and covetousness, and dread the curse of spiritual leprosy remaining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This Syrian - The words are emphatic.

But experience teaches us that religious formulae do drop from the lips of persons engaged in equally indefensible proceedings. This is partly because formulae by frequent use become mere forms, to which the utterer attaches no meaning; partly because men blind themselves to the wrongfulness of their actions, and find some excuse or other for any course of conduct by which they hope to profit. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Naaman then went down (from Samaria to the Jordan) and dipped in Jordan seven times, and his flesh became sound (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; as in <a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a>) like the flesh of a little boy.
