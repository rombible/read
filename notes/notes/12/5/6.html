Only the principal sentence of the letter is given. The message pre-supposes a not altogether hostile relation between the two kings; and the words of the next verse, “He seeketh a quarrel against me,” point to the time of comparative lull which ensued after the luckless expedition to Ramoth-gilead (1. Kings 22), and the short reign of the invalid Ahaziah; <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to the reign of Jehoram, <span class= "ital">not</span> to that of Jehoahaz, in which Israel was wholly crushed by Syria (<a href="/context/2_kings/13-3.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.">2Kings 13:3-7</a>).

But, as Thenius remarks, he forgets that the relations between Jehu and Syria were throughout strained to the last degree, so that such a friendly passage between the two kings as is here described is not to be thought of.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_kings/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/5-6.htm" title="And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.">2 Kings 5:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now when this letter is come unto thee, </span>&c. — The beginning of the letter, which, it is likely, contained the usual compliments, is omitted, as not pertinent to the matter in hand. <span class="ital">That thou mayest recover him of his leprosy — </span>Or, <span class="ital">That, by thy command, the prophet that is with thee may cleanse him; </span>for kings are often said to <span class="ital">do </span>those things which they <span class="ital">command </span>to be done: in which view, there is no ambiguity in this letter of the king of Syria. But this not being plainly expressed, the king of Israel apprehended that the intention of this demand was only to pick a quarrel with him, and seek an occasion, or rather a pretence, for a war with him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 Though the Syrians were idolaters, and oppressed God's people, yet the deliverance of which Naaman had been the means, is here ascribed to the Lord. Such is the correct language of Scripture, while those who write common history, plainly show that God is not in all their thoughts. No man's greatness, or honour, can place him our of the reach of the sorest calamities of human life: there is many a sickly, crazy body under rich and gay clothing. Every man has some but or other, something that blemishes and diminishes him, some allay to his grandeur, some damp to his joy. This little maid, though only a girl, could give an account of the famous prophet the Israelites had among them. Children should be early told of the wondrous works of God, that, wherever they go, they may talk of them. As became a good servant, she desired the health and welfare of her master, though she was a captive, a servant by force; much more should servants by choice, seek their masters' good. Servants may be blessings to the families where they are, by telling what they know of the glory of God, and the honour of his prophets. Naaman did not despise what she told, because of her meanness. It would be well if men were as sensible of the burden of sin as they are of bodily disease. And when they seek the blessings which the Lord sends in answer to the prayers of his faithful people, they will find nothing can be had, except they come as beggars for a free gift, not as lords to demand or purchase.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That thou mayest recover him - literally, "And thou shalt recover him."

Ben-hadad assumed that, if the King of Israel had in his dominions a person able to cure leprosy, he would be fully cognizant of the fact, and would at once send for him, and call upon him for an exertion of his gift or art. He is not likely to have comprehended the relations in which Kings of Israel stood towards the Jehovistic prophets, but may probably have thought of Elisha "as a sort of chief magus, or as the Israelitish high priest" (Menken), whom the king would have at his beck and call, and whose services would be completely at his disposal. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Feeding of a Hundred Pupils of the Prophets with Twenty Barley Loaves. - A man of Baal-Shalisha (a place in the land of Shalisha, the country to the west of Gilgal, Jiljilia; see at <a href="/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>) brought the prophet as first-fruits twenty barley loaves and &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474;, i.e., roasted ears of corn (see the Comm. on <a href="/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>), in his sack (&#1510;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., sack or pocket). Elisha ordered this present to be given to the people, i.e., to the pupils of the prophets who dwelt in one common home, for them to eat; and when his servant made this objection: "How shall I set this (this little) before a hundred men?" he repeated his command, "Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus hath the Lord spoken: They will eat and leave" (&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; &#1488;&#1499;&#1493;&#1500;, infin. absol.; see Ewald, 328, a.); which actually was the case. That twenty barley loaves and a portion of roasted grains of corn were not a sufficient quantity to satisfy a hundred men, is evident from the fact that one man was able to carry the whole of this gift in a sack, and still more so from the remark of the servant, which shows that there was no proportion between the whole of this quantity and the food required by a hundred persons. In this respect the food, which was so blessed by the word of the Lord that a hundred men were satisfied by so small a quantity and left some over, forms a type of the miraculous feeding of the people by Christ (<a href="/matthew/14-16.htm">Matthew 14:16</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-36.htm">2 Kings 15:36-37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11-12</a>); though there was this distinction between them, that the prophet Elisha did not produce the miraculous increase of the food, but merely predicted it. The object, therefore, in communicating this account is not to relate another miracle of Elisha, but to show how the Lord cared for His servants, and assigned to them that which had been appropriated in the law to the Levitical priests, who were to receive, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4-5</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>, the first-fruits of corn, new wine, and oil. This account therefore furnishes fresh evidence that the godly men in Israel did not regard the worship introduced by Jeroboam (his state-church) as legitimate worship, but sought and found in the schools of the prophets a substitute for the lawful worship of God (vid., Hengstenberg, Beitrr. ii. S. 136f.). </body></html>
