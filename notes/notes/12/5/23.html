Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of God, has but one servant, and he proves a base liar. The love of money, that root of all evil, was at the bottom of Gehazi's sin. He thought to impose upon the prophet, but soon found that the Spirit of prophecy could not be deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. It is folly to presume upon sin, in hopes of secrecy. When thou goest aside into any by-path, does not thy own conscience go with thee? Does not the eye of God go with thee? He that covers his sin, shall not prosper; particularly, a lying tongue is but for a moment. All the foolish hopes and contrivances of carnal worldlings are open before God. It is not a time to increase our wealth, when we can only do it in such ways as are dishonourable to God and religion, or injurious to others. Gehazi was punished. If he will have Naaman's money, he shall have his disease with it. What was Gehazi profited, though he gained two talents, when thereby he lost his health, his honour, his peace, his service, and, if repentance prevented not, his soul for ever? Let us beware of hypocrisy and covetousness, and dread the curse of spiritual leprosy remaining on our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be content - i. e.

Do not oppose thyself to my wishes - consent to receive double what thou hast asked. Naaman is anxious to show his gratitude by giving as much as he can induce the ether side to accept.

May Jehovah forgive thy servant in this thing, when my lord (the king of Syria) goeth into the house of Rimmon, to fall down (worship) there, and he supports himself upon my hand, that I fall down (with him) in the house of Rimmon; if I((thus) fall down in the house of Rimmon, may," etc. It is very evident from Naaman's explanation, "for thy servant," etc., that he wanted to take a load of earth with him out of the land of Israel, that he might be able to offer sacrifice upon it to the God of Israel, because he was still a slave to the polytheistic superstition, that no god could be worshipped in a proper and acceptable manner except in his own land, or upon an altar built of the earth of his own land. And because Naaman's knowledge of God was still adulterated with superstition, he was not yet prepared to make an unreserved confession before men of his faith in Jehovah as the only true God, but hoped that Jehovah would forgive him if he still continued to join outwardly in the worship of idols, so far as his official duty required. Rimmon (i.e., the pomegranate) is here, and probably also in the local name Hadad-rimmon (<a href="/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>), the name of the supreme deity of the Damascene Syrians, and probably only a contracted form of Hadad-rimmon, since Hadad was the supreme deity or sun-god of the Syrians (see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>), signifying the sun-god with the modification expressed by Rimmon, which has been differently interpreted according to the supposed derivation of the word. Some derive the name from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, as the supreme god of heaven, like the &#x395;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; of Sanchun. (Cler., Seld., Ges. thes. p. 1292); others from &#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, a pomegranate, as a faecundantis, since the pomegranate with its abundance of seeds is used in the symbolism of both Oriental and Greek mythology along with the Phallus as a symbol of the generative power (vid., Bhr, Symbolik, ii. pp. 122,123), and is also found upon Assyrian monuments (vid., Layard, Nineveh and its Remains, p. 343); others again, with less probability, from &#1512;&#1502;&#1492;, jaculari, as the sun-god who vivifies and fertilizes the earth with his rays, like the &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; and others from &#1512;&#1502;&#1501;  equals  Arab. rmm, computruit, as the dying winter sun (according to Movers and Hitzig; see Leyrer in Herzog's Cyclopaedia). - The words "and he supports himself upon my hand" are not to be understood literally, but are a general expressly denoting the service which Naaman had to render as the aide-de-camp to his king (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a>, <a href="/2_kings/7-17.htm">2 Kings 7:17</a>). For the Chaldaic form &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, see Ewald, 156, a. - In the repetition of the words "if I fall down in the temple of Rimmon," etc., he expresses the urgency of his wish.</body></html>
