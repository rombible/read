God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help us to inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested in his promises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Syrians had fled probably by the great road which led from Samaria to Damascus through Geba, En-gannim, Beth-shean, and Aphek.

At the same time, no doubt, they feasted on the abundant dainties which they found in the tents. Having satisfied their immediate wants, they proceeded to lay in a store of corn for future use, and crowded tumultuously into the gate, where the corn found in the camp was being sold. <span class="cmt_word">So a measure of fine flour</span>; rather, and a <span class="accented">measure</span>, etc. - <span class="cmt_word">was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord</span> (see ver. 1). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When these lepers (these, pointing back to <a href="/2_kings/7-3.htm">2 Kings 7:3</a>.) came into the camp which the Syrians had left, they first of all satisfied their own hunger with the provisions which they found in the tents, and then took different valuables and concealed them. But their consciences were soon aroused, so that they said: We are not doing right; this day is a day of joyful tidings: if we are silent and wait till the morning light, guilt will overtake us; "for it is the duty of citizens to make known things relating to public safety" (Grotius). They then resolved to announce the joyful event in the king's palace, and reported it to the watchman at the city gate. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; stands as a generic term in a collective sense for the persons who watched at the gate; hence the following plural &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;, and in <a href="/2_kings/7-11.htm">2 Kings 7:11</a> &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;.
