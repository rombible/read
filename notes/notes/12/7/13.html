And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.">2Kings 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-41.htm" title="But he said, Then bring meal.

The <span class= "ital">actual</span> number taken was two pairs (<a href="/2_kings/7-14.htm" title="They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.">2Kings 7:14</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The horses that remain, which are left in the city.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">the remaining horses that remain in it</span>. The repetition dwells pathetically on the fewness of those that survive. Instead of “in it,” the LXX. and Arabic read “here,” which may be right, as the two Hebrew terms closely resemble each other.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, they are as all . . . consumed.</span>—The king’s adviser supposes two contingencies: the horses (and their drivers) may return safe, in which case they share the fortune of “all the multitude of Israel that are left” (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, have survived the famine, but are likely to die of it); or they may be taken and slain by the enemy, in which case they will be “even as all the multitude that are consumed” (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, by the famine and fighting). The sense is thus the same as in <a href="/2_kings/7-4.htm" title="If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.">2Kings 7:4</a>. The servant is not much more sanguine than the king: he says, “They have to perish in any case; whether here by famine, or there by the sword, makes little difference.” “However it may turn out, nothing worse can happen to the men we send out than has already happened to many others, or than will yet happen to the rest.” But perhaps Reuss is right in seeing here simply a reference to the wretched condition of the horses. “Qu’attendre de chevaux qui sont exténues de faim?” A natural doubt whether the starving animals are adequate to the service required of them. “Consumed,” then, means <span class= "ital">spent, exhausted.</span><p><span class= "bld">The multitude of Israel.</span>—The article with the first word in the Hebrew is the error of a transcriber, who, as often occurs, wrote the same letter twice.<p><span class= "bld">The Israelites.</span>—<span class= "ital">Israel</span>.

God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty.

But the text followed by our translators, which is that of the best maunscripts, is intelligible and needs no alteration. It is merely a prolix way of stating that the horsemen will incur no greater danger by going to reconnoitre than the rest of their countrymen by remaining in the city, since the whole multitude is perishing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15. the king &#8230; said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done&#8212;Similar stratagems have been so often resorted to in the ancient and modern wars of the East that there is no wonder Jehoram's suspicions were awakened.

Golgatha, p. 205, and Tobler, Denkbltter aus Jerus. p. 411ff.). These men being on the point of starvation, resolved to invade the camp of the Syrians, and carried out this resolution &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1507;, in the evening twilight, not the morning twilight (Seb. Schm., Cler., etc.), on account of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-12.htm">2 Kings 7:12</a>, where the king is said to have received the news of the flight of the Syrians during the night. Coming to "the end of the Syrian camp," i.e., to the outskirts of it on the city side, they found no one there. For (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>, <a href="/2_kings/7-7.htm">2 Kings 7:7</a>) "the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and horses, a noise of a great army," so that, believing the king of Israel to have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to fall upon them, they fled from the camp in the twilight &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with regard to their life, i.e., to save their life only, leaving behind them their tents, horses, and asses, and the camp as it was. - The miracle, by which God delivered Samaria from the famine or from surrendering to the foe, consisted in an oral delusion, namely, in the fact that the besiegers thought they heard the march of hostile armies from the north and south, and were seized with such panic terror that they fled in the greatest haste, leaving behind them their baggage, and their beasts of draught and burden. It is impossible to decide whether the noise which they heard had any objective reality, say a miraculous buzzing in the air, or whether it was merely a deception of the senses produced in their ears by God; and this is a matter of no importance, since in either case it was produced miraculously by God. The kings of the Hittites are kings of northern Canaan, upon Lebanon and towards Phoenicia; &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in the broader sense for Canaanites, as in <a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>. The plural, "kings of the Egyptians," is probably only occasioned by the parallel expression "kings of the Hittites," and is not to be pressed. </body></html>
