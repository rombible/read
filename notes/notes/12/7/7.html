God can, when he pleases, dispirit the boldest, and make the stoutest hearts to tremble. They that will not fear God, he can make them fear at the shaking of a leaf.

Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is a matter of no importance whether we say that the miracle by which God now performed deliverance for Samaria consisted in a mere illusion of the sense of hearing (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/6-19.htm">2 Kings 6:19-20</a>); or whether there was any objective reality in the sound (compare the marginal references).<p>The king of Israel hath hired - The swords of mercenaries had been employed by the nations bordering on Palestine as early as the time of David <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6-7</a>. Hence, the supposition of the Syrians was far from improbable.<p>The kings of the Hittites - The Hittites, who are found first in the south <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>, then in the center of Judea <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>, seem to have retired northward after the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites. They are found among the Syrian enemies of the Egyptians in the monuments of the 19th dynasty (about 1300 B.C.), and appear at that time to have inhabited the valley of the Upper Orontes. In the early Assyrian monuments they form a great confederacy, as the most powerful people of northern Syria, dwelling on both banks of the Euphrates, while at the same time there is a second confederacy of their race further to the south, which seems to inhabit the anti-Lebanon between Hamath and Damascus. These southern Hittites are in the time of Benhadad and Hazael a powerful people, especially strong in chariots; and generally assist the Syrians against the Assyrians. The Syrians seem now to have imagined that these southern Hittites had been hired by Jehoram.<p>The kings of the Egyptians - This is a remarkable expression, since Egypt elsewhere throughout Scripture appears always as a centralised monarchy under a single ruler. The probability is that the principal Pharaoh had a prince or princes associated with him on the throne, a practice not uncommon in Egypt. The period, which is that of the 22nd dynasty, is an obscure one, on which the monuments throw but little light. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots&#8212;This illusion of the sense of hearing, whereby the besiegers imagined the tramp of two armies from opposite quarters, was a great miracle which God wrought directly for the deliverance of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To save their lives; which they fancied to be in such present and extreme danger, that they durst not stay to take away any of their goods, but every man fled the next way before him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight,....

So Darius Hystaspis, when he began his retreat from Scythia (Herod., 4:135), left his camp standing, and the camp fires lighted, and the asses tethered (see ver. 10), that the Scythians, seeing the tents and hearing the noise of the animals, might be fully persuaded that his troops were still in the same place.

A seah, or a third of an ephah  equals  a Dresden peck (Metze), for a shekel was still a high price; but in comparison with the prices given in <a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a> as those obtained for the most worthless kinds of food, it was incredibly cheap. The king's aide-de-camp (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;: see at <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, an error in writing for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-17.htm">2 Kings 7:17</a>, and for the explanation <a href="/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>) therefore replied with mockery at this prophecy: "Behold (i.e., granted that) the Lord made windows in heaven, will this indeed be?" i.e., such cheapness take place. (For the construction, see Ewald, 357, b.) The ridicule lay more especially in the "windows in heaven," in which there is an allusion to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>, sc. to rain down a flood of flour and corn. Elisha answered seriously: "Behold, thou wilt see it with thine eyes, but not eat thereof" (see <a href="/2_kings/7-17.htm">2 Kings 7:17</a>.). The fulfilment of these words of Elisha was brought about by the event narrated in <a href="/2_kings/7-3.htm">2 Kings 7:3</a>. </body></html>
