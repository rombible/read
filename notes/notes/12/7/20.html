God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help us to inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested in his promises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Syrians had fled probably by the great road which led from Samaria to Damascus through Geba, En-gannim, Beth-shean, and Aphek.

The news spread like lightning through the city, and was followed, as was natural, by a popular rush to the Syrian camp. To keep order at the gate, the king ordered his minister to keep guard; but the impetuosity of the famishing people could not be resisted. The lord was trodden to death, and Elisha's prophecy in all respects accomplished.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And so it fell out unto him,....

The crowd had been in the camp, had eaten and drunk abundantly, and were carrying home spoils, and probably thinking how soon they could return for another load. There would be but little consideration given to the captain at the gate. The excited mob had lost respect for greatness, and so he is borne down in the throng, and killed, having seen the plenty, but had no share of it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And so it fell out unto him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the prophecy was exactly fulfilled. The lord, being appointed to keep order in the gate where the corn was sold, "saw with his eyes" (ver. 2) the wonderful fall of prices within the short space of twenty-four hours, which Elisha had prophesied; but "did not eat thereof" - did not, in his own person, obtain any benefit from the sudden plenty, since he perished before he could profit by it. <span class="cmt_word">For the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died</span> (see the comment on ver. 17). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king imagined that the unexpected departure of the Syrians was only a ruse, namely, that they had left the camp and hidden themselves in the field, to entice the besieged out of the fortress, and then fall upon them and press into the city. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; according to later usage for &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 244, a). In order to make sure of the correctness or incorrectness of this conjecture, one of the king's servants (counsellors) gave this advice: "Let them take (the Vav before &#1497;&#1511;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="/2_kings/4-41.htm">2 Kings 4:41</a>) five of the horses left in the city, that we may send and see how the matter stands." The words, "Behold they (the five horses) are as the whole multitude of Israel that are left in it (the city); behold they are as the whole multitude of Israel that are gone," have this meaning: The five horsemen (for horses stand for horsemen, as it is self-evident that it was men on horseback and not the horses themselves that were to be sent out as spies) can but share the fate of the rest of the people of Samaria, whether they return unhurt to meet death by starvation with the people that still remain, or fall into the hands of the enemy and are put to death, in which case they will only suffer the lot of those who have already perished. Five horses is an approximative small number, and is therefore not at variance with the following statement, that two pair of horses were sent out with chariots and men. The Chethb &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is not to be altered, since there are other instances in which the first noun is written with the article, though in the construct state (vid., Ewald, 290, e.); and the Keri is only conformed to the following &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-14.htm">2 Kings 7:14</a>, <a href="/2_kings/7-15.htm">2 Kings 7:15</a>. They then sent out two chariots with horses, who pursued the flying enemy to the Jordan, and found the whole of the road full of traces of the hurried flight, consisting of clothes and vessels that had been thrown away. The Chethb &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1494;&#1501; is the only correct reading, since it is only in the Niphal that &#1495;&#1508;&#1494; has the meaning to fly in great haste (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>). </body></html>
