Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The position of the lepers is in accordance with the Law of Moses (marginal references); and shows that the Law was still observed to some extent in the kingdom of Israel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. there were four leprous men&#8212;The account of the sudden raising of the siege and the unexpected supply given to the famishing inhabitants of Samaria, is introduced by a narrative of the visit and discovery, by these poor creatures, of the extraordinary flight of the Syrians.<p>leprous men at the entering in of the gate&#8212;living, perhaps, in some lazar house there (Le 13:4-6; Nu 5:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If we say we will enter into the city,....

They ask themselves, however, "Cut bone?" What will he the use of it? The famine is inside the town no less than outside. If they entered the city, by hook or by crook, it would only be to "die there" <span class="cmt_word">And if we sit still here, we die also</span>; rather, <span class="accented">if we remain here</span>, or, <span class="accented">if we dwell here</span>. Lepers, excluded from a city, are in the habit of building themselves huts near the gateways. "The lepers of Jerusalem, at the present day, have their tents by the side of the Zion gate" (Keil, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). If the leprous men remained where they were, death stared them in the face equally. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians.</span> Let us, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, fall away from our own side, desert them, and go over to the enemy (comp. <a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13, 14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> we cannot be worse off than we are, even if they kill us; while it may be that they will be more merciful, and let us live. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king, shuddering at this horrible account, in which the curses of the law in <a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-57.htm">Deuteronomy 28:57</a> had been literally fulfilled, rent his clothes; and the people then saw that he wore upon his body the hairy garment of penitence and mourning, &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, within, i.e., beneath the upper garment, as a sign of humiliation before God, though it was indeed more an opus operatum than a true bending of the heart before God and His judgment. This is proved by his conduct in <a href="/2_kings/6-31.htm">2 Kings 6:31</a>. When, for example, the complaint of the woman brought the heart-breaking distress of the city before him, he exclaimed, "God do so to me ... if the head of Elisha remain upon him to-day." Elisha had probably advised that on no condition should the city be given up, and promised that God would deliver it, if they humbled themselves before Him in sincere humility and prayed for His assistance. The king thought that he had done his part by putting on the hairy garment; and as the anticipated help had nevertheless failed to come, he flew into a rage, for which the prophet was to pay the penalty. It is true that this rage only proceeded from a momentary ebullition of passion, and quickly gave place to a better movement of his conscience. The king hastened after the messenger whom he had sent to behead Elisha, for the purpose of preventing the execution of the murderous command which he had given in the hurry of his boiling wrath (<a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>); but it proves, nevertheless, that the king was still wanting in that true repentance, which would have sprung from the recognition of the distress as a judgment inflicted by the Lord. the desperate deed, to which his violent wrath had impelled him, would have been accomplished, if the Lord had not protected His prophet and revealed to him the king's design, that he might adopt defensive measures.</body></html>
