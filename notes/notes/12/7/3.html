Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The position of the lepers is in accordance with the Law of Moses (marginal references); and shows that the Law was still observed to some extent in the kingdom of Israel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. there were four leprous men&#8212;The account of the sudden raising of the siege and the unexpected supply given to the famishing inhabitants of Samaria, is introduced by a narrative of the visit and discovery, by these poor creatures, of the extraordinary flight of the Syrians.<p>leprous men at the entering in of the gate&#8212;living, perhaps, in some lazar house there (Le 13:4-6; Nu 5:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At the entering in of the gate, </span> to wit, of the city, out of which they were shut by virtue of God’s law, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm" title="All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.">Leviticus 13:46</a> 14:3</span> either the the dwelling place of the lepers was near the gate, or they were come very near to the gate, for fear of the Syrians. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate,....

Four lepers, excluded from the city, and on the point of perishing of hunger, felt that they could be no worse off, and might better their condition, if they deserted to the Syrians. They therefore drew off from the city at nightfall, and made for the Syrian camp. On arriving, they found it deserted. The entire host, seized with a sudden panic, had fled, about the time that they began their journey. The lepers' first thought was to enrich themselves by plunder, but after a while it occurred to them that, unless they hastened to carry the good news to Samaria, inquiry would be made, their proceedings would be found out, and they would be severely punished. So they returned to the capital, and reported what they had discovered. Jehoram, on receiving the news, feared that the Syrians had prepared a trap for him, and declined to move. He consented, however, to send out scouts to reconnoiter. The scouts found evident proof that the entire army had actually fled and was gone, whereupon there was a general raid upon the camp and its stores, which were so abundant that Elisha's prophecy was fulfilled ere the day ended. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate</span>; or, at the <span class="accented">entrance to the gate-house</span>. Lepers were forbidden by the Law to reside within cities (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>; <a href="/numbers/5-3.htm">Numbers 5:3</a>). They were thrust out when the disease developed itself, and forced to dwell without the walls. No doubt their friends within the city ordinarily supplied them with food; and hence they congregated about the city gates. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</span> In the extreme scarcity, it is probable that no food was brought to them, the inmates of the city having barely enough wherewith to sustain themselves (<a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>). Thus they were on the point of perishing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king, shuddering at this horrible account, in which the curses of the law in <a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-57.htm">Deuteronomy 28:57</a> had been literally fulfilled, rent his clothes; and the people then saw that he wore upon his body the hairy garment of penitence and mourning, &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, within, i.e., beneath the upper garment, as a sign of humiliation before God, though it was indeed more an opus operatum than a true bending of the heart before God and His judgment. This is proved by his conduct in <a href="/2_kings/6-31.htm">2 Kings 6:31</a>. When, for example, the complaint of the woman brought the heart-breaking distress of the city before him, he exclaimed, "God do so to me ... if the head of Elisha remain upon him to-day." Elisha had probably advised that on no condition should the city be given up, and promised that God would deliver it, if they humbled themselves before Him in sincere humility and prayed for His assistance. The king thought that he had done his part by putting on the hairy garment; and as the anticipated help had nevertheless failed to come, he flew into a rage, for which the prophet was to pay the penalty. It is true that this rage only proceeded from a momentary ebullition of passion, and quickly gave place to a better movement of his conscience. The king hastened after the messenger whom he had sent to behead Elisha, for the purpose of preventing the execution of the murderous command which he had given in the hurry of his boiling wrath (<a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>); but it proves, nevertheless, that the king was still wanting in that true repentance, which would have sprung from the recognition of the distress as a judgment inflicted by the Lord. the desperate deed, to which his violent wrath had impelled him, would have been accomplished, if the Lord had not protected His prophet and revealed to him the king's design, that he might adopt defensive measures.</body></html>
