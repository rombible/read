Providence ordered it, that the lepers came as soon as the Syrians were fled. Their consciences told them that mischief would befall them, if they took care of themselves only. Natural humanity, and fear of punishment, are powerful checks on the selfishness of the ungodly. These feelings tend to preserve order and kindness in the world; but they who have found the unsearchable riches of Christ, will not long delay to report the good tidings to others. From love to him, not from selfish feelings, they will gladly share their earthly good things with their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The twilight - The evening twilight (see <a href="/2_kings/7-9.htm">2 Kings 7:9</a>).<p>The uttermost part of the camp - The extreme boundary of the camp toward the city, not its furthest or most distant portion.

These measures of Elisha, therefore, were not dictated by any desire to resist the lawful authorities, but were acts of prudence by which he delayed the execution of an unrighteous and murderous command which had been issued in haste, and thereby rendered a service to the king himself. - In <a href="/2_kings/6-33.htm">2 Kings 6:33</a> we have to supply from the context that the king followed close upon the messenger, who came down to Elisha while he was talking with the elders; and he (the king) would of course be admitted at once. For the subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is not the messenger, but the king, as is evident from <a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>. The king said: "Behold the calamity from the Lord, why shall I wait still further for the Lord?" - the words of a dispairing man, in whose soul, however, there was a spark of faith still glimmering. The very utterance of his feelings to the prophet shows that he had still a weak glimmer of hope in the Lord, and wished to be strengthened and sustained by the prophet; and this strengthening he received. </body></html>
