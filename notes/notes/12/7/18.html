God's promise may be safely relied on, for no word of his shall fall to the ground. The nobleman that questioned the truth of Elisha's word, saw the plenty, to silence and shame his unbelief, and therein saw his own folly; but he did not eat of the plenty he saw. Justly do those find the world's promises fail them, who think that the promises of God will disappoint them. Learn how deeply God resents distrust of his power, providence, and promise: how uncertain life is, and the enjoyments of it: how certain God's threatenings are, and how sure to come on the guilty. May God help us to inquire whether we are exposed to his threatenings, or interested in his promises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Syrians had fled probably by the great road which led from Samaria to Damascus through Geba, En-gannim, Beth-shean, and Aphek.

In order to make sure of the correctness or incorrectness of this conjecture, one of the king's servants (counsellors) gave this advice: "Let them take (the Vav before &#1497;&#1511;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="/2_kings/4-41.htm">2 Kings 4:41</a>) five of the horses left in the city, that we may send and see how the matter stands." The words, "Behold they (the five horses) are as the whole multitude of Israel that are left in it (the city); behold they are as the whole multitude of Israel that are gone," have this meaning: The five horsemen (for horses stand for horsemen, as it is self-evident that it was men on horseback and not the horses themselves that were to be sent out as spies) can but share the fate of the rest of the people of Samaria, whether they return unhurt to meet death by starvation with the people that still remain, or fall into the hands of the enemy and are put to death, in which case they will only suffer the lot of those who have already perished. Five horses is an approximative small number, and is therefore not at variance with the following statement, that two pair of horses were sent out with chariots and men. The Chethb &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is not to be altered, since there are other instances in which the first noun is written with the article, though in the construct state (vid., Ewald, 290, e.); and the Keri is only conformed to the following &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-14.htm">2 Kings 7:14</a>, <a href="/2_kings/7-15.htm">2 Kings 7:15</a>. They then sent out two chariots with horses, who pursued the flying enemy to the Jordan, and found the whole of the road full of traces of the hurried flight, consisting of clothes and vessels that had been thrown away. The Chethb &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1494;&#1501; is the only correct reading, since it is only in the Niphal that &#1495;&#1508;&#1494; has the meaning to fly in great haste (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>). </body></html>
