After Asa's time, it suffered more by the friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like, but their own hearts do it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Oriental use of apologues on the most solemn and serious occasions is well known to all, and scarcely needs illustration (compare marginal reference). It is a common feature of such apologues that they are not exact parallels to the case whereto they are applied, but only general or partial resemblances. Hence, there is need of caution in applying the several points of the illustration. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah&#8212;People in the East very often express their sentiments in a parabolic form, especially when they intend to convey unwelcome truths or a contemptuous sneer. This was the design of the admonitory fable related by Joash in his reply. The thistle, a low shrub, might be chosen to represent Amaziah, a petty prince; the cedar, the powerful sovereign of Israel, and the wild beast that trampled down the thistle the overwhelming army with which Israel could desolate Judah. But, perhaps, without making so minute an application, the parable may be explained generally, as describing in a striking manner the effects of pride and ambition, towering far beyond their natural sphere, and sure to fall with a sudden and ruinous crash. The moral of the fable is contained in 2Ki 14:10.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">thistle, </span> a low and contemptible, yet troublesome shrub, he understands Amaziah; and by the cedar, himself, whom he intimates to be far stronger than he, and out of his reach, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Give thy daughter to my son to wife; </span> let us make a match, i.e. let us fight; only he expresseth this bloody work in a civil manner, as Amaziah had done, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/14-8.htm" title="Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.">2 Kings 14:8</a></span>, and as Abner did, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/2-14.htm" title="And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us.

By the return of his messengers: <p>saying, the thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon; intending by this proverbial way of speaking to humble the pride of Amaziah; comparing him to a thistle or thorn, a low, mean, abject, weak, prickly, and troublesome shrub, and himself to a cedar, a tree high and lofty, strong, large, and spreading: <p>saying, give thy daughter to my son to wife; signifying, that if in a peaceable manner he had desired to contract affinity with him, and so establish mutual friendship, he should have despised him as being as much below him as the thistle is below a cedar; and therefore should still more despise and defy him, who addressed him in an hostile manner, and in such haughty language: <p>and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle; and so there was an end put at once to its pride and ambition, and to its treaty with the cedar; intimating hereby, that his soldiers would as easily vanquish and destroy the army of Amaziah as a wild beast can destroy a thistle. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> cedar that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</span><p>(e) By this parable Jehoash compares himself to a cedar tree, because of his great kingdom over ten tribes and Amaziah to the thistle because he ruled over but two tribes and the wild beasts are Jehoash's soldiers, that spoiled the cities of Judah.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">the thistle … sent to the cedar</span>] What Jehoash wishes to convey is that he feels himself utterly Amaziah’s superior, and that he can take no notice of his message. This he does by an apologue (cf. <a href="/context/judges/9-8.htm" title="The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us....">Jdg 9:8-15</a>) in which he speaks not of war but of marriage. The application is however quite clear. The thistle, who asks for the daughter of the cedar, is trodden down by some passing beast and perishes unregarded, while the cedar stands unharmed. Words could hardly convey more strongly the low opinion which Jehoash entertained of Amaziah’s power.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash the King of Israel sent to Amaziah King of Judah, saying.</span> According to Josephus, the reply to the challenge was given in a formal letter, of which he presents us with a copy-  King Joash to King Amaziah [sends greeting]: Once upon a time there was in Mount Lebanon a very tall cypress, and also there was a thistle. And the thistle sent to the cypress, saying,' Contract thy daughter in marriage to my son.' And while this was transacting, a wild beast passed by and trod down the thistle. Let this be a warning to thee not to cherish immoderate desires, and not, because thou hast had success against Amalek, to pride thyself thereupon, and so draw down dangers both upon thee and upon thy kingdom." The force of the original message is much weakened in this paraphrase. <span class="cmt_word">The thistle that was in Lebanon.</span> "Thistle" is a better translation than "thorn-bush" (Keil), first, as a meaner, growth, and secondly, as more likely to be trodden down by a wild beast. The monarch intends to say that the meanest thing in the vegetable world sent to the grandest, claiming equality. <span class="cmt_word">Sent to the cedar</span> - certainly "the cedar." and not "the cypress," as translated by Josephus - <span class="cmt_word">that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife.</span> <span class="accented">Nube pari</span> was a Roman maxim; and the rule was one generally established throughout the ancient world.
