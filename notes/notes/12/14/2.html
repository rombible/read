As he had been called by Elijah to be a prophet in the reign of Ahab and did not die till that of Joash, and forty-one years elapsed between the year that Ahab died and the commencement of the reign of Joash, he must have held his prophetical office for at least fifty years, and have attained the age of eighty. "And they buried him must as marauding bands of Moabites entered the land. And it came to pass, that at the burial of a man they saw the marauding bands coming, and placed the dead man in the greatest haste in the grave of Elisha," for the purpose of escaping from the enemy. But when the (dead) man touched the bones of Elisha, he came to life again, and rose up upon his feet. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489; &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; is a circumstantial clause. The difficult expression &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, "a year had come," can only have the meaning given by the lxx and Chald.: "when a year had come," and evidently indicates that the burial of Elisha occurred at the time when the yearly returning bands of Moabitish marauders invaded the land. Ewald (Krit. Gramm. p. 528) would therefore read &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, a coming of the year, in which case the words would be grammatically subordinate to the main clause. Luther renders it "the same year," in ipso anno, after the Vulgate and Syriac, as if the reading had been &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;. &#1492;&#1501;, they, the people who had just buried a man. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, not threw, but placed hastily. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;: and the man went and touched. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; serves as a pictorial delineation of the thought, that as soon as the dead man touched the bones of Elisha he came to life. &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; is not only applied to the motion of inanimate objects, but also to the gradual progress of any transaction. The conjecture of Thenius and Hitzig, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, "and they went away," is quite unsuitable. The earlier Israelites did not bury their dead in coffins, but wrapped them in linen cloths and laid them in tombs hewn out of the rock. The tomb was then covered with a stone, which could easily be removed. The dead man, who was placed thus hurriedly in the tomb which had been opened, might therefore easily come into contact with the bones of Elisha. The design of this miracle of the restoration of the dead man to life was not to show how even in the grave Elisha surpassed his master Elijah in miraculous power (Ephr. Syr. and others), but to impress the seal of divine attestation upon the prophecy of the dying prophet concerning the victory of Joash over the Syrians (Wis. 48:13, 14), since the Lord thereby bore witness that He was not the God of the dead, but of the living, and that His spirit was raised above death and corruptibility. - The opinion that the dead man was restored to life again in a natural manner, through the violent shaking occasioned by the fall, or through the coolness of the tomb, needs no refutation. </body></html>
