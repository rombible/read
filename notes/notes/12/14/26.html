They that lived in those parts of their country, of which their enemies were masters, were miserably oppressed and enslaved, and could call nothing their own: the rest, we may suppose, were much empoverished by the frequent incursions which their enemies made upon them, to plunder them; and were continually frightened with their alarms; so that there was <span class="ital">none shut up or left, </span>but both towns and country were laid waste and stripped of their wealth, and no helper appeared. To this extremity they were reduced in many parts of the country in the beginning of Jeroboam’s reign, when God, in mere pity to them, heard the cry of their affliction, (for no mention is here made of the cry of their prayers,) and wrought this deliverance for them by the hand of Jeroboam.

The decree was not yet gone forth for their utter destruction. If it be understood of the dispersion of the ten tribes, he did both say it and do it not long after: reprieves are not pardons. If of the utter extirpation of the name of Israel, he never said it, nor will ever do it: for that name still remains under heaven in the spiritual Israel, and will to the end of time.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:23-29 God raised up the prophet Jonah, and by him declared the purposes of his favour to Israel. It is a sign that God has not cast off his people, if he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons are given why God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because the distress was very great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2. Because the decree was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Many prophets there had been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writing till this age, and their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea began to prophesy in the reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amos prophesied; soon after Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God, in the darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be burning and shining lights in it; to their own age, by their preaching and living, and a few by their writings, to reflect light upon us in the last times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The affliction of Israel - That which the Israelites had suffered for two reigns at the hands of the Syrians <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>,<a href="/2_kings/13-22.htm">2 Kings 13:22</a>.<p>There was not any shut up, nor any left - A phrase implying complete depopulation (see the marginal reference note; <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>), but here meaning no more than extreme depression and weakness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 14:23-29.

The repetition is perhaps to be accounted for by the desire of the writer to explain how it came to pass that so great a deliverance was granted to Israel under a king who maintained the worship of the calves. He views it as the consequence of God's infinite compassion, and of the extreme bitterness of Israel's sufferings under the Syrians (comp. <a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a> and <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For there was not any shut up, nor any left</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 14:10), <span class="cmt_word">nor any helper for Israel.</span> Apart from Jehovah, Israel had no one to come to her aid.
