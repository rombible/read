The Chronicler’s statement is that the conspiracy was commenced ‘after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the Lord’. But this we see was immediately after the conquest of the Edomites, when the king ‘brought the gods of the children of Seir’ into the land. There must then have been a feeling of hostility to Amaziah among the right-minded of his own people, even before the battle of Beth-shemesh. We cannot tell whether the conspiracy came to a head in a short time, or only gained strength when the forces of Judah had been so thoroughly overcome by the northern army. But everything points to a desire on the part of the people of Judah to put down Amaziah on the first possible opportunity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he fled to Lachish</span>] Lachish was considerably south of Jerusalem, and Amaziah probably thought that from it he could more easily escape to Edom, or elsewhere, out of harm’s way. The place must have been of the nature of a fortress. For when the Israelites entered Canaan it had a king of its own, who joined in the league for the chastisement of the Gibeonites. The king is described as belonging to the Amorites who dwell in the mountains, so that it must have been in a hilly country (<a href="/joshua/10-6.htm" title="And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.">Joshua 10:6</a>). We may note also that this city was made one of his fortresses by Rehoboam after the revolt of the ten tribes (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-9.htm" title="And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>). Hence Amaziah after he escaped thither may have remained in security and held this place against the conspirators for a considerable time, living indeed, but hardly to be said to be reigning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they sent after him</span>] But we may conclude that his pursuers were not allowed to seize him without some resistance, which may have lasted a considerable time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem.</span> The author of Chronicles connects this conspiracy with the idolatry of which Amaziah was guilty (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>); but, though his subjects may have been offended by his religions changes, and have become alienated from him in consequence, the actual conspiracy can scarcely have been prompted by an act which was fifteen, or at any rate thirteen, years old. It is more likely to have sprung out of dissatisfaction with Amaziah's military inaction from and after his defeat by Joash. While Jeroboam H. was carrying all before him in the north, recovering his border, pushing it as far as Hamath, and even exercising a suzerainty over Damascus (vers. 25, 28), Amaziah remained passive, cowed by his one defeat, and took no advantage of the state of weakness to which he had reduced Edom, but sat with folded hands, doing nothing. The conspirators who removed Amaziah, and placed his son Azariah, or Uzziah, upon the throne, may be credited with the wish and intention to bring the period of inaction to an end, and to effect in the south what Jeroboam was effecting in the north. It is true that Azariah was but sixteen years of age (ver. 21; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>), but he may have given indications of his ambition and capacity. Sixteen, moreover, is the time of manhood in the East, and the conspirators had probably waited until Azariah was sixteen in order that his competency to reign should not be disputed. As soon as he was on the throne he initiated the warlike policy which they desired (see ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And he fled to Lachish.</span> Lachish, one of the south-western Judaean towns (<a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), was at all times a fortress of importance. It resisted Joshua (Joshua 10:3, 31), and was taken by storm. It was fortified by Jeroboam against the Egyptians (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>). It was besieged and taken by Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152). The position is marked by the modern Um-<span class="accented">Lakis</span>, on "a low round swell or knoll," between Gaza and Beit-Jibrin, about thirteen miles from Gaza and nearly thirty-five from Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">But they sent after him to Lackish, and slew him there.</span> So the author of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>) and Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 3); but details are wanting. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehoash took king Amaziah prisoner, and then came to Jerusalem, and had four hundred cubits of the wall broken down at the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, and then returned to Samaria with the treasures of the palace and temple, and with hostages. the Chethb &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493; is to be pointed &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;, the vowel &#1493; being placed after &#1488;, as in several other cases (see Ewald, 18, b.). There is no ground for altering &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; after the Chronicles (Thenius), although the reading in the Chronicles elucidates the thought. For if Jehoash took Amaziah prisoner at Beth-shemesh and then came to Jerusalem, he no doubt brought his prisoner with him, for Amaziah remained king and reigned for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash (<a href="/2_kings/14-17.htm">2 Kings 14:17</a>). The Ephraim gate, which is generally supposed to be the same as the gate of Benjamin (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>; compare <a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>), stood in the middle of the north wall of Jerusalem, through which the road to Benjamin and Ephraim ran; and the corner gate was at the north-western corner of the same wall, as we may see from <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>. If, then, Jehoash had four hundred cubits of the wall thrown down at the gate Ephraim to the corner gate, the distance between the two gates was not more than four hundred cubits, which applies to the northern wall of Zion, but not to the second wall, which defended the lower city towards the north, and must have been longer, and which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>, was probably built for the first time by Hezekiah (vid., Krafft, Topographie v. Jerus. pp. 117ff.). Jehoash destroyed this portion of the Zion wall, that the city might be left defenceless, as Jerusalem could be most easily taken on the level northern side.<p>(Note: Thenius takes a different view. According to the description which Josephus gives of this event (Ant. ix. 9, 3), he assumes that Jehoash had the four hundred cubits of the city wall thrown down, that he might get a magnificent gate (?) for himself and the invading army; and he endeavours to support this assumption by stating that the space between the Ephraim gate and the corner gate was much more than four hundred cubits. But this assertion is based upon an assumption which cannot be sustained, namely, that the second wall built by Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) was already in existence in the time of Amaziah, and that the gates mentioned were in this wall. The subjective view of the matter in Josephus has no more worth than that of a simple conjecture.)<p> - The treasures of the temple and palace, which Jehoash took away, cannot, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a>, have been very considerable. &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, sons of the citizenships, i.e., hostages (obsides, Vulg.). He took hostages in return for the release of Amaziah, as pledges that he would keep the peace.</body></html>
