The ruinous condition of Jerusalem, the plunder of the temple, and the loss of their children who were taken as hostages [2Ki 14:13, 14], lost him the respect and attachment not of the grandees only, but of his subjects generally, who were in rebellion. The king fled in terror to Lachish, a frontier town of the Philistines, where, however, he was traced and murdered.

There was clearly no desire on the part of the conspirators to offer any indignity to the king’s dead body. ‘The city of David’ here spoken of is called strangely in <a href="/2_chronicles/25-28.htm" title="And they brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.">2 Chronicles 25:28</a> ‘the city of Judah’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they brought him on horses</span>; literally, on the horses, which must mean "on <span class="accented">his</span> horses." Probably Amaziah had fled to Lachish in the royal chariot, and his body was now brought back in it to Jerusalem. The conspirators were evidently minded to treat the royal corpse with all respect. <span class="cmt_word">And he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the city on the eastern hill, which David took from the Jebusites (see the comment on 1 Kings 2:10). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jehoash took king Amaziah prisoner, and then came to Jerusalem, and had four hundred cubits of the wall broken down at the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, and then returned to Samaria with the treasures of the palace and temple, and with hostages. the Chethb &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493; is to be pointed &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;, the vowel &#1493; being placed after &#1488;, as in several other cases (see Ewald, 18, b.). There is no ground for altering &#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; after the Chronicles (Thenius), although the reading in the Chronicles elucidates the thought. For if Jehoash took Amaziah prisoner at Beth-shemesh and then came to Jerusalem, he no doubt brought his prisoner with him, for Amaziah remained king and reigned for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash (<a href="/2_kings/14-17.htm">2 Kings 14:17</a>). The Ephraim gate, which is generally supposed to be the same as the gate of Benjamin (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>; compare <a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>), stood in the middle of the north wall of Jerusalem, through which the road to Benjamin and Ephraim ran; and the corner gate was at the north-western corner of the same wall, as we may see from <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>. If, then, Jehoash had four hundred cubits of the wall thrown down at the gate Ephraim to the corner gate, the distance between the two gates was not more than four hundred cubits, which applies to the northern wall of Zion, but not to the second wall, which defended the lower city towards the north, and must have been longer, and which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>, was probably built for the first time by Hezekiah (vid., Krafft, Topographie v. Jerus. pp. 117ff.). Jehoash destroyed this portion of the Zion wall, that the city might be left defenceless, as Jerusalem could be most easily taken on the level northern side.<p>(Note: Thenius takes a different view. According to the description which Josephus gives of this event (Ant. ix. 9, 3), he assumes that Jehoash had the four hundred cubits of the city wall thrown down, that he might get a magnificent gate (?) for himself and the invading army; and he endeavours to support this assumption by stating that the space between the Ephraim gate and the corner gate was much more than four hundred cubits. But this assertion is based upon an assumption which cannot be sustained, namely, that the second wall built by Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) was already in existence in the time of Amaziah, and that the gates mentioned were in this wall. The subjective view of the matter in Josephus has no more worth than that of a simple conjecture.)<p> - The treasures of the temple and palace, which Jehoash took away, cannot, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/12-19.htm">2 Kings 12:19</a>, have been very considerable. &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, sons of the citizenships, i.e., hostages (obsides, Vulg.). He took hostages in return for the release of Amaziah, as pledges that he would keep the peace.</body></html>
