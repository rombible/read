After Asa's time, it suffered more by the friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like, but their own hearts do it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The author of Chronicles notes that Amaziah's obstinacy, and his consequent defeat and captivity, were judgments upon him for an idolatry into which he had fallen after his conquest of Edom <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/25-20.htm">2 Chronicles 25:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-14. But Amaziah would not hear&#8212;The sarcastic tenor of this reply incited the king of Judah the more; for, being in a state of judicial blindness and infatuation (2Ch 25:20), he was immovably determined on war. But the superior energy of Joash surprised him ere he had completed his military preparations. Pouring a large army into the territory of Judah, he encountered Amaziah in a pitched battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Then having marched to Jerusalem [2Ki 14:13], he not only demolished part of the city walls, but plundered the treasures of the palace and temple. Taking hostages to prevent any further molestation from Judah, he terminated the war. Without leaving a garrison in Jerusalem, he returned to his capital with all convenient speed, his presence and all his forces being required to repel the troublesome incursions of the Syrians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Being unsatisfied in the ground and manner of the quarrel, and discouraged by their king’s idolatry, and smitten by God with a spirit of fear. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel,....

This was the first trial of strength between the two nations of which we have any distinct account. It resulted in the complete discomfiture of Israel.
