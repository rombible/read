It is a sign that God has not cast off his people, if he continues faithful ministers among them. Two reasons are given why God blessed them with those victories: 1. Because the distress was very great, which made them objects of his compassion. 2. Because the decree was not yet gone forth for their destruction. Many prophets there had been in Israel, but none left prophecies in writing till this age, and their prophecies are part of the Bible. Hosea began to prophesy in the reign of this Jeroboam. At the same time Amos prophesied; soon after Micah, then Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah. Thus God, in the darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be burning and shining lights in it; to their own age, by their preaching and living, and a few by their writings, to reflect light upon us in the last times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jeroboam - This is the only instance, in the history of either kingdom, of a recurrent royal appellation. We can scarcely doubt that Jeroboam II was named after the great founder of the Israelite kingdom by a father who trusted that he might prove a sort of second founder. Perhaps the prophecy of Jonah (see <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>) had been already given, and it was known that a great deliverance was approaching. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 14:23-29.

While God granted him so great a measure of national prosperity and eminence, the reason is expressly stated (2Ki 14:26, 27) to be that the purposes of the divine covenant forbade as yet the overthrow of the kingdom of the ten tribes (see 2Ki 13:23).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria,....

This reign, the most important of those belonging to the kingdom of Israel since that of Ahab, is treated with great brevity by the writer, whose interest is far more in Judah than in Israel. Seven verses only are devoted to him. The result of his wars is given without any account of the wars themselves. And the great fact of his ruling over Damascus only comes in by a sort of afterthought (ver. 28). The usual formulas are followed in introducing his reign and missing it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash King of Judah</span> - this note of time agrees with those in <a href="/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10</a> and 2 Kings 45:1, 17, but not with that in <a href="/2_kings/15-1.htm">2 Kings 15:1</a> (see the comment on that passage) - <span class="cmt_word">Jeroboam the son of Joash King of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.</span> Josephus says "forty years., Many moderns (Thenius, Bahr, and others) extend the term to fifty-one years. Some suppose that Jeroboam was joint-king with his father in Amaziah's third year, solo king from his fifteenth. But it is better to acknowledge the general confusion of the chronology, and to regard it as uncertain, unless where a synchronism is distinctly made out. Such assured synchronisms are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The synchronism of Ahab with Jehoshaphat: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the synchronism of Jehoram, Ahab's son, with the same; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the synchronism of Jehu's first year with the first year of Athaliah; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the synchronism of Amaziah with Joash of Israel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> the synchronism of Pekah with Ahaz; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the synchronism of Hoshea's last year with Hezekiah's sixth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> the synchronism of Amaziah's fourteenth year with Jeroboam II.'s first, being twice asserted in two distinct forms (vers. 17 and 23), is, at any rate, highly probable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Numbers which occur once only in ancient writers can seldom be implicitly trusted, since the liability of numbers to corruption is excessive. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The repetition of the notice concerning the end of the reign of Joash, together with the formula from <a href="/2_kings/13-12.htm">2 Kings 13:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-13.htm">2 Kings 13:13</a>, may probably be explained from the fact, that in the annals of the kings of Israel it stood after the account of the war between Jehoash and Amaziah. This may be inferred from the circumstance that the name of Joash is spelt invariably &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; here, whereas in the closing notices in <a href="/2_kings/13-12.htm">2 Kings 13:12</a> and <a href="/2_kings/13-13.htm">2 Kings 13:13</a> we have the later form &#1497;&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, the one which was no doubt adopted by the author of our books. But he might be induced to give these notices once more as he found them in his original sources, from the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-17.htm">2 Kings 14:17</a>, that Amaziah outlived Jehoash fifteen years, seeing therein a manifestation of the grace of God, who would not destroy Amaziah notwithstanding his pride, but delivered him, through the death of his victor, from further injuries at his hands. As Amaziah ascended the throne in the second year of the sixteen years' reign of Jehoash, and before his war with Israel made war upon the Edomites and overcame them, the war with Israel can only fall in the closing years of Jehoash, and this king cannot very long have survived his triumph over the king of Judah.</body></html>
