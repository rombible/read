After Asa's time, it suffered more by the friendship of Israel, and by the alliance made with them. Now we meet with hostility between them again. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and scornful men set their wits on work, to vilify and undervalue one another! Unholy success excites pride; pride excites contentions. The effects of pride in others, are insufferable to those who are proud themselves. These are the sources of trouble and sin in private life; but when they arise between princes, they become the misery of their whole kingdoms. Jehoash shows Amaziah the folly of his challenge; Thine heart has lifted thee up. The root of all sin is in the heart, thence it flows. It is not Providence, the event, the occasion, whatever it is, that makes men proud, secure, discontented, or the like, but their own hearts do it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehoash did not wait to be attacked. Invading Judaea from the west, and so ascending out of the low coast tract, he met the army of Amaziah at Beth-shemesh (see <a href="/joshua/19-21.htm">Joshua 19:21</a> note), about 15 miles from Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-14. But Amaziah would not hear&#8212;The sarcastic tenor of this reply incited the king of Judah the more; for, being in a state of judicial blindness and infatuation (2Ch 25:20), he was immovably determined on war. But the superior energy of Joash surprised him ere he had completed his military preparations. Pouring a large army into the territory of Judah, he encountered Amaziah in a pitched battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Then having marched to Jerusalem [2Ki 14:13], he not only demolished part of the city walls, but plundered the treasures of the palace and temple. Taking hostages to prevent any further molestation from Judah, he terminated the war. Without leaving a garrison in Jerusalem, he returned to his capital with all convenient speed, his presence and all his forces being required to repel the troublesome incursions of the Syrians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Amaziah would not hear, </span> because God blinded and hardened him to his destruction, for his abominable and ridiculous idolatry, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/25-20.htm" title="But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.">2 Chronicles 25:20</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jehoash went up, </span> to wit, into the kingdom of Judah, carrying the war into his enemy’s country. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which belongeth to Judah; </span> which is added to distinguish it from that Beth-shemesh in Issachar, and another in Naphtali, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/19-22.htm" title="And the coast reaches to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.">Joshua 19:22</a>,38</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Amaziah would not hear,....

On hearing it, Amaziah (as Josephus says, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:9. &sect; 3) was the more spurred on to make his expedition. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore Jehoash King of Israel went up.</span> "Joash," as Bahr says, "did not wait for the attack of Amaziah, but anticipated his movements, and carried the war into the enemy's country." Defensive warfare often requires such an Offensive movement. <span class="cmt_word">And he and Amaziah King of Judah looked one another in the face</span> - e.g., came to an engagement (setup. ver. 8) - <span class="cmt_word">at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</span> Beth-shemesh was assigned to Judah by Joshua (Joshua 19:38), and lay on its western frontier line. Its position is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Ain-Shems</span>, which lies nearly due west of Jerusalem, on the road from Hebron to Jaffa. Ain-Shems itself is an Arab village, but "just to the west of it are the manifest traces of an ancient site" (Robinson, 'Researches,' vol. 3. p. 17). The position commands the approach from the Philistine plain; and we may suspect that Joash, avoiding the direct line of approach, led his troops to the attack through Philistia, as was so often done by the Syrians in their attacks on the Maccabees (see 1 Macc. 3:40 1 Macc. 13:12, 13 1 Macc. 15:40 1 Macc. 16:4-8, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After establishing his own government, he punished the murderers of his father with death; but, according to the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, he did not slay their children also, as was commonly the custom in the East in ancient times, and may very frequently have been done in Israel as well.
