The report of Rabshakeh's speech, recorded in the preceding chapter: <p>that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth; rent his clothes because of the blasphemy in the speech; and he put on sackcloth, in token of mourning, for the calamities he feared were coming on him and his people: and he went into the house of the Lord; the temple, to pray unto him. The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day <i>is</i> a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> the birth, and <i>there is</i> not strength to bring forth.</span><p>(b) The dangers are so great, that we can neither avenge this blasphemy, or help ourselves any more than a woman in labour.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">This day</span> is <span class="ital">a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">contumely</span>. The words refer to the condition of Hezekiah and his people. First they are in great anguish, kept in and surrounded by a threatening and mighty enemy, this is the trouble: then they are reminded of their offences and feel that for their wrong they are under chastisement and reproof: and lastly, that they are given over to the adversaries so that their enemies mock at their confidence with insolent derision. Hence without help from God, and with no hope from men, their conceptions of freedom and liberty were likely all to prove abortive, and come to no result. The figure which the king employs indicates that they were in the extremest danger, and had no power to save themselves.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of Blasphemy.</span> Of "trouble," or "distress," manifestly - a day on which the whole nation is troubled, grieved, alarmed, distressed, made miserable.

As a proof of this, Rabshakeh enumerated a number of cities and lands which the king of Assyria had conquered, without their gods' being able to offer any resistance to his power. "Where are the gods of Hamath, etc., that they might have delivered Samaria out of my hand?" Instead of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; we have &#1492;&#1509; &#1493;&#1499;&#1497; and that they might have, which loosens the connection somewhat more between this clause and the preceding one, and makes it more independent. "Where are they?" is equivalent to they are gone, have perished (cf. <a href="/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>); and "that they might have delivered" is equivalent to they have not delivered. The subject to &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, which includes the God of Samaria. Sennacherib regards himself as being as it were one with his predecessors, as the representative of the might of Assyria, so that he attributes to himself the conquests of cities and lands which his ancestors had made. The cities and lands enumerated in <a href="/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a> have been mentioned already in <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a> as conquered territories, from which colonists had been transplanted to Samaria, with the exception of Arpad and Hena. &#1488;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491;, which is also mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>, in connection with Hamath, was certainly situated in the neighbourhood of that city, and still exists, so far as the name is concerned, in the large village of rfd, Arfd (mentioned by Maraszid, i. 47), in northern Syria in the district of Azz, which was seven hours to the north of Haleb, according to Abulf. Tab. Syr. ed.

The names &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1504;&#1506; are omitted from the text of Isaiah in consequence of the abridgment of Rabshakeh's address.</body></html>
