Those who speak from God to us, we should in a particular manner desire to speak to God for us. The great Prophet is the great Intercessor.

His own writings show us how active a part he had taken in it for many years previously. This was the fourth reign since he began his prophesyings; and during two reigns at least, those of Ahaz and Hezekiah, he had been a familiar counselor of the monarch. He had probably counseled the revolt from Assyria, and had encouraged the king and people to persevere in their resistance. The exact date of prophecies can seldom be fixed with any certainty; but we can scarcely he mistaken in regarding <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10.htm">2 Kings 10</a>; 30; 31 as written about the time of Hezekiah's second revolt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 19<p>2Ki 19:1-5.

The expression in which the message was conveyed described, by a strong figure, the desperate condition of the kingdom, together with their own inability to help themselves; and it intimated also a hope, that the blasphemous defiance of Jehovah's power by the impious Assyrian might lead to some direct interposition for the vindication of His honor and supremacy to all heathen gods.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it,....

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he sent Eliakim, which <i>was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</span><p>(a) To hear some new prophecy and to have comfort from him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">he sent … to Esai</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Isaiah</span>. The historian has up to this time never mentioned the name of the great prophet. But we know from Isaiah’s own writings that as early as the reign of Uzziah (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>) the Lord had revealed His majesty to the son of Amoz, and had sent him to bear witness unto Judah. The reigns of Jotham and Ahaz are past, and to the latter king Isaiah had brought the message of deliverance from Pekah and Rezin, which had been fully accomplished, so that Ephraim was now broken and was no more a people (<a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm" title="For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.">Isaiah 7:8</a>). We may be sure that one so endowed with insight into the divine will had been taken at once into the councils of Hezekiah, and that no one’s words had carried more weight. It may well be that Isaiah had advised the struggle for freedom which Hezekiah undertook, and certainly during the fourteen years (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2 Kings 18:13</a>) which had elapsed since Hezekiah came to the throne the God-fearing king had done much, may we not say most things, by the advice of the prophet. Hence when the days are darkest, it is to Isaiah he sends as the source of true light.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests.</span> "The elders of the priests" are aged men holding the priestly office, not necessarily the high priest, or the most notable or most dignified of the priests. The king felt that his best hope, so far as man was concerned, lay in the prophetical order. Isaiah, Hosed, Joel, Micah, and perhaps Obadiah, were the prophets of the time; but it is not clear that any of them were accessible except Isaiah. He had been Ahaz's counselor (<a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>), and was now certainly among the regular counselors of Hezekiah. Moreover, he was in Jerusalem, and could readily be consulted. Hezekiah, therefore, sends to him in his distress, and sends a most honorable and dignified embassy. It is his intention to treat the prophet with the utmost respect and courtesy. No doubt, at this period the prophetical order stood higher than the priestly one in general estimation; and not unworthily. If any living man could give the king sound advice under the circumstances, it was the son of Amoz. <span class="cmt_word">Covered with sackcloth.</span> Probably by the king's command.

As a proof of this, Rabshakeh enumerated a number of cities and lands which the king of Assyria had conquered, without their gods' being able to offer any resistance to his power. "Where are the gods of Hamath, etc., that they might have delivered Samaria out of my hand?" Instead of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; we have &#1492;&#1509; &#1493;&#1499;&#1497; and that they might have, which loosens the connection somewhat more between this clause and the preceding one, and makes it more independent. "Where are they?" is equivalent to they are gone, have perished (cf. <a href="/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>); and "that they might have delivered" is equivalent to they have not delivered. The subject to &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, which includes the God of Samaria. Sennacherib regards himself as being as it were one with his predecessors, as the representative of the might of Assyria, so that he attributes to himself the conquests of cities and lands which his ancestors had made. The cities and lands enumerated in <a href="/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a> have been mentioned already in <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a> as conquered territories, from which colonists had been transplanted to Samaria, with the exception of Arpad and Hena. &#1488;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491;, which is also mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-13.htm">Isaiah 37:13</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>, in connection with Hamath, was certainly situated in the neighbourhood of that city, and still exists, so far as the name is concerned, in the large village of rfd, Arfd (mentioned by Maraszid, i. 47), in northern Syria in the district of Azz, which was seven hours to the north of Haleb, according to Abulf.

The names &#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1504;&#1506; are omitted from the text of Isaiah in consequence of the abridgment of Rabshakeh's address.</body></html>
