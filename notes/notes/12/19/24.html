God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory. May our hearts be as good ground, that his word may strike root therein, and bring forth fruit in our lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have digged and drunk ... and dried up - The meaning seems to be - "Mountains do not stop me - I cross them even in my chariots.

The singular form, Mazor (compare the modern Misr and the Assyrian Muzr), is here used instead of the ordinary dual form, Mizraim, perhaps because "Lower Egypt" only is intended. This was so cut up with canals and branches of the Nile, natural and artificial, that it was regarded as impassable for chariots and horses. Sennacherib, however, thought that these many streams would prove no impediments to him; he would advance as fast as if they were "dried up." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Then Isaiah &#8230; sent&#8212;A revelation having been made to Isaiah, the prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The prophetic message consisted of three different portions:&#8212;First, Sennacherib is apostrophized (2Ki 19:21-28) in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot. Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed (2Ki 19:29-31), and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance&#8212;namely, that for two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is announced (2Ki 19:32-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Strange waters; </span> such as were never discovered nor used by others.

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">I have digged and drunk strange waters</span>] Probably there is some allusion in this boast which is put into the mouth of Sennacherib to the attempts made by Hezekiah (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/32-3.htm" title="He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him....">2 Chronicles 32:3-4</a>) to deprive the Assyrians of a supply of water. Sennacherib means to say: ‘Do what you may I am able by digging wells wherever I go to get water for my host, even where none had been found before’. This is most likely the sense of ‘strange’, which word does not appear in the corresponding verse of Isaiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And with the sole of my feet have I dried</span>] [R.V. <span class="bld">will I dry</span>] <span class="ital">up all the rivers of besieged</span> places] R.V. <span class="bld">of Egypt</span>. This is a boast of the opposite nature. In Judæa the trouble might be that there was too little water. In Egypt there would be too much. But as in the former case the Assyrian could surmount all difficulties, so he had but to march into Egypt, and at his approach the Nile should be dried up and make a way for his troops to pass. The change of tense in the verb is necessary from the Hebrew, and the language is the proud king’s way of saying ‘As soon as I have reduced Jerusalem, I will pass on to Egypt and win that land too’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word translated ‘rivers’ is the Heb. ‘Yeor’ and is a proper name of the Nile. See R.V. <a href="/genesis/41-1.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.">Genesis 41:1</a> margin. It is translated ‘Nile’ in R.V. of <a href="/isaiah/19-7.htm" title="The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.">Isaiah 19:7</a>, three times over. Also the word rendered ‘besieged places’ is the Hebrew ‘Mazor’ another form for ‘Mizraim’ the common word for ‘Egypt’, ‘Mazor’ is translated ‘Egypt’ in R.V. both here and in <a href="/isaiah/19-6.htm" title="And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defense shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.">Isaiah 19:6</a>, and <a href="/micah/7-12.htm" title="In that day also he shall come even to you from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.">Micah 7:12</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have digged and drunk strange waters</span>; rather, perhaps, I <span class="accented">dig</span>, <span class="accented">and drink</span>... <span class="accented">and dry</span> up - the preterit having again a present sense. Sennacherib means that this is what he is wont to do. As mountains do not stop him (ver. 23), so deserts do not stop him - he digs wells in them, and drinks water "strange" to the soil - never before seen there. <span class="cmt_word">And with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">will</span> 1 <span class="accented">dry up all the rivers of Egypt</span> (compare the Revised Version. "Mazor" is used for "Egypt" in <a href="/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a> and <a href="/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). It is the old singular from which was formed the dual Mizraim. Whether it meant "land of strength" (Pusey), or "land of distress" (Ewald), may be doubted, since we have no right to assume a Hebrew derivation. There was probably a native word, from which the Hebrew <span class="accented">Mazor</span>, the Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span> were taken. Sennacherib's beast is that, as he makes deserts traversable by digging wells, so, if rivers try to stop him, he will find a way of drying them up. Compare the boasts of Alaric in Claudian ('Bell. Get.,' pp. 525-532), who had probably this passage of Kings in his thoughts - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"To patior suadente fugam, cum cesserit omnis<br />Obsequiis natura meis?<br />Subsidere nostris Sub pedibus montes, arescere vidimus amnes<br />Fregi Alpes, galeisque Padum victricibus hausi."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the challenge, to observe the blasphemies of Sennacherib, Hezekiah mentions the fact that the Assyrians have really devastated all lands, and therefore that it is not without ground that they boast of their mighty power; but he finds the explanation of this in the impotence and nothingness of the gods of the heathen. &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;, truly, indeed - the kings of Asshur have devastated the nations and their land. Instead of this we find in Isaiah: "they have devastated all lands and their (own) land" - which is evidently the more difficult and also the more original reading, and has been altered in our account, because the thought that the Assyrians had devastated their own land by making war upon other lands, that is to say, had depopulated it and thereby laid it waste, was not easy to understand. "And have cast their gods into the fire, for they are not gods, but works of human hands, wood and stone, and have thus destroyed them." Hezekiah does not mention this as a sign of the recklessness of the Assyrians (Knobel), but, because Sennacherib had boasted that the gods of no nation had been able to resist him (vv. 12, 13), to put this fact in the right light, and attach thereto the prayer that Jehovah, by granting deliverance, would make known to all the kingdoms of the earth that He alone was God. Instead of &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; we have in Isaiah &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503;, the inf. absol.; in this connection the more difficult and more genuine reading. This also applies to the omission of &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="/2_kings/19-19.htm">2 Kings 19:19</a>) in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-20.htm">Isaiah 37:20</a>, since the use of Jehovah as a predicate, "that Thou alone art Jehovah," is very rare, and has therefore been misunderstood even by Gesenius. By the introduction of Elohim, the thought "that Thou Jehovah art God alone" is simplified. </body></html>
