Those who speak from God to us, we should in a particular manner desire to speak to God for us. The great Prophet is the great Intercessor. Those are likely to prevail with God, who lift up their hearts in prayer. Man's extremity is God's opportunity. While his servants can speak nothing but terror to the profane, the proud, and the hypocritical, they have comfortable words for the discouraged believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hezekiah, like his officers, probably rent his clothes on account of Rab-shakeh's blasphemies: and he put on sackcloth in self-humiliation and in grief. The only hope left was in Yahweh, for Egypt could not be trusted to effect anything of importance. Rab-shakeh's boldness had told upon Hezekiah. He was dispirited and dejected. He perhaps began to doubt whether he had done right in yielding to the bolder counsels of Eliakim and Isaiah. He had not lost his faith in God; but his faith was being severely tried. He wisely went and strove by prayer to strengthen it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 19<p>2Ki 19:1-5.

The expression in which the message was conveyed described, by a strong figure, the desperate condition of the kingdom, together with their own inability to help themselves; and it intimated also a hope, that the blasphemous defiance of Jehovah's power by the impious Assyrian might lead to some direct interposition for the vindication of His honor and supremacy to all heathen gods.Hezekiah acquainteth Isaiah the prophet with the blasphemies of Rab-shakeh: he promiseth deliverance from the Lord, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD....">2 Kings 19:1-7</a></span>.

The report of Rabshakeh's speech, recorded in the preceding chapter: <p>that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth; rent his clothes because of the blasphemy in the speech; and he put on sackcloth, in token of mourning, for the calamities he feared were coming on him and his people: and he went into the house of the Lord; the temple, to pray unto him. The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/context/2_kings/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD....">2 Kings 19:1-7</a>.

The king was struck with horror as much as his counsellors. But he feels that he has in his council one who has long been known as God’s messenger to Judah. So while he himself falls to humiliation and prayer, going for that purpose into the house of the Lord, he sends his servants to enquire of the prophet what hope there is amid the terrible attack which may very soon be upon them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes</span> - following the example of his chief officers, who came into his presence "with their clothes rent" (see <a href="/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and covered himself with sackcloth.</span> A sign of grief and self-humiliation (comp. <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-31.htm">1 Kings 20:31</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>, etc.).

The imperative &#1493;&#1506;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; expresses the consequence of what goes before (vid., Ewald, 347, b.). To eat his vine and fig-tree and to drink the water of his well is a figure denoting the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of his own possession (cf. <a href="/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a>). Even in the event of their yielding, the Assyrian would transport the Jewish people into another land, according to the standing custom of Asiatic conquerors in ancient times (for proofs see Hengstenberg, De rebus Tyriis, pp. 51, 52). To make the people contented with this thought, the boaster promised that the king of Assyria would carry them into a land which was quite as fruitful and glorious as the land of Canaan. The description of it as a land with corn and new wine, etc., recalls the picture of the land of Canaan in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>. &#1497;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512; &#1494;&#1497;&#1514; is the olive-tree which yields good oil, in distinction from the wild olive-tree. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;: and ye shall live and not die, i.e., no harm shall befall you from me (Thenius).
