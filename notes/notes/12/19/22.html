God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory.

Then Isaiah &#8230; sent&#8212;A revelation having been made to Isaiah, the prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The prophetic message consisted of three different portions:&#8212;First, Sennacherib is apostrophized (2Ki 19:21-28) in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot. Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed (2Ki 19:29-31), and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance&#8212;namely, that for two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is announced (2Ki 19:32-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Exalted thy voice; </span> by Rab-shakeh, who <span class="ital">cried with a loud voice</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/18-28.htm" title="Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:">2 Kings 18:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lifted up thine eyes on high; </span> a gesture of pride and scornfulness, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/proverbs/21-4.htm" title="An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.">Proverbs 21:4</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against the Holy One of Israel:</span> not against man, but against the holy God, who will not suffer thy impious blasphemies to go unpunished; and against the <span class="ital">Holy One of Israel</span>, who hath a special relation and kindness to Israel, having as it were set himself apart for them, and set them apart for himself, as being at this time the God of the Jews only, and not the God of the Gentiles; whom, as yet, he suffered to walk in their own evil ways, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/acts/14-16.htm" title="Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.">Acts 14:16</a></span>.

The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted <i>thy</i> voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? <i>even</i> <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> against the Holy <i>One</i> of Israel.</span><p>(o) God counts that as an injury done to him, and will avenge what is done to any of his saints.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">and lift</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">lifted</span>] <span class="ital">up thine eyes on high</span>] The name by which Jehovah is often called is ‘the Most High’ (cf. <a href="/psalms/56-2.htm" title="My enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O you most High.">Psalm 56:2</a>).

The plural &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; by the side of the singular &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1498; is the correct reading, since the expression "to incline the ear" is constantly met with (<a href="/psalms/17-6.htm">Psalm 17:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-11.htm">Psalm 45:11</a>, etc.); and even in the plural, "incline ye your ear" (<a href="/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>), and on the other hand "to open the eyes" (<a href="/job/27-19.htm">Job 27:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-13.htm">Proverbs 20:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>), because a man always opens both eyes to see anything, whereas he turns one ear to a person speaking. The &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1498; of Isaiah is also plural, though written defectively, as the Masora has already observed. The suffix in &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;, which is wanting in Isaiah, belongs to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and refers with this to &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; in the sense of speech: the speech which Sennacherib had made in his letter.</body></html>
