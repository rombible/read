God himself undertakes to defend the city; and that person, that place, cannot but be safe, which he undertakes to protect. The invasion of the Assyrians probably had prevented the land from being sown that year. The next is supposed to have been the sabbatical year, but the Lord engaged that the produce of the land should be sufficient for their support during those two years. As the performance of this promise was to be after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, it was a sign to Hezekiah's faith, assuring him of that present deliverance, as an earnest of the Lord's future care of the kingdom of Judah. This the Lord would perform, not for their righteousness, but his own glory.

Then Isaiah &#8230; sent&#8212;A revelation having been made to Isaiah, the prophet announced to the king that his prayer was heard. The prophetic message consisted of three different portions:&#8212;First, Sennacherib is apostrophized (2Ki 19:21-28) in a highly poetical strain, admirably descriptive of the turgid vanity, haughty pretensions, and presumptuous impiety of the Assyrian despot. Secondly, Hezekiah is addressed (2Ki 19:29-31), and a sign is given him of the promised deliverance&#8212;namely, that for two years the presence of the enemy would interrupt the peaceful pursuits of husbandry, but in the third year the people would be in circumstances to till their fields and vineyards and reap the fruits as formerly. Thirdly, the issue of Sennacherib's invasion is announced (2Ki 19:32-34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The virgin; </span> so he calls Zion, or Jerusalem; partly, because she was pure in good measure from that gross idolatry wherewith other people were defiled, which is called spiritual whoredom; partly, to signify that God would defend her from that rape which Sennacherib intended to commit upon her, with no less care and zeal than parents do their virgin daughters from those who seek to force and deflour them; and partly, to intimate, that as she had not yet been forced and taken by her barbarous enemies, so she should still retain her virginity, in spite of his attempts against her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The daughter of Zion, </span> i.e. the people of Zion, i.e. as it follows, of Jerusalem; so called synecdochically from the mountain and city of Zion, which was an eminent part of it.

Jerusalem is called ‘daughter of Sion’ because her inhabitants may be counted poetically as the offspring of Sion. She is also called ‘virgin’ because hitherto, since David’s time, when the chosen people first obtained complete possession of the place, it had never been conquered. And by opening the prophecy with this word it seems to be foretold that it shall still he saved from conquest. Some have preferred to take the three words as all in apposition, rendering ‘The virgin-daughter Sion’, with much the same sense. In the original the first two words are both in the construct form, but instances are found of such forms standing as if only in apposition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The daughter of Jerusalem</span>] i.e. The people dwelling in the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath shaken her head at thee</span>] This was a gesture of scorn.

It adds great liveliness and force to the opening portion of the oracle, that it should be addressed directly by Jehovah to Sennacherib, as an answer to his bold challenge. The only address at all similar in Scripture is that to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31, 32</a>), spoken by "a voice from heaven" But the present passage is one of far greater force and beauty. <span class="cmt_word">The virgin the daughter of Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the virgin daughter of Zion</span>, or <span class="accented">the virgin daughter</span>, <span class="accented">Zion</span>. Cities were commonly personified by the sacred writers, and represented as "daughters" (see <a href="/isaiah/23-10.htm">Isaiah 23:10, 12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>, etc.). "Virgin daughter" here may perhaps represent "the consciousness of impregnability" (Drechsler); but the phrase seems to have been used rhetorically or poetically, to heighten the beauty or pathos of the picture (<a href="/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>), without any reference to the question whether the particular city had or had not been previously taken. Jerusalem certainly had been taken by Shishak (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>), and by   Joash (<a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>); but Zion, if it be taken as the name of the eastern city (Bishop Patrick, <span class="accented">ad</span> lee.), may have been still a "virgin fortress." <span class="cmt_word">Hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn</span>; or, <span class="accented">despises thee and laughs thee to scorn</span>. The Hebrew preterite has often a present sense. Whatever was the case a little while ago (see <a href="/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1-14</a>), the city now laughs at thy threats. <span class="cmt_word">The daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee</span>; or, <span class="accented">wags her head at thee - in</span> scorn and ridicule (comp. <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In opposition to the delusion of the Assyrians, he describes Jehovah, the God of Israel, as the only God of all the kingdoms of the earth, since He was the Creator of heaven and earth. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; (see at <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a> and <a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>) indicates the covenant-relation into which Jehovah, the almighty Creator and Ruler of the whole world, had entered towards Israel. As the covenant God who was enthroned above the cherubim the Lord was bound to help His people, if they turned to Him with faith in the time of their distress and entreated His assistance; and as the only God of all the world He had the power to help. In Isaiah, &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, which is very rare in historical prose, but very common in prophetical addresses, is added to the name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, and thus Jehovah at the very outset is addressed as the God of the universe.
