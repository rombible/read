The message he sent to Isaiah, with his answer, and the threatening letter of the king of Assyria, Hezekiah's prayer upon it, and the encouraging answer he had from the Lord, with the account of the destruction of the Assyrian army, and the death of Sennacherib, are the same "verbatim" as in <a href="/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a> throughout; and therefore the reader is referred thither for the exposition of them; only would add what Rauwolff (t) observes, that still to this day (1575) there are two great holes to be seen, wherein they flung the dead bodies (of the Assyrian army), one whereof is close by the road towards Bethlehem, the other towards the right hand against old Bethel. <p>(t) Travels, par. 3. ch. 22. p. 317. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, I will send a blast <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span><p>(d) The Lord can with one blast blow away all the strength of man, and turn it into dust.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Behold, I will send a blast upon him</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">put a spirit in him</span>. ‘Blast’ in this verse is often wrongly accepted as referring to the destroying angel of verse 35 below. The true sense is represented in R.V. God would give to Sennacherib and his soldiers such an inward motion or impulse that the news which should be brought to them should alarm them and drive them away. We know from Saul’s history how an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.">1 Samuel 16:14</a>). In another wise there should come a troubling spirit upon the Assyrians, which should make them ready to take alarm at anything. This is the sense of the LXX. <span class="greekheb">δίδωμι ἐν αὐτῷ πνεῦμα</span>. But the word for ‘spirit’ and for ‘wind’ being the same in both Hebrew and Greek some interpreters have thought that the allusion is to the blast, sound or noise which would bring the rumour alluded to in the next words. But this sense seems less likely than the former, and finds no illustration elsewhere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and he shall hear a rumour</span>] Probably refers to the report about the Ethiopian king, Tirhakah, spoken of presently, in verse 9 as on the march to meet Sennacherib. The answer of the prophet does not speak of the destruction of the host, an event which more than anything else hastened Sennacherib’s departure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shall return to his own land</span>] See below verse 36.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will cause him to fall</span>] Though the whole manner of God’s intervention be not made known, enough is laid open to shew us that to the boastful Sennacherib God had already fixed his day. The two sons (verse 37) are the instruments, but they, though they know it not, are only working out God’s design.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will send a blast upon him.</span> The meaning is doubtful. Most modern critics translate, with the LXX., "I will put a spirit within him," and understand "a spirit of cowardice," or "a despondent mood" (Thenius), or "an extraordinary impulse of Divine inspiration, which is to hurry him blindly on" (Drechsler). But the idea of our translators, that the blast (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) is external, and sent <span class="accented">upon</span> him, not put in him - that, in fact, the destruction of his army is referred to, seems defensible by such passages as <a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>. The prophecy was, no doubt, intentionally vague - enough for its immediate purpose, which was to comfort and strengthen Hezekiah - but not intended to gratify man's curiosity by revealing the exact mode in which God would work. <span class="cmt_word">And he shall hear a rumor</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">shall hear a hearsay</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be told something, which shall determine him on a hasty retreat. It is best, I think, to understand, not news of Tirhakah's advance (Knobel, Keil, Bahr), much less news of an insurrection in some other part of the empire (Cheyne), but information of the disaster to his army. It is no objection to this that Sennacherib was "with his army." No doubt he was. But he would learn the catastrophe from the mouth of some one who came into his tent and told him - he would "hear a hearsay" <span class="cmt_word">And shall return to his own land</span> (see ver. 36), <span class="cmt_word">and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> (On Sennacherib's murder, see the comment upon ver. 37.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Hezekiah had heard from his counsellors the report of Rabshakeh's words, he rent his clothes with horror at his daring mockery of the living God (<a href="/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>), put on mourning clothes as a sign of the trouble of his soul and went into the temple, and at the same time sent Eliakim and Shebna with the oldest of the priests in mourning costume to the prophet Isaiah, to entreat him to intercede with the Lord in these desperate circumstances.<p>(Note: "But the most wise king did not meet his blasphemies with weapons, but with prayer, and tears, and sackcloth, and entreated the prophet Isaiah to be his ambassador." - Theodoret.)<p>The order of the words: Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, is unusual (cf. <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>, etc.), and is therefore altered in Isaiah into Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet. </body></html>
