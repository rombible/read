Those best honour their Bibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by that light. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and must provide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah let Josiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem. The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled, but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, are least likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle, yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such persons suffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Went unto Huldah - It might have been expected that the royal commissioners would have gone to Jeremiah, on whom the prophetic spirit had descended in Josiah's 13th year <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>, or five years previous to the finding of the Law.

But at the same time the king was consoled with an assurance that this season of punishment and sorrow should not be during his lifetime, on account of the faith, penitence, and pious zeal for the divine glory and worship which, in his public capacity and with his royal influence, he had displayed.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she said unto them,....

The word of the Lord comes to Huldah with the arrival of the messengers, or perhaps previous to it, and she is at once ready with her reply. It divides itself into two parts. In vers. 15-17 the inquiry made is answered - answered affirmatively, "Yes, the fiat is gone forth; it is too late to avert the sentence; the anger of the Lord is kindled, and <span class="accented">shall not be quenched</span>." After this, in vers. 18-20, a special message is sent to the king, granting him an arrest of judgment, on account of his self-humiliation and abasement. "Because his heart was tender, and he had humbled himself before Jehovah, the evil should not happen in his day." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel.</span> Huldah is the only example of a prophetess in Israel, who seems to rank on the same footing with the prophets. Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>), Isaiah s wife (<a href="/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and Anna (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) are called "prophetesses," but in a secondary sense, as holy women, having a certain gift of song or prediction from God. Huldah has the full prophetic afflatus, and delivers God's oracles, just as Isaiah and Jeremiah do. The case is a remarkable exception to the general rule that women should "keel) silence in the Churches." <span class="cmt_word">Tell the man that sent you to me.</span> The contrast between this unceremonious phrase and that used in ver. 18 is best explained by Thenius, who says, "In the first part Huldah has only the subject-matter in mind, while in ver. 18, in the quieter flow of her words, she takes notice of the state of mind of the particular person who sent to make the inquiry." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The reading of the book of the law to the king, and the inquiry made of the prophetess Huldah concerning it. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-9.htm">2 Kings 22:9</a>, <a href="/2_kings/22-10.htm">2 Kings 22:10</a>. When Shaphan informed the king of the execution of his command, he also told him that Hilkiah had given him a book, and read it to the king. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to bring an answer, to give a report as to a commission that has been received. &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, they poured out the money, i.e., out of the chest in which it was collected, into bags. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, "he read it to the king," is simplified in the Chronicles (<a href="/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18</a>) by &#1489;&#1493; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, "he read therein." That &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493; does not signify that the whole was read, is evident from a comparison of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>, where the reading of the whole is expressed by &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; &#1505;. Which passages or sections Shaphan read by himself (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>), and which he read to the king, it is impossible to determine exactly. To the king he most likely read, among other things, the threats and curses of the law against those who transgressed it (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>), and possibly also <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, because the reading made such an impression upon him, that in his anguish of soul he rent his clothes. Nor is it possible to decide anything with certainty, as to whether the king had hitherto been altogether unacquainted with the book of the law, and had merely a traditional knowledge of the law itself, or whether he had already had a copy of the law, but had not yet read it through, or had not read it with proper attention, which accounted for the passages that were read to him now making so deep and alarming an impression upon him. It is a well-known experience, that even books which have been read may, under peculiar circumstances, produce an impression such as has not been made before. But in all probability Josiah had not had in his possession any copy of the law, or even read it till now; although the thorough acquaintance with the law, which all the prophets display, places the existence of the Pentateuch in prophetical circles beyond the reach of doubt. </body></html>
