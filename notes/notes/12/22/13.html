Those best honour their Bibles, who study them; daily feed on that bread, and walk by that light. Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this inquiry, What shall we do to be saved? Also, what we may expect, and must provide for. Those who are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath, cannot but be very anxious how they may be saved. Huldah let Josiah know what judgments God had in store for Judah and Jerusalem. The generality of the people were hardened, and their hearts unhumbled, but Josiah's heart was tender. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he humbled himself before the Lord. Those who most fear God's wrath, are least likely to feel it. Though Josiah was mortally wounded in battle, yet he died in peace with God, and went to glory. Whatever such persons suffer or witness, they are gathered to the grave in peace, and shall enter into the rest which remaineth for the people of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Enquire of the Lord - As inquiry by Urim and Thummim had ceased - apparently because superseded by prophecy - this order was equivalent to an injunction to seek the presence of a prophet (compare <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5</a>).<p>Because our fathers have not hearkened - Josiah, it will be observed, assumes that preceding generations had had full opportunity of hearing and knowing the Law.

The officers, therefore, understood the king to mean that they were to seek out a prophet (see ver. 14), and so make the inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">And for the people, and for all Judah</span> - the threats read in the king's ears were probably those of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a> or <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16-39</a>, which extended to the whole people - <span class="cmt_word">concerning the words of this book that is found.</span> Not "whether they are authentic, whether they are really the words of Moses" (Duneker), for of that Josiah appears to have had no doubt; but whether they are words that are to have an immediate fulfillment, "whether," as Yon Gerlach says, "the measure of sin is already full, or whether there is yet hope of grace?" (compare Huldah's answer in vers. 16-20, which shows what she understood the king's inquiry to be). <span class="cmt_word">For great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us.</span> Josiah recognized that Judah had done, and was still doing, exactly those things against which the threatenings of the Law were directed - bad forsaken Jehovah and gone after other gods, and made to themselves high places, and set up images, and done after the customs of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before them. He could not, therefore, doubt but that the wrath of the Lord "was kindled;" but would it blaze forth at once? <span class="cmt_word">Because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.</span> Josiah assumes that their fathers have had the book, and might have known its words, either because he conceives that it had not been very long lost, or because he regards them as having possessed other copies. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Repairing of the temple, and discovery of the book of the law (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8-18</a>). - When Josiah sent Shaphan the secretary of state (&#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>) into the temple, in the eighteenth year of his reign, with instructions to Hilkiah the high priest to pay to the builders the money which had been collected from the people for repairing the temple by the Levites who kept the door, Hilkiah said to Shaphan, "I have found the book of the law." <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3-8</a> form a long period. The apodosis to &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, "it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah-the king had sent Shaphan," etc., does not follow till <a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a> : "that Hilkiah said," etc. The principal fact which the historian wished to relate, was the discovery of the book of the law; and the repairing of the temple is simply mentioned because it was when Shaphan was sent to Hilkiah about the payment of the money to the builders that the high priest informed the king's secretary of state of the discovery of the book of the law in the temple, and handed it over to him to take to the king. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>, forms the commencement to the minor clauses inserted within the principal clause, and subordinate to it: "the king had sent Shaphan," etc. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm">2 Chronicles 34:8</a>, the king had deputed not only Shaphan the state-secretary, but also Maaseiah the governor of the city and Joach the chancellor, because the repairing of the temple was not a private affair of the king and the high priest, but concerned the city generally, and indeed the whole kingdom. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4</a>, <a href="/2_kings/22-5.htm">2 Kings 22:5</a> there follows the charge given by the king to Shaphan: "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may make up the money, ... and hand it over to the workmen appointed over the house of Jehovah," etc. &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, Hiphil, signifies to finish or set right, i.e., not pay out (Ges., Dietr.), but make it up for the purpose of paying out, namely, collect it from the door-keepers, count it, and bind it up in bags (see <a href="/2_kings/12-11.htm">2 Kings 12:11</a>). &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is therefore quite appropriate here, and there is no alteration of the text required. The door-keepers had probably put the money in a chest placed at the entrance, as was the case at the repairing of the temple in the time of Joash (<a href="/2_kings/12-10.htm">2 Kings 12:10</a>). In <a href="/2_kings/22-5.htm">2 Kings 22:5</a> the Keri &#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is a bad alteration of the Chethb &#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;, "and give (it) into the hand," which is perfectly correct. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; might denote both the masters and the workmen (builders), and is therefore defined more precisely first of all by &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, "who had the oversight at the house of Jehovah," i.e., the masters or inspectors of the building, and secondly by &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, who were (occupied) at the house of Jehovah, whilst in the Chronicles it is explained by &#1497; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;.
