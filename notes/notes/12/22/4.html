His character was most excellent. Had the people joined in the reformation as heartily as he persevered in it, blessed effects would have followed. But they were wicked, and had become fools in idolatry. We do not obtain full knowledge of the state of Judah from the historical records, unless we refer to the writings of the prophets who lived at the time. In repairing the temple, the book of the law was found, and brought to the king. It seems, this book of the law was lost and missing; carelessly mislaid and neglected, as some throw their Bibles into corners, or maliciously concealed by some of the idolaters. God's care of the Bible plainly shows his interest in it. Whether this was the only copy in being or not, the things contained in it were new, both to the king and to the high priest. No summaries, extracts, or collections out of the Bible, can convey and preserve the knowledge of God and his will, like the Bible itself. It was no marvel that the people were so corrupt, when the book of the law was so scarce; they that corrupted them, no doubt, used arts to get that book out of their hands. The abundance of Bibles we possess aggravates our national sins; for what greater contempt of God can we show, than to refuse to read his word when put into our hands, or, reading it, not to believe and obey it? By the holy law is the knowledge of sin, and by the blessed gospel is the knowledge of salvation. When the former is understood in its strictness and excellence, the sinner begins to inquire, What must I do to be saved? And the ministers of the gospel point out to him Jesus Christ, as the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hilkiah - Hilkiah was the father (or grandfather) of Seraiah (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-13.htm">1 Chronicles 6:13-14</a>, with <a href="/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>), high priest at the time of the captivity <a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>. and ancestor of Ezra the scribe <a href="/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1</a>.<p>It is evident from the expressions of this verse that a collection for the repairs of the temple, similar to that established in the reign of Joash <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9-10</a>, had been for some considerable time in progress (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>), and the king now sent to know the result. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 22:3-7.

The preliminary steps had been already taken; not only the builders were employed, but money had been brought by all the people and received by the Levites at the door, and various other preparations had been made. But the course of this narrative turns on one interesting incident which happened in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, and hence that date is specified. In fact the whole land was thoroughly purified from every object and all traces of idolatry. The king now addressed himself to the repair and embellishment of the temple and gave directions to Hilkiah the high priest to take a general survey, in order to ascertain what was necessary to be done (see on [353]2Ch 34:8-15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That he may sum the silver, </span> i.e. take an exact account how much it is, and then dispose it in manner following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The keepers of the door</span> were priests or Levites, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm" title="But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.">2 Kings 12:9</a> <a href="/2_chronicles/8-14.htm" title="And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.">2 Chronicles 8:14</a> 23:4 34:9</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Go up to Hilkiah the high priest,....

With a view to a restoration of the temple, a collection of money like that in the reign of Joash (see above, chap. 12.) had been in progress, and now, acting on the precedent of that previous time, as appears from the great similarity in the language used to describe them both, Josiah sets about the repair of all that had fallen into decay during the seven and fifty years which had passed since the death of Hezekiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the keepers of the door have gathered of the people</span>] The keepers of the door were the priests (see <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm" title="But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.">2 Kings 12:9</a>) who had charge of the treasury into which the offerings of the devout were put.
