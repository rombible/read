The temple was out of repair; Jehoash orders the repair of the temple. The king was zealous. God requires those who have power, to use it for the support of religion, the redress of grievances, and repairing of decays. The king employed the priests to manage, as most likely to be hearty in the work. But nothing was done effectually till the twenty-third year of his reign. Another method was therefore taken. When public distributions are made faithfully, public contributions will be made cheerfully. While they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did not break in upon the stated maintenance of the priests. Let not the servants of the temple be starved, under colour of repairing the breaches of it. Those that were intrusted did the business carefully and faithfully. They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, till the other work was completed; hence we may learn, in all our expenses, to prefer that which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we would for ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The worship on the "high places" seems to have continued uninterruptedly to the time of Hezekiah, who abolished it <a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>.

We must remember that it was Jehovah who was worshipped in the "high places," not Baal, or Moloch, or Ashtoreth (see the comment on <a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</span> The people, not the king, in the earlier portion of his reign; but in the later portion, probably the king also (see <a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17, 18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Renewal of the covenant, extermination of the worship of Baal, and entrance of the king into the palace. - <a href="/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>. After Jehoash was crowned and Athaliah put to death, Jehoiada concluded the covenant (1) between Jehovah on the one hand and the king and people on the other, and (2) between the king and the people. The former was simply a renewal of the covenant which the Lord had made with Israel through Moses (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>), whereby the king and the people bound themselves &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1501; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., to live as the people of the Lord, or to keep His law (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-9.htm">Deuteronomy 27:9-10</a>), and was based upon the "testimony" handed to the king. This covenant naturally led to the covenant between the king and the people, whereby the king bound himself to rule his people according to the law of the Lord, and the people vowed that they would be obedient and subject to the king as the ruler appointed by the Lord (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>). The renewal of the covenant with the Lord was necessary, because under the former kings the people had fallen away from the Lord and served Baal. The immediate consequence of the renewal of the covenant, therefore, was the extermination of the worship of Baal, which is mentioned at once in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, although its proper place in order of time is after <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>. All the people (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;, as in <a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>) went to the temple of Baal, threw down his altars, broke his images (the columns of Baal and Astarte) rightly, i.e., completely (&#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489; as in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>), and slew the priest Mattan, probably the chief priest of Baal, before his altars. That the temple of Baal stood within the limits of the sanctuary, i.e., of the temple of Jehovah (Thenius), cannot be shown to be probable either from <a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a> or from the last clause of this verse. (For <a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a> see the fuller remarks on <a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>.) The words "and the priest set overseers over the house of Jehovah" do not affirm that Jehoiada created the office of overseer over the temple for the purpose of guarding against a fresh desecration of the temple by idolatry (Thenius), but simply that he appointed overseers over the temple, namely, priests and Levites entrusted with the duty of watching over the performance of worship according to the precepts of the law, as is more minutely described in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, <a href="/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>. </body></html>
