When we see what a sad conclusion there was to so promising a beginning, it ought to make us seek into our spiritual declinings. If we know any thing of Christ as the foundation of our faith and hope, let us desire to know nothing but Christ. May the work of the blessed Spirit on our souls be manifest; may we see, feel, and be earnest, in seeking after Jesus in all his fulness, suitableness, and grace, that our souls may be brought over from dead works to serve the living and true God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A conspiracy - Compare the marginal reference Joash, either from a suspicion of intended treason, or from some other unknown cause, took up his abode in the fortress of Millo <a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>. This conspiracy was connected with religion. Soon after the death of Jehoiada, Joash had apostatised; had renewed the worship of Baal; and, despite of many prophetic warnings, had persisted in his evil courses, even commanding Zechariah to be slain when he rebuked them <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-18.htm">2 Chronicles 24:18-27</a>. The conspirators, who wished to avenge Zechariah, no doubt wished also to put down the Baal worship. In this it appears that they succeeded. For, though Amaziah punished the actual murderers after a while <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a>, yet he appears not to have been a Baal-worshipper. The only idolatries laid to his charge are the maintenance of the high places <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>, and a worship of the gods of Edom <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14-20</a>.<p>Silla - This place is quite unknown. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. his servants arose &#8230; and slew Joash in the house of Millo&#8212;(See on [339]2Ch 24:25).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Jozachar, </span> called also <span class="ital">Zabad</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/24-26.htm" title="And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.">2 Chronicles 24:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">Silomer</span>, called <span class="ital">Shimrith</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/24-26.htm" title="And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.">2 Chronicles 24:26</a></span>; except Shomer be the father’s name, and Shimrith the mother’s. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With his fathers, </span> i.e. in the same city, but not in the same royal sepulchre, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm" title="And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.">2 Chronicles 24:25</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For Jozachar the son of Shimeath,....

Between <span class="greekheb">זבד</span> Zabad and <span class="greekheb">זכר</span> Zacar, the abbreviated form of Jozacar, it is easy to see how a mistake might arise from the similarity of the Hebrew letters. The Chronicler who mentions the nationality of the mothers gives their names both in the feminine form. In Kings the last two letters from <span class="greekheb">שׁמרית</span> (Shemrith) have fallen out and so the name has become <span class="greekheb">שׁמר</span> (Shomer). Although these names are without doubt historical it is very remarkable (as Thenius points out) how when they are translated they recall Zechariah’s last words ‘The Lord look upon it and require it’. For they signify ‘<span class="ital">Jehovah-remembers</span>’, the son of ‘<span class="ital">Hearer;</span>’ and ‘<span class="ital">Jehovah-gives</span>’, the son of ‘<span class="ital">Watcher</span>’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and they buried him with his fathers</span>] i.e. In the city of David, but as the Chronicler records, not in the sepulchres of the kings. The words of the Chronicler about the ‘greatness of the burdens’ laid upon Jehoash refers to the many prophetic oracles which were uttered against him in consequence of his evil deeds. Cf. for that sense of the word ‘burden’ <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1</a>, and many other passages of that prophet. On the margin R.V. in such cases, gives ‘oracle concerning’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Amaziah his son</span>] The Chronicler (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-27.htm" title="Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.">2 Chronicles 24:27</a>) speaks of the ‘<span class="ital">sons</span> of Jehoash’; we know nothing however of any son but Amaziah, though it is said (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-3.htm" title="And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.">2 Chronicles 24:3</a>) ‘Jehoiada took for Jehoash two wives, and he begat sons and daughters’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Jozachar the son of Shimeath</span>; called in Chronicles "Zabad," probably through a corruption of the text.
