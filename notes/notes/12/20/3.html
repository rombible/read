When we reflect on this, we need not be surprised at the sorrow which this good king expressed at his approaching dissolution. He looked upon it as a punishment, and consequently as a mark of the divine displeasure. Other reasons too might strongly operate upon a good mind. The suddenness of this terrible and unexpected denunciation; the unsettled state both of his public and domestic affairs; and the natural dread of death inherent in the human mind, which might in this case possibly be augmented from a sense of his own defects, and from a thorough persuasion that God was displeased at him, by cutting him off in such a manner, in the very flower of his age, and when his kingdom and family particularly required his best assistance. However, be the reasons what they might, it behooves us certainly to judge with great candour of a prince, whose character is so good as that of Hezekiah: and, perhaps, blessed as we are, with a clearer knowledge of a future state than Hezekiah enjoyed, there are but few who can look upon death, awful as it is even to the best, without some degree of very serious concern.” — Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-11 Hezekiah was sick unto death, in the same year in which the king of Assyria besieged Jerusalem. A warning to prepare for death was brought to Hezekiah by Isaiah. Prayer is one of the best preparations for death, because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God, to enable us to finish well. He wept sorely: some gather from hence that he was unwilling to die; it is in the nature of man to dread the separation of soul and body. There was also something peculiar in Hezekiah's case; he was now in the midst of his usefulness. Let Hezekiah's prayer, see Isa 38. interpret his tears; in that is nothing which is like his having been under that fear of death, which has bondage or torment. Hezekiah's piety made his sick-bed easy. O Lord, remember now; he does not speak as if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us; nor, as if the reward might be demanded as due; it is Christ's righteousness only that is the purchase of mercy and grace. Hezekiah does not pray, Lord, spare me; but, Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me be thine. God always hears the prayers of the broken in heart, and will give health, length of days, and temporal deliverances, as much and as long as is truly good for them. Means were to be used for Hezekiah's recovery; yet, considering to what a height the disease was come, and how suddenly it was checked, the cure was miraculous. It is our duty, when sick, to use such means as are proper to help nature, else we do not trust God, but tempt him. For the confirmation of his faith, the shadow of the sun was carried back, and the light was continued longer than usual, in a miraculous manner. This work of wonder shows the power of God in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes of prayer, and the great favour he bears to his chosen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember now - The old covenant promised temporal prosperity, including length of days, to the righteous.

According to the highest standard of morality revealed up to this time, there was nothing unseemly in the self vindication of the monarch, which has many parallels in the Psalms of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3-10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19-26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1-8</a>, etc.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. remember now how I have walked before thee, &c.&#8212;The course of Hezekiah's thoughts was evidently directed to the promise made to David and his successors on the throne (1Ki 8:25). He had kept the conditions as faithfully as human infirmity admitted; and as he had been all along free from any of those great crimes by which, through the judgment of God, human life was often suddenly cut short, his great grief might arise partly from the love of life, partly from the obscurity of the Mosaic dispensation, where life and immortality had not been fully brought to light, and partly from his plans for the reformation of his kingdom being frustrated by his death. He pleaded the fulfilment of the promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In truth, </span> i.e. sincerely, with an honest mind, as the following words explain it.

The testimony which he himself bears to his own character appears to be generally true. He must have lived as a God-fearing son under an idolatrous father. When he came to the throne, while he had the work of purifying God’s worship in hand, and the Philistines were not driven out of Judah, he did all things well. But after some prosperous years he had himself to own to Sennacherib ‘I have offended’. During the war with Assyria he set a noble example. When the pressure was removed he gave way for a short time to pride and a boastful spirit. Moreover his care for his son’s training, if we may judge by Manasseh’s life when he became king, can hardly have been so zealous as we might expect from a father whose youth had been passed amid the difficulties of an idolatrous court. Altogether Hezekiah is one of those characters which shine brightest in adversity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart.</span> There is no Pharisaical self-righteousness here. Hezekiah is conscious that he has honestly endeavored to serve God, and to do his will - that, whatever may have been his shortcomings, his heart has been right towards God. He ventures, therefore, on something like expostulation. Why is he to be cut off in the midst of his days, at the age of thirty-nine, when such a wicked king as Uzziah has lived to be sixty-eight (<a href="/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>), and Rehoboam to be fifty-eight (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>)? It is to be remembered that, under the old covenant, length of days was expressly promised to the righteous (<a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-11.htm">Proverbs 9:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>, etc.), and that a shortened life was the proclaimed penalty of wicked-doing (<a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32, 33</a>; <a href="/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>). Hezekiah's self-assertion is thus a sort of laying hold of God's promises. <span class="cmt_word">And have done that which is flood in thy sight</span>; comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>; and note the similar pleadings of David, "<span class="accented">With my whole heart</span> have I sought thee" (<a href="/psalms/119-10.htm">Psalm 119:10</a>); "I have remembered thy Name, O Lord, and have <span class="accented">kept thy Law</span>. <span class="accented">This</span> I had because I kept thy commandments" (<a href="/psalms/119-55.htm">Psalm 119:55, 56</a>), and the like. <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah wept sore.</span> Human nature shrinks from death instinctively, and it requires a very vivid imagination for even the Christian in middle life to feel with St. Paul, that "it is better for him to depart and to be with Christ." The Hebrew of Hezekiah's time had far mere reason to regard death as an evil. His hopes of a life beyond the grave were feeble - his conceptions of the life, if life there were, faint and unattractive. <span class="accented">Sheol</span>, like Hades, was a vague, awful, terrible thing. If we consider Hezekiah's words, "The grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise thee" (<a href="/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>), we may understand how the Hebrew shrank from the fearful change. And in Hezekiah's case there was a yet further reason for grief Hezekiah had as yet no male offspring (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,'10:2. &sect; 1). Manasseh was as yet unborn (comp. ver. 6 with <a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). If he died now, his house would be cut off, he would be without posterity - a sore grief to every Hebrew. Ewald's references to <a href="/isaiah/38-19.htm">Isaiah 38:19</a> and Isaiah 39:7, as indicative of Hezekiah having sons at the time, are absolutely without value. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sign is followed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-30.htm">2 Kings 19:30</a>, <a href="/2_kings/19-31.htm">2 Kings 19:31</a> by the distinct promise of the deliverance of Judah and Jerusalem, for which Isaiah uses the sign itself as a type. "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again strike roots downwards and bear fruit upwards; for from Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and that which is escaped from Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah will do this." &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1505;&#1507;, to add roots, i.e., to strike fresh roots. The meaning is, that Judah will not succumb to this judgment. The remnant of the nation that has escaped from destruction by the Assyrians will once more grow and flourish vigorously; for from Jerusalem will a rescued remnant go forth. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; denotes those who have escaped destruction by the judgment (cf. <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.). The deliverance was attached to Jerusalem or to Mount Zion, not so much because the power of the Assyrians was to be destroyed before the gates of Jerusalem, as because of the greater importance which Jerusalem and Mount Zion, as the centre of the kingdom of God, the seat of the God-King, possessed in relation to the covenant-nation, so that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, it was thence that the Messianic salvation was also to proceed. This deliverance is traced to the zeal of the Lord on behalf of His people and against His foes (see at <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), like the coming of the Messiah in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> to establish an everlasting kingdom of peace and righteousness. The deliverance of Judah out of the power of Asshur was a prelude and type of the deliverance of the people of God by the Messiah out of the power of all that was ungodly. The &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; of Isaiah is omitted after &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, just as in <a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; though here it is supplied by the Masora as Keri. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a> Isaiah concludes by announcing that Sennacherib will not come to Jerusalem, nor even shoot at the city and besiege it, but will return disappointed, because the Lord will defend and save the city for the sake of His promise. The result of the whole prophecy is introduced with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;: therefore, because this is how the matter stands, viz., as explained in what precedes. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, with regard to the king, as in <a href="/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20</a>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, "he will not attack it with a shield," i.e., will not advance with shields to make an attack upon it. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; with a double accusative, as in <a href="/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. It only occurs here in a hostile sense: to come against, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>, i.e., to advance against a city, to storm it. The four clauses of the verse stand in a graduated relation to one another: not to take, not even to shoot at and attack, yea, not even to besiege the city, will he come. In <a href="/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> we have <a href="/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a> taken up again, and <a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a> is repeated in <a href="/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> for the purpose of strengthening the promise. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; we have in Isaiah &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;: "by which he has come." The perfect is actually more exact, and the imperfect may be explained from the fact that Sennacherib was at that very time advancing against Jerusalem. In <a href="/2_kings/19-34.htm">2 Kings 19:34</a> we have &#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; instead of the &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; of Isaiah: &#1506;&#1500; is more correct than &#1488;&#1500;. "For my sake," as Hezekiah had prayed in v. 19; and "for my servant David's sake," because Jehovah, as the unchangeably true One, must fulfil the promise which He gave to David (sees at <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). </body></html>
