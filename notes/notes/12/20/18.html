Hezekiah showed his treasures and armour, and other proofs of his wealth and power. This was the effect of pride and ostentation, and departing from simple reliance on God. He also seems to have missed the opportunity of speaking to the Chaldeans, about Him who had wrought the miracles which excited their attention, and of pointing out to them the absurdity and evil of idolatry. What is more common than to show our friends our houses and possessions? But if we do this in the pride of ours hearts, to gain applause from men, not giving praise to God, it becomes sin in us, as it did in Hezekiah. We may expect vexation from every object with which we are unduly pleased. Isaiah, who had often been Hezekiah's comforter, is now is reprover. The blessed Spirit is both, Joh 16:7,8. Ministers must be both, as there is occasion. Hezekiah allowed the justice of the sentence, and God's goodness in the respite. Yet the prospect respecting his family and nation must have given him many painful feelings. Hezekiah was indeed humbled for the pride of his heart. And blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; for they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This prophecy had two fulfillments, each complementary to the other.

But, after the destruction of Sennacherib, presents were brought him from various quarters, out of respect to a king who, by his faith and prayer, saved his country; and besides, it is by no means improbable that from the corpses in the Assyrian camp, all the gold and silver he had paid might be recovered. The vain display, however, was offensive to his divine liege lord, who sent Isaiah to reprove him. The answer he gave the prophet (2Ki 22:14) shows how he was elated by the compliment of their visit; but it was wrong, as presenting a bait for the cupidity of these rapacious foreigners, who, at no distant period, would return and pillage his country, and transfer all the possessions he ostentatiously displayed to Babylon, as well as his posterity to be court attendants in that country&#8212;(see on [349]2Ch 32:31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which thou shalt beget, </span> i.e. of thy grandchildren, who are oft called sons.

"At that time Berodach Baladan, king of Babel, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah, because he had heard that Hezekiah was sick." By &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; the arrival of these ambassadors is merely assigned in the most general manner to the period following Hezekiah's recovery. But from the object of their mission, it is evident that they did not arrive in Jerusalem till after the overthrow and departure of Sennacherib, and therefore at least half a year after Hezekiah's recovery. The ostensible reason given is, that Berodach Baladan had heard of Hezekiah's illness, and therefore sent to congratulate him on his recovery; but in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a> the further reason is mentioned, that he wished to inquire concerning the miracle upon the sun-dial. But, as Josephus has shown, the true object, no doubt, was to make sure of Hezekiah's friendship in anticipation of his intended revolt from the Assyrian rule. Berodach Baladan, for Merodach Baladan (Isa.), with the labial changed, is the same person as the Marodach Baladan who reigned in Babylon for six months, according to Alex. Polyhistor, or rather Berosus (Euseb. Chr. armen. i. pp. 42, 43), and was slain by Elibus, and also the same as the Mardokempad who reigned, according to the Can. Ptol., from 26 to 38 aer. Nab., i.e., from 721 to 709 b.c. The first part of the name, &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1498;, occurs in <a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a> in connection with Bel as the name of a Babylonian idol; and the whole name is found on a cylinder (in the British Museum) which contains the first expeditions of Sennacherib against Babylon and Media, and upon the inscriptions at Khorsabad spelt either Merodak-pal-dsana (according to Brandis, Ueber der Gewinn, pp. 44 and 53) or Marduk bal iddin (according to Oppert).<p>(Note: Compare M. v. Niebuhr, Gesch. Ass. p. 40; and with regard to the chronological differences, on account of which many have called in question the identity of Merodach Baladan either with the Marudach-Baladan of Berosus or with the Mardokempad of the Can. Ptol., see the discussion of this point at pp. 75ff.)<p>Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; we have &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; in Isaiah, which is not so clear, though it is probably more original; whereas the clause in Isaiah, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511; &#1495;&#1500;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "that he had been sick and had become strengthened, i.e., well again," is simply an elucidation of the &#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1495;&#1500;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; of our text, in which the recovery is implied in the pluperfect "had been sick."</body></html>
