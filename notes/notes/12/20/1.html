A warning to prepare for death was brought to Hezekiah by Isaiah. Prayer is one of the best preparations for death, because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God, to enable us to finish well. He wept sorely: some gather from hence that he was unwilling to die; it is in the nature of man to dread the separation of soul and body. There was also something peculiar in Hezekiah's case; he was now in the midst of his usefulness. Let Hezekiah's prayer, see Isa 38. interpret his tears; in that is nothing which is like his having been under that fear of death, which has bondage or torment. Hezekiah's piety made his sick-bed easy. O Lord, remember now; he does not speak as if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us; nor, as if the reward might be demanded as due; it is Christ's righteousness only that is the purchase of mercy and grace. Hezekiah does not pray, Lord, spare me; but, Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me be thine. God always hears the prayers of the broken in heart, and will give health, length of days, and temporal deliverances, as much and as long as is truly good for them. Means were to be used for Hezekiah's recovery; yet, considering to what a height the disease was come, and how suddenly it was checked, the cure was miraculous. It is our duty, when sick, to use such means as are proper to help nature, else we do not trust God, but tempt him. For the confirmation of his faith, the shadow of the sun was carried back, and the light was continued longer than usual, in a miraculous manner. This work of wonder shows the power of God in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes of prayer, and the great favour he bears to his chosen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In those days - Hezekiah seems to have died 697 B.C.; and his illness must belong to 713 or 714 B.C. (compare <a href="/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a>), a date which falls early in the reign of Sargon.

In those days was Hezekiah sick&#8212;As his reign lasted twenty-nine years (2Ki 18:2), and his kingdom was invaded in the fourteenth (2Ki 18:13), it is evident that this sudden and severe illness must have occurred in the very year of the Syrian invasion. Between the threatened attack and the actual appearance of the enemy, this incident in Hezekiah's history must have taken place. But according to the usage of the sacred historian, the story of Sennacherib is completed before entering on what was personal to the king of Judah (see also Isa 37:36-38:1).<p>Set thine house in order&#8212;Isaiah, being of the blood royal, might have access to the king's private house. But since the prophet was commissioned to make this announcement, the message must be considered as referring to matters of higher importance than the settlement of the king's domestic and private affairs. It must have related chiefly to the state of his kingdom, he having not as yet any son (compare 2Ki 20:6 with 2Ki 21:1).<p>for thou shall die, and not live&#8212;The disease was of a malignant character and would be mortal in its effects, unless the healing power of God should miraculously interpose.Hezekiah receiving a message of death, by prayer hath his life lengthened; for a sign the sun goeth backward, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/20-1.htm" title="In those days was Hezekiah sick to death.

But there are one or two marks which may help us to come to a conclusion. In verse 6 the promise is made ‘I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria’. But these words seem to relate rather to a further continued preservation than to the overthrow which drove Sennacherib away. Though the Assyrians were gone, it was not unlikely that they would return. It is to deliverance from all such future attacks that God’s promise is best referred. For the visit of the ambassadors of the king of Babylon was ‘at that time’ (verse 12), clearly when Hezekiah had recovered, and when time enough had elapsed for the news about the sickness and the recovery to have reached Babylon. But the embassy was not merely for the purposes of congratulation, but to secure Hezekiah’s alliance with Babylon against Assyria. The time would seem to the Babylonians most opportune for shaking off the Assyrian yoke, and the help of that power in attacking which the Assyrians had suffered so much loss, would appear the very best help that could be sought. Hence Berodach-baladan availed himself of the excuse of congratulating Hezekiah on his recovery to send an embassy to sound the king of Judah on the subject of an alliance. Hezekiah’s answer was given by the exhibition of his supplies and stores of armour. Connecting the events together thus, we come to the conclusion that Hezekiah’s sickness occurred soon after the Assyrian overthrow, and that thus the notes of time which fix (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm" title="Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.">2 Kings 18:13</a>) Sennacherib’s invasion in the <span class="ital">fourteenth</span> year of Hezekiah’s reign, and promise the king <span class="ital">fifteen</span> years more of life are substantially exact, and fill up together the <span class="ital">twenty-nine</span> years assigned to Hezekiah’s reign in <a href="/2_kings/18-2.htm" title="Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.

A message of this kind would not be sent from God without good cause. Either there had been a lack of thankfulness, or the king was too much elated with the glory of so miraculous a deliverance. That Hezekiah could think of his own greatness and forget to point to God as its author is seen as we read of the display he made before the Babylonian embassy, which is recorded in this chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days.</span> This is a very vague note of time, and cannot be regarded as determining the position of the events here related with respect to the preceding narrative. Ver. 6, however, shows that a time anterior to Sennacherib's discomfiture is intended; and the same verse also fixes the date to Hezekiah's fourteenth year, which was  <span class="date">B.C. 713</span>. If the date in <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a> be regarded as genuine, we must consider that the illness happened in the year of Sennacherib's first expedition against Palestine; but if we regard that date as interpolated, and accept the Assyrian inscriptions as our chronological authorities, we must place the events of the present chapter twelve years earlier than that expedition, in the reign of Sargon over Assyria, and in the first reign of Merodach-Baladan over Babylon. It belongs, at any rate, to the middle part of Hezekiah's reign, while his treasures were intact (vers. 13-17), and had not been carried off to Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">Was Hezekiah sick unto death</span>; stricken, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by a malady which, in the ordinary course of nature, would have been fatal. <span class="cmt_word">And the Prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him.</span> The designation of Isaiah as "the prophet," and" the son of Amoz," as if previously unknown to the reader, indicates the original independency of the narrative, which the writer of Kings probably obtained from a separate source. <span class="cmt_word">And said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</span> The statement was a warning, not a prophecy. It is parallel to that of Jonah to the Ninevites, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The sign is followed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-30.htm">2 Kings 19:30</a>, <a href="/2_kings/19-31.htm">2 Kings 19:31</a> by the distinct promise of the deliverance of Judah and Jerusalem, for which Isaiah uses the sign itself as a type. "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again strike roots downwards and bear fruit upwards; for from Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and that which is escaped from Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah will do this." &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1505;&#1507;, to add roots, i.e., to strike fresh roots. The meaning is, that Judah will not succumb to this judgment. The remnant of the nation that has escaped from destruction by the Assyrians will once more grow and flourish vigorously; for from Jerusalem will a rescued remnant go forth. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; denotes those who have escaped destruction by the judgment (cf. <a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>, etc.). The deliverance was attached to Jerusalem or to Mount Zion, not so much because the power of the Assyrians was to be destroyed before the gates of Jerusalem, as because of the greater importance which Jerusalem and Mount Zion, as the centre of the kingdom of God, the seat of the God-King, possessed in relation to the covenant-nation, so that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, it was thence that the Messianic salvation was also to proceed. This deliverance is traced to the zeal of the Lord on behalf of His people and against His foes (see at <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), like the coming of the Messiah in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> to establish an everlasting kingdom of peace and righteousness. The deliverance of Judah out of the power of Asshur was a prelude and type of the deliverance of the people of God by the Messiah out of the power of all that was ungodly. The &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; of Isaiah is omitted after &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, just as in <a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; though here it is supplied by the Masora as Keri. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a> Isaiah concludes by announcing that Sennacherib will not come to Jerusalem, nor even shoot at the city and besiege it, but will return disappointed, because the Lord will defend and save the city for the sake of His promise. The result of the whole prophecy is introduced with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;: therefore, because this is how the matter stands, viz., as explained in what precedes. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, with regard to the king, as in <a href="/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20</a>. &#1502;&#1490;&#1503; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, "he will not attack it with a shield," i.e., will not advance with shields to make an attack upon it. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; with a double accusative, as in <a href="/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>. It only occurs here in a hostile sense: to come against, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>, i.e., to advance against a city, to storm it. The four clauses of the verse stand in a graduated relation to one another: not to take, not even to shoot at and attack, yea, not even to besiege the city, will he come. In <a href="/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> we have <a href="/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a> taken up again, and <a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a> is repeated in <a href="/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> for the purpose of strengthening the promise. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; we have in Isaiah &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;: "by which he has come." The perfect is actually more exact, and the imperfect may be explained from the fact that Sennacherib was at that very time advancing against Jerusalem. In <a href="/2_kings/19-34.htm">2 Kings 19:34</a> we have &#1488;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; instead of the &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; of Isaiah: &#1506;&#1500; is more correct than &#1488;&#1500;. "For my sake," as Hezekiah had prayed in v. 19; and "for my servant David's sake," because Jehovah, as the unchangeably true One, must fulfil the promise which He gave to David (sees at <a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm">1 Kings 11:13</a>). </body></html>
