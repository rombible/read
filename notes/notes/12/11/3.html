Joash was with his aunt “in the house of the Lord”—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in one of the chambers allotted to the priests, perhaps even in the high priest’s residence, which may have been within the sacred precincts. Thenius assumes that the statement of Chronicles, that Jehosheba was wife of the high priest, has no other ground than a “traditional interpretation” of these words; and asserts that Jehosheba was herself obliged to share the asylum of the infant prince in order to escape the vengeance of Athaliah. But it is certain that the chronicler had better authority than mere tradition for his important additions to the history of the kings.

Then the king was brought forward. A child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, what was better, a good God to go to With such joy and satisfaction must the kingdom of Christ be welcomed into our hearts, when his throne is set up there, and Satan the usurper is cast out.

We learn from Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>) that Jehosheba was married to Jehoiada, the high priest, and would thus have ready access to the temple. We must suppose that, after a few days' concealment in the "chamber of mattresses," Jehosheba found an opportunity of transferring him, with his nurse, to a chamber in the temple, where he was thenceforward nourished and brought up. There were various chambers in the temple used for secular purposes, as we learn from <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-8</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5-9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Six years</span> (comp. ver. 21 and <a href="/2_chronicles/24-1.htm">2 Chronicles 24:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Athaliah did reign over the land.</span> It is difficult to realize all that this implies. It cannot mean less than that for six years Baalism was triumphant in Judah  - the temple was allowed to fall into decay (<a href="/2_kings/12-5.htm">2 Kings 12:5</a>) - a temple to Baal was erected in Jerusalem itself, to supersede the temple of Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>), and a high priest appointed to be a rival to the successor of Aaron. Whether persecution was indulged in, as under Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>), is uncertain; but the servants of Jehovah were at any rate under a cloud, slighted, contemned, held as of small account. Perhaps we may conclude, from the position occupied by Jehoiada, and from the powers which he was able to exercise when he determined on revolt (ver. 4; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1, 2</a>), that Athaliah, during her six years' reign, was to some extent held in check by a Jehovistic party, which she knew to exist, and which she did not dare openly to defy. Thus she left Jehoiada (apparently) in possession of the temple, of its treasures and its armory (ver. 10); she allowed the temple service to continue (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>); she permitted the priests and the Levites to serve in their regular "courses" (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a>); she let the fortress of the eastern city - for the temple was always a fortress  - remain in her enemies' hands. Still, the time was evidently one "of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy" the oppressed worshippers of Jehovah were greatly discontented; and the nation generally was ripe for a counter-revolution, so soon as the signal was given by an authority whom they could trust. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Therefore (this link of connection follows from the actual fact, though it is not distinctly mentioned in the text) Hazael had now to inflict chastisement upon faithless Israel. In Jehu's days Jehovah began "to cut off in Israel," i.e., to rend away certain portions from the kingdom. "Hazael smote them (the Israelites) on the whole of the border of Israel," i.e., of the kingdom, "from Jordan to the sun-rising (i.e., on the eastern side of the Jordan), the whole of the land of Gilead (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1514; is dependent upon &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; which must be supplied from &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;), namely, the territory of the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and Half-Manasseh, from Aroer on the brook Arnon (now Araayr, a ruin on the northern border of the Mojeb (Arnon) valley; see at <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>), the southern border of the Israelitish land to the east of the Jordan (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>), both Gilead and Bashan," the two countries into which Gilead in the broader sense was divided (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8-17</a>). - These conquests took place during the twenty-eight years' reign of Jehu, since Hazael began to reign before Jehu, viz., while Joram was king, and had already fought successfully against the Israelites at Ramoth in Joram's reign (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm">2 Kings 8:28-29</a>), but not in the later part of Jehu's reign, as Thenius supposes. </body></html>
