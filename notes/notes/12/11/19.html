They immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet.

The covenant between the king and the people was the consequence of this, and by it the king bound himself to rule according to the divine law, while the people engaged to submit, to give him allegiance as the Lord's anointed. The immediate fruit of this renewal of the covenant was the destruction of the temple and the slaughter of the priests of Baal (see 2Ki 10:27); the restoration of the pure worship of God in all its ancient integrity; and the establishment of the young king on the hereditary throne of Judah [2Ki 11:19].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the way of the gate of the guard, </span> i.e. by the gate of the royal palace, where the king’s guard stood. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard,....
