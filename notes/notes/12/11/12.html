It is difficult to see what objection can fairly be taken to this explanatory addition, unless we are to suppose that, although the high priest was present, the soldiers of the guard poured the sacred oil on the king’s head. Yet Thenius adduces it as an instance of the “petty spirit of the chronist,” accusing him of inserting the words “for fear anybody should think of an anointing by unconsecrated hands.” Surely such criticism as this is itself both “petty” and “wilful.” The words probably stood in the chronicler’s principal source.<p><span class= "bld">God save the king.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">Vivat rex</span>.

Having revealed to them the secret of the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and time of carrying their plot into execution (see on [336]2Ch 22:10-23:21). The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and stronger claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been divinely appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young prince on whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an inherent right to it, of which a usurper could not deprive him. Moreover, Jehoiada was most probably the high priest, whose official duty it was to watch over the due execution of God's laws, and who in his present movement, was encouraged and aided by the countenance and support of the chief authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the country. In addition to all these considerations, he seems to have been directed by an impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and exhortations of the prophets of the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The testimony, </span> i.e. the book of the law, which he put into the king’s hand, to mind him of his duty at his entrance upon his kingdom, which was to read and write out that holy book, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm" title="And it shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:">Deu 17:18</a></span>, and to govern himself and his kingdom by it; the law of God being frequently and most properly called a <span class="ital">testimony</span>, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm" title="For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:">Psalm 78:5</a> 132:12 <a href="/isaiah/8-16.htm" title="Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.">Isaiah 8:16</a>,20</span>; see also <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm" title="You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.">Deu 6:17</a>,20 <a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm" title="And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-11.htm">2 Chronicles 23:11</a>, it is said; "Jehoiada and his sons anointed him", and said those words; among whom must be Zechariah, whom this king afterwards slew, which was an instance of great ingratitude, <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he brought forth <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and <i>gave him</i> <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.</span><p>(l) That is, Joash, who had been kept secret six years.<p>(m) Meaning, the law of God, which is his chief charge, and by which only his throne is established.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">And he brought forth the king’s son</span>] i.e. Jehoiada did so, who had charge of him. The name ‘king’s son’ is perhaps given to him here rather than his personal name, to mark that the struggle was for the true successor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> gave him <span class="ital">the Testimony</span>] The word so rendered occurs first in <a href="/exodus/16-34.htm" title="As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.">Exodus 16:34</a>, where it is directed that the pot of manna is to be laid up before the <span class="ital">Testimony</span>. That by this is meant some portion of the Law which was given to Moses is made clear in a later passage. In <a href="/exodus/25-16.htm" title="And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-21.htm" title="And you shall put the mercy seat above on the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.">Exodus 25:21</a> it is described as ‘the <span class="ital">Testimony</span> which I shall give thee’. We need not suppose that in these passages the whole law of Moses is intended, but the name given to the first portion of the Law would no doubt be continued in after times for all that was considered to be the divine revelation. Hence we must here understand the Law, as the people then possessed it. Express direction is given in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/17-18.htm" title="And it shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:...">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a>, that when a king shall be chosen he shall have a copy of the Law, which he shall study ‘that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them’. So the delivery of the Law would naturally form a most solemn portion of the coronation ceremony.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and anointed him</span>] This was not done as far as we know with all kings, but the present was a special occasion, and no part of the ordinance would be omitted which could help to mark in a religious manner the restoration of the true scion of David’s house.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and they clapt their hands</span>] A natural expression of approval and applause, though not frequently spoken of in the O. Test. It is found in the <a href="/psalms/47-1.htm" title="O clap your hands, all you people; shout to God with the voice of triumph.">Psalm 47:1</a> of exultation before God, and the figure is used <a href="/psalms/98-8.htm" title="Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together">Psalm 98:8</a> ‘Let the floods clap their hands’. But it is quite as frequently used where rejoicing over a fallen enemy is the cause (cf. <a href="/job/27-23.htm" title="Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.">Job 27:23</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm" title="All that pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?">Lamentations 2:15</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-19.htm" title="There is no healing of your bruise; your wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of you shall clap the hands over you: for on whom has not your wickedness passed continually?">Nahum 3:19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God save the king</span>] Literally ‘Let the king live’. So they cried when Saul was made king, <a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm" title="And Samuel said to all the people, See you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.">1 Samuel 10:24</a>, and at the feast of Adonijah when he sought to be king, <a href="/1_kings/1-25.htm" title="For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.">1 Kings 1:25</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiada - <span class="cmt_word">brought forth the king's son</span> - produced him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the chamber or chambers where he had been concealed hitherto.

The crown was probably a band of gold, either plain or set with jewels (<a href="/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a>), fastened behind with a riband. It receives here the same name that is given to the high priest's diadem in <a href="/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a> and Exodus 39:30. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him the testimony.</span> The words "gave him" are not in the original, and are superfluous. What is meant plainly is that the high priest laid on the young king's head a copy of the Law, or of some essential portion of it, perhaps the Decalogue, which is often called "the testimony" (<a href="/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16, 21</a>, etc.). The object apparently was to show that the king was to rule by law, not arbitrarily - that he was to be, as Dean Stanley says, "not above, but beneath, the law of his country" ('Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 397). The ceremony seems to have been a new one, and is indicative of the gradual curtailment of the regal power under the later monarchy. <span class="cmt_word">And they made him king, and anointed him.</span> A change is made from the singular to the plural, because, as we learn from <a href="/2_chronicles/23-11.htm">2 Chronicles 23:11</a>, "Jehoiada <span class="accented">and his</span> sons anointed him." We have had no mention of the anointing of a new monarch in Judah since the time of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>).

"The third part of you that come on the Sabbath (i.e., mount guard) shall keep the guard of the king's house (&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497; is a corruption of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;), and the third part shall be at the gate Sur, and the third part at the gate behind the runners, and (ye) shall keep guard over the house for defence; and the two parts of you, (namely) all who depart on the Sabbath, shall keep the guard of the house of Jehovah for the king; and ye shall surround the king round about, every one with his weapons in his hand; and whoever presses into the ranks shall be slain, and shall be with the king when he goes out and in," i.e., in all his steps. The words &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;, "those coming and those going out on the Sabbath," denote the divisions of the watch, those who performed duty on the Sabbath and those who were relieved on the Sabbath; not the military guard at the palace however, but the temple-guard, which consisted of Levites. For David had divided the priests and Levites into classes, every one of which had to perform service for a week and was relieved on the Sabbath: compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23-26</a> with Josephus (Ant. vii. 14, 7), who expressly says that every one of the twenty-four classes of priests had to attend to the worship of God "for eight days, from Sabbath to Sabbath," also with <a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5</a>. On the other hand, we do not know that there was any similar division and obligation to serve in connection with the royal body-guard or with the army. The current opinion, that by those who come on the Sabbath and those who go out on the Sabbath we are to understand the king's halberdiers or the guard of the palace, is therefore proved to be unfounded and untenable. And if there could be any doubt on the matter, it would be removed by <a href="/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a> and <a href="/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a>, two parts of those who went away (were relieved) on the Sabbath were to undertake the guarding of the house of Jehovah about the king, i.e., to keep guard over that room in the temple where the king then was. Could Jehoiada have used the royal body-guard, that was being relieved from guarding the palace, for such a purpose as this? Who can imagine that this is a credible thing? According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm">2 Kings 11:10</a>, Jehoiada gave to the captains over a hundred the weapons of king David, which were in the house of Jehovah. Did the palace-guard then return without weapons? In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a>, "those coming on the Sabbath" are correctly described as the priests and Levites coming on the Sabbath, i.e., the priests and Levites who entered upon their week's duty at the temple on the Sabbath. According to this explanation of the words, which is the only one that can be grammatically sustained, the facts were as follows: "When Jehoiada had initiated the captains of the royal halberdiers, and with their help the heads of families of the people generally, into his plan of raising the youthful Joash to the throne and dethroning Athaliah, he determined to carry out the affair chiefly with the help of the priests and Levites who entered upon their duty in the temple on the Sabbath, and of those who left or were relived at the same time, and entrusted the command over these men to the captains of the royal halberdiers, that they might occupy the approaches to the temple with the priests and Levites under their command, so as to prevent the approach of any military from the king's palace and protect the youthful king. These captains had come to the temple without weapons, to avoid attracting attention. Jehoiada therefore gave them the weapons of king David that were kept in the temple.<p>With regard to the distribution of the different posts, the fact that two-thirds are spoken of first of all in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a>, and then two parts in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a>, occasions no difficulty. For the two-thirds mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm">2 Kings 11:5</a>, <a href="/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a> were those who came on the Sabbath, whereas the "two divisions" (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;) referred to in <a href="/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a> were all who went away on the Sabbath. Consequently the priests and Levites, who came on the Sabbath and entered upon the week's service, were divided into three sections; and those who should have been relieved, but were detained, into two. Probably the number of those who came this time to perform service at the temple was much larger than usual, as the priests were initiated into Jehoiada's secret; so that it was possible to make three divisions of those who arrived, whereas those who were about to depart could only be formed into two. The three divisions of those who were entering upon duty are also distinctly mentioned in the Chronicles; whereas, instead of the two divisions of those who were relieved, "all the people" are spoken of. The description of the different posts which were assigned to these several companies causes some difficulty. In general, so much is clearly indicated in <a href="/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-8.htm">2 Kings 11:8</a>, that the two divisions of those who were relieved on the Sabbath were to keep guard over the young king in the house of Jehovah, and therefore to remain in the inner spaces of the temple-court for his protection; whereas the three divisions of those who were entering upon duty were charged with the occupation of the external approaches to the temple. One-third was to "keep watch over the king's house," i.e., to observe whatever had to be observed in relation to the king's palace; not to occupy the king's palace, or to keep guard in the citadel at the palace gate (Thenius), but to keep watch towards the royal palace, i.e., to post themselves so that no one could force a way into the temple, with which the indefinite &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; in the Chronicles harmonizes, if we only translate it "against (at) the king's house." The idea that the palace was guarded is precluded not only by <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-13.htm">2 Kings 11:13</a>, according to which Athaliah came out of the palace to the people to the house of Jehovah, which she would not have been able to do if the palace had been guarded, but also by the circumstance that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>, the chief men were in the temple with the whole of the (assembled) people, and did not go out of the house of Jehovah into the king's house till after the anointing of Joash and the death of Athaliah. The other third was to station itself at the gate Sur (&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;), or, according to the Chronicles, Yesod (&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;), foundation-gate. There is no doubt as to the identity of the gate Sur and the gate Yesod; only we cannot decide whether one of these names has simply sprung from a copyist's error, or whether the gate had two different names. The name &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, foundation-gate, suggests a gate in the outer court of the temple, at the hollow of either the Tyropoeon or the Kedron; for the context precludes our thinking of a palace gate. The third division was to be posted "at the gate behind the runners;" or, as it is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>, "at the gate of the runners." It is very evident from <a href="/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a> that this gate led from the temple-court to the royal palace upon Zion, and was therefore on the western side of the court of the temple. This also follows from <a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a> of the Chronicles, according to which this division was to act as "doorkeepers of the thresholds" (&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;), i.e., to keep guard at the gate of the thresholds. For we may safely infer, from a comparison with <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>, that &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; were the thresholds of the ascent to the temple. The last clause, "and shall keep guard over the house for defence," refers to all three divisions, and serves to define with greater precision the object for which they were stationed there. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1495; is not a proper name (lxx, Luther, and others), but an appellative in the sense of defence or resistance, from &#1504;&#1505;&#1495;, depellere. The meaning is, that they were to guard the house, to keep off the people, and not to let any of the party of Athaliah force a way into the temple. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a>, &#1492;&#1513; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is an explanatory apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; ot  &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "and the two parts in (of) you," namely, all who go out on the Sabbath, i.e., are relieved from duty. Their task, to observe the watch of the house of Jehovah with regard to the king, is more precisely defined in <a href="/2_kings/11-8.htm">2 Kings 11:8</a> as signifying, that they were to surround the king with weapons in their hands, and slay every one who attempted to force a way into their ranks. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;&#1493;, i.e., in all his undertakings, or in all his steps; &#1493;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; being applied to the actions and pursuits of a man, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>, etc. (see the Comm. on <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>). Thenius has explained this incorrectly: "in his going out of the temple and entering into the palace."</body></html>
