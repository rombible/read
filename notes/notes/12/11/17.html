They immediately abolished idolatry; and, pursuant to the covenant with one another, they expressed mutual readiness to help each other. The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was quiet.

The covenant between the king and the people was the consequence of this, and by it the king bound himself to rule according to the divine law, while the people engaged to submit, to give him allegiance as the Lord's anointed. The immediate fruit of this renewal of the covenant was the destruction of the temple and the slaughter of the priests of Baal (see 2Ki 10:27); the restoration of the pure worship of God in all its ancient integrity; and the establishment of the young king on the hereditary throne of Judah [2Ki 11:19].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Between the Lord and the king and the people; </span> a sacred covenant, whereby he solemnly engaged both the king and people, as it here follows, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that they should be the Lord’s people, </span> i.e. that they should renounce and root out all idolatry, and set up and maintain God’s true worship.

The high priest gave the captains "the spears and shields (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;: see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>) which (belonged) to king David, that were in the house of Jehovah," i.e., the weapons which David had presented to the sanctuary as dedicatory offerings. Instead of &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; we ought probably to read &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514; (cf. <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>), after the &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; of the Chronicles, since the collective force of &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; is very improbable in prose, and a &#1514; might easily drop out through a copyist's error. Jehoiada gave the captains weapons from the temple, because, as has been already observed, they had come unarmed, and not, as Thenius imagines, to provide them with old and sacred weapons instead of their ordinary ones. In <a href="/2_kings/11-11.htm">2 Kings 11:11</a> the position of all the divisions is given in a comprehensive manner, for the purpose of appending the further course of the affair, namely, the coronation of the king. "Thus the halberdiers stood, every one with his weapons in his hand, from the right wing of the house to the left wing, towards the altar (of burnt-offering) and the (temple-) house, round about the king," i.e., to cover the king on all sides. For it is evident that we are not to understand &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; as signifying the encircling of the king, from the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>, according to which Jehoiada did not bring out the king's son till after the men had taken up their positions. The use of &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, to signify the captains with the armed priests and Levites put under their command for this purpose, is an uncommon one, but it may be explained from the fact that &#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; had retained the general meaning of royal halberdiers; and the priests and Levites under the command of the captains of the royal body-guard by this very act discharged the duty of the royal body-guard itself. The chronicler has used the indefinite expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;-haa`aam, the whole of the people assembled in the temple-court.</body></html>
