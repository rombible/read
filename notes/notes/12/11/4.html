The curious fact that his rank is not specified hero upon the <span class= "ital">first</span> mention of his name, suggests the inference that in the original authority of this narrative he had been mentioned as high priest, and husband of Jehosheba, at the outset of the story, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/22-11.htm" title="But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber.

Thenius argues against the idea that so patriotic and pious a king as David could have employed foreign and heathen soldiers as his body-guard. But did not David himself serve as a mercenary with Achish, king of Gath, and commit his parents to the care of the king of Moab? And would not the mercenaries who enlisted in the guard of the Israelite sovereigns adopt the religion of their new country? (Comp. the case of Uriah <span class= "ital">the Hittite</span>.)

His account of the whole transaction, while generally coinciding with that given here, presents certain striking differences, of which the most salient is the prominence assigned to the priests and Levites in the matter. These deviations are explicable on the assumption that the chronicler drew his information from a large historical compilation somewhat later than the Books of Kings, and containing much more than they contain, though mainly based upon the same annalistic sources. The compilors of the two canonical histories were determined in their choice of materials and manner of treatment by their individual aims and points of view, which differed considerably. (See the Introductions to Kings and Chronicles.) At the same time, it must not be forgotten that the account before us is the older and more original, and, therefore, the more valuable regarded as mere history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_kings/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm" title="And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.">2 Kings 11:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">With the captains and the guard — </span>The chief commanders of the soldiery, and those that had been the former king’s guard; for it is not likely that he would dare to call the guard of the present queen: and it is probable that the former could not well brook the dominion of a woman, and that woman a foreigner. <span class="ital">And brought them into the house of the Lord — </span>Into the courts of that house; for into the house itself, strictly speaking, none but the priests or Levites might enter. <span class="ital">And showed them the king’s son — </span>He discovered to them the true heir of the crown, and they entered into a covenant to restore him, which they confirmed with an oath. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-12 Athaliah destroyed all she knew to be akin to the crown.

Having revealed to them the secret of the young king's preservation and entered into a covenant with them for the overthrow of the tyrant, he then arranged with them the plan and time of carrying their plot into execution (see on [336]2Ch 22:10-23:21). The conduct of Jehoiada, who acted the leading and chief part in this conspiracy, admits of an easy and full justification; for, while Athaliah was a usurper, and belonged to a race destined by divine denunciation to destruction, even his own wife had a better and stronger claim to the throne; the sovereignty of Judah had been divinely appropriated to the family of David, and therefore the young prince on whom it was proposed to confer the crown, possessed an inherent right to it, of which a usurper could not deprive him. Moreover, Jehoiada was most probably the high priest, whose official duty it was to watch over the due execution of God's laws, and who in his present movement, was encouraged and aided by the countenance and support of the chief authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, in the country. In addition to all these considerations, he seems to have been directed by an impulse of the Divine Spirit, through the counsels and exhortations of the prophets of the time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If this action of Jehoiada’s seem strange and irregular, this was no ordinary case, but there were divers peculiar things in it, as, that Athaliah was a mere usurper, having no pretence of right to the crown, and one of that wicked house which God had particularly, and by name, devoted to destruction: that Jehoiada’s wife was nearer allied, and had more right to the crown, than Athaliah: that thee crown of Judah was by Divine appointment appropriated to the sons of David; and therefore the right of the crown was inherently in him whom Jehoiada set up, which right her usurpation could not exclude: that Jehoiada was not a mere private person, but the husband of the king’s aunt; and probably the high priest, to whom it belonged in great part to see the laws of God executed: that Jehoiada did not act alone in the business, but had the consent and concurrence of the chief rulers, both civil and ecclesiastical: and besides all this, that it is conceived that he had a special motion of God’s Spirit, or the direction and encouragement of the prophets of that time.

For other allusions thereto cf. <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm" title="Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:">Exodus 18:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-25.htm" title="And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.">Exodus 18:25</a>, and when the more military character had been introduced <a href="/1_samuel/8-12.htm" title="And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.">1 Samuel 8:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-7.htm" title="Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;">1 Samuel 22:7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-1.htm" title="And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.">2 Samuel 18:1</a>. In the parallel passage A.V. has ‘captains’ <a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm" title="And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>. <span class="ital">Fet</span> is the constant preterite of ‘fetch’ in the English of A.V. For similar instances of dropping the ‘ch’ of the present, compare the preterites of <span class="ital">catch</span> and <span class="ital">search</span>, which, as far as sound is concerned, might be written <span class="ital">caut</span> and <span class="ital">saut</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the captains and the guard</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">of the Carites and of the guard</span>. Here both nouns are in a construction which shews that the captains over hundreds belonged to both the classes of men here mentioned. Hence, as the word rendered ‘guard’ is literally ‘runners’ and applies to the royal body-guard, so the ‘Carites’ are thought to be a similar class. The word only occurs in this chapter verses 4 and 19 and in <a href="/2_samuel/20-23.htm" title="Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:">2 Samuel 20:23</a>, where the <span class="ital">Keri</span> (marginal reading) substitutes ‘Cherethites’. As in that passage the Carites, or Cherethites, and Pelethites formed David’s guard, so at this time there appear to have been similar body-guards attached to the palace in Jerusalem. The word may be derived from a verb which marks them as ‘executioners’, which office was performed, as we see from many instances, by those in immediate attendance on the king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These officers were strictly military, and it is worth notice that the compiler in Chronicles, who is usually thought to lay most stress on, and give most importance to, what was done by the priests and Levites, yet at this point is very careful to notice the names of these five soldiers ‘Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri’, while he gives no such prominence to the names of any of the priests or Levites, except the chief actor Jehoiada.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>into <span class="ital">the house of the Lord</span>] We can see from such passages as <a href="/jeremiah/35-2.htm" title="Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.">Jeremiah 35:2</a>, where the prophet is bidden to bring the Rechabites ‘into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers’ that the rooms by which the temple was surrounded were used for meetings such as the one here described.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and made a covenant with them</span>] In 2 Chronicles we are told how these officers were first employed: ‘They went about in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah and the chief of the fathers of Israel (R.V. <span class="bld">heads of fathers</span>’ <span class="ital">houses</span> <span class="bld">in Israel</span>), and they came to Jerusalem. Jehoiada sent them to the persons with whom, by reason of his office, he would have the greatest influence, but the operations were ultimately to be under the command of the captains of the guard.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-16.</span> - <span class="accented">Conspiracy of Jehoiada</span>. After waiting, impatiently we may be sure, for six long years, and seeing the young prince grow from an infant to a boy of seven years of age, Jehoiada deemed that the time was come to venture on an effort. It was necessary for him to make his arrangements beforehand with great care. His first step was to sound the captains of the royal guard. To these men, five in number (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), he sent secretly, and in-wired them to confer with him in the temple on important business. Finding them well disposed to adopt his views, he revealed to them the fact that Joash had escaped the massacre of Ahaziah's sons, and was still living, even allowing them to see him. The result of the interview was that they put themselves at Jehoiada's disposal, and agreed to take their orders from him (ver. 4). Jehoiada then proceeded to his second step. Either distrusting the body-guard which the captains commanded, or regarding it as insufficient in numbers, he gave them orders to visit the various cities of Judea, and collect from them a strong force of Levites and other trusty persons, and bring them to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), where he would give them their orders. This was done successfully, and, as it would seem, without in any way rousing the suspicions of Athaliah. A day was fixed for proclaiming Joash king; the guard and the Levites were skillfully disposed about the temple and the palace; the king was brought up, crowned, anointed, and saluted as monarch, with noisy acclamations (ver. 12). The noise was heard in the palace, and Athaliah went forth, with a few attendants, to inquire the reason of it. Following the sound, she came to the temple, and entered it, when she saw what was going on, and cried out, "Treason! Treason!" By Jehoiada's order the guards seized her, conducted her out of the temple, and slew her (vers. 13-16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh year</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and in the seventh year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the course of it  - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds,</span> <span class="cmt_word">with the captains and the guard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the captains over hundreds</span> (or, centurions) <span class="accented">of the Carites and the guard</span> (see the Revised Version). The "Carites," here first named, are generally regarded as identical with the Cherethites of earlier times (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>). They were undoubtedly a particular portion of the royal guard, and may, perhaps, as many suppose, have been "Caftan" mercenaries, though we have no other evidence that the Carians had adopted the mercenary life so early as the time of Athaliah. Still, as their devotion to it had passed into a proverb when Archilochus wrote (B.C. 700-660), it is quite possible that they had begun the practice a century or two earlier. When Jehoiada is said to have "sent and fetched" the centurions, we must understand that he secretly invited them, and that they consented to come. He could not possibly have any authority over them, so as to require their attendance. The names of the five centurions, together with their fathers' names, were put on record by the writer of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>), whose account of the revolution is in many respects fuller than that in Kings. <span class="cmt_word">And brought them to him into the house of the Lord</span> - as the safest place for an interview which had to be kept secret from the queen - <span class="cmt_word">and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the Lord.</span> We can easily understand that the soldiers, who had been willing to serve Athaliah under the notion that the house of David was extinct, might waver in their allegiance so soon as they heard that a scion of the old royal stock survived, and could be produced at a moment's notice. Their traditions would attach them to David and his seed, not to the house of Ahab. <span class="cmt_word">And showed them the king's son.</span> Having bound the centurions by a solemn covenant to the cause of the young king, Jehoiada introduced them into his presence. He had, no doubt, previously sworn them to secrecy. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Conclusion of the history of Jehu's reign. The length of his reign is not given till the end in this instance (<a href="/2_kings/10-36.htm">2 Kings 10:36</a>), contrary to the usual custom in our books, because his ascent of the throne is not expressly mentioned in what precedes; but the general character of his reign is given in immediate connection with the account of his anointing and of the extermination of Ahab's dynasty. </body></html>
