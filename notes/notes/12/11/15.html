The changes bring the version into close agreement with 2 Chron.

That the meaning is ‘within’ and not ‘without’ the ranks is manifest from <a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm" title="Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:">Leviticus 16:15</a> where the same prepositional form is found and cannot be otherwise translated than ‘within’. The object of Jehoiada’s order is plain. He would keep Athaliah surrounded by his own guards, but get her removed beyond the precincts of the temple. This harmonizes with the order recorded at the end of this verse, that she should not be slain in the house of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and him that followeth her kill</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">slay</span>] <span class="ital">with the sword</span>] The verb is the same as in the next clause. The persons who might perhaps be expected lo follow her, when she was led away guarded from the temple, would be those of her own attendants, who had not been allowed to come between the lines of the guard, yet now might think it their duty to try and rescue their mistress.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains</span> - literally, <span class="accented">princes</span> - <span class="cmt_word">of the hundreds, the officers of the host</span> - the commanders, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the small "army" assembled in the temple court - <span class="cmt_word">and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges</span>; rather, <span class="accented">have her forth</span>, or conduct her out <span class="accented">between your ranks</span>. The object was probably to preserve her from suffering violence at the hands of any of the people within the temple precincts, which Jehoiada desired to preserve free from pollution. <span class="cmt_word">And him that followeth her kill with the sword</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if any come after her out of the temple, to attempt a rescue, slay them with the sword. The order, given aloud, was sufficient to deter persons from making the attempt. <span class="cmt_word">For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord.</span> Jehoiada had previously given an order that her execution should take place outside the temple. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The execution of these plans. The high priest gave the captains "the spears and shields (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;: see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>) which (belonged) to king David, that were in the house of Jehovah," i.e., the weapons which David had presented to the sanctuary as dedicatory offerings. Instead of &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; we ought probably to read &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514; (cf. <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>), after the &#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; of the Chronicles, since the collective force of &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; is very improbable in prose, and a &#1514; might easily drop out through a copyist's error. Jehoiada gave the captains weapons from the temple, because, as has been already observed, they had come unarmed, and not, as Thenius imagines, to provide them with old and sacred weapons instead of their ordinary ones. In <a href="/2_kings/11-11.htm">2 Kings 11:11</a> the position of all the divisions is given in a comprehensive manner, for the purpose of appending the further course of the affair, namely, the coronation of the king. "Thus the halberdiers stood, every one with his weapons in his hand, from the right wing of the house to the left wing, towards the altar (of burnt-offering) and the (temple-) house, round about the king," i.e., to cover the king on all sides. For it is evident that we are not to understand &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; as signifying the encircling of the king, from the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>, according to which Jehoiada did not bring out the king's son till after the men had taken up their positions. The use of &#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, to signify the captains with the armed priests and Levites put under their command for this purpose, is an uncommon one, but it may be explained from the fact that &#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; had retained the general meaning of royal halberdiers; and the priests and Levites under the command of the captains of the royal body-guard by this very act discharged the duty of the royal body-guard itself. The chronicler has used the indefinite expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;-haa`aam, the whole of the people assembled in the temple-court.</body></html>
