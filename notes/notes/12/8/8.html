It is not long since he sent a great force to seize and treat Elisha as an enemy; yet now he courts and inquires of him as a prophet: thus affliction brings those to God, who, in their prosperity, made light of him: it opens men’s eyes, and rectifies their mistakes: and among other instances of the change it produces in their minds, this is one, and not the least considerable, that it often gives them other thoughts of God’s ministers, and teaches them to value those whom they before hated and despised. Affliction, however, has not this good effect upon all: it only blinds and hardens some. We lately saw even a king of Israel sending, in his sickness, to inquire of the god of Ekron, as if there had been no God in Israel. How does the conduct of this heathen, in similar circumstances, reprove and condemn the idolatrous and incorrigible Israelite! Thus does God sometimes fetch that honour to himself from strangers, which is denied him, and alienated from him, by his own professing people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:7-15 Among other changes of men's minds by affliction, it often gives other thoughts of God's ministers, and teaches to value the counsels and prayers of those whom they have hated and despised. It was not in Hazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God revealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the more foresight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possible for a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciled to it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine how strong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever they arrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how much worse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shall certainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security. Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazael murdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been without any design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutor to Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hazael was no doubt a high officer of the court. The names of Hazael and Benhadad occur in the Assyrian inscription on the Black Obelisk now in the British Museum. Both are mentioned as kings of Damascus, who contended with a certain Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, and suffered defeat at his hands. In one of the battles between this king and Benhadad, "Allah of Jezreel" is mentioned among the allies of the latter. This same Shalmaneser took tribute from Jehu. This is the point at which the Assyrian records first come in direct contact with those of the Jews. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 8:7-15.

According to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:4. &sect; 6), he was "the most faithful of the king's domestics" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). We cannot presume from ver. 12 that he had as yet distinguished himself as a warrior. <span class="cmt_word">Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God.</span> It was usual, both among the heathen and among the Israelites, for those who consulted a prophet to bring him a present (see <a href="/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>). Hence, mainly, the great wealth of the Delphic and other oracles. Naaman (<a href="/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>) had brought with him a rich present when he went to consult Elisha in Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And inquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease!</span> The miracles of Elisha had had at any rate this effect - they had convinced the Syrians that Jehovah was a great and powerful God, and made them regard Elisha himself as a true prophet. Their faith in their own superstitions must have been at least partially shaken by these convictions. It was by these and similar weakenings of established errors that the world was gradually educated, and the way prepared for the introduction of Christianity. There was very early among the Syrians a flourishing Christian Church. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elisha's Influence Helps the Shunammite to the Possession of her House and Field. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1</a>, <a href="/2_kings/8-2.htm">2 Kings 8:2</a>. By the advice of Elisha, the woman whose son the prophet had restored to life (<a href="/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>) had gone with her family into the land of the Philistines during a seven years' famine, and had remained there seven years. The two verses are rendered by most commentators in the pluperfect, and that with perfect correctness, for they are circumstantial clauses, and &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; is merely a continuation of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, the two together preparing the way for, and introducing the following event. The object is not to relate a prophecy of Elisha of the seven years' famine, but what afterwards occurred, namely, how king Joram was induced by the account of Elisha's miraculous works to have the property of the Shunammite restored to her upon her application. The seven years' famine occurred in the middle of Joram's reign, and the event related here took place before the curing of Naaman the Syrian (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a>), as is evident from the fact that Gehazi talked with the king (<a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>), and therefore had not yet been punished with leprosy.

By the words, "the Lord called the famine, and it came seven years" (sc., lasting that time), the famine is described as a divine judgment for the idolatry of the nation. </body></html>
