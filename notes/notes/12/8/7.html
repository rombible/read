Rashi suggests that it was to fetch back Gehazi, who had fled to the Syrians (!), an idea based upon <a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.">1Kings 2:39</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>. Keil and others think the prophet went with the intention of anointing Hazael, in accordance with a supposed charge of Elijah’s. (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:">1Kings 19:15</a>, where Elijah himself is bidden to anoint Hazael). Ewald believes that Elisha retreated to Damascene territory, in consequence of the strained relations existing between him and Jehoram, owing to the latter’s toleration of idolatry. Obviously all this rests upon pure conjecture. It is clear from <a href="/2_kings/8-7.htm" title="And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.">2Kings 8:7</a> that Elisha’s visit was not expected in Damascus, and further, that there was peace at the time between Damascus and Samaria. We do not know how much of Elisha’s history has been omitted between <a href="/2_kings/7-20.htm" title="And so it fell out to him: for the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died.">2Kings 7:20</a> and <a href="/2_kings/8-7.htm" title="And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.">2Kings 8:7</a>; but we may fairly assume that a <span class= "ital">divine impulse</span> led the prophet to Damascus. The revelation, of which he speaks in <a href="/2_kings/8-10.htm" title="And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You may certainly recover: however, the LORD has showed me that he shall surely die.">2Kings 8:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm" title="And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?

It was not in Hazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God revealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the more foresight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possible for a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciled to it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine how strong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever they arrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how much worse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shall certainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security. Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazael murdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been without any design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutor to Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The hour had come for carrying out the command given by God to Elijah (marginal reference "e"), and by him probably passed on to his successor.

For Hazael (verse 9) has a journey to make to meet the prophet, and is sent from the royal city by the sick king with his enquiry. We need not suppose that Elisha went to fulfil the command which had been given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:">1 Kings 19:15</a>) to anoint Hazael king over Syria. For he does not anoint him, but merely says ‘The Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria’. Elisha appears to have been in no peril when he went into Syria, for the sick king’s message is of the most peaceable kind, and the presents which Hazael brought with him are an indication of the honour in which the prophet was held. This may be accounted for by the cure of Naaman, and by the release of the Syrian soldiers whom the prophet had brought into Samaria (<a href="/context/2_kings/6-22.htm" title="And he answered, You shall not smite them: would you smite those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master....">2 Kings 6:22-23</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The man of God is come hither</span>] Benhadad had experienced in many ways the power of the God of Israel, and though Rimmon was the god of Damascus, yet, in common with other idolaters, the king thinks that it may be possible for him, through the prophet, to obtain help from the Israelites’ God. Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 4. 6) represents Benhadad as having sickened from despondency after his late flight from Samaria, and because the God of Israel was hostile to him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-15.</span> <span class="accented">- Elisha's visit to Damascus</span>, <span class="accented">and its consequences</span>. It has been usual to connect this visit of Elisha's to Damascus with the commission given to Elijah many years previously, to anoint Hazael to be king over Syria (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). But it is certainly worthy of remark that neither is Elijah authorized to devolve his corn-mission on another, nor is he said to have done so, nor is there any statement in the present narrative or elsewhere that Elisha anointed Hazael. It is therefore quite possible that Elisha's journey was wholly unconnected with the command given to Elijah. It may, as Ewald imagines, have been the consequence of disorders and dangers in Samaria, growing out of the divergence of views between Jehoram and the queen-mother Jezebel, who still retained considerable influence over the government; and Elisha may have taken his journey, not so much for the sake of a visit, as of a prolonged sojourn. That he attracted the attention both of Benhadad and of his successor Hazael is not surprising. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha came to Damascus.</span> It was a bold step, whatever the circumstances that led to it. Not very long previously the Syrian king had made extraordinary efforts to capture Elisha, intending either to kin him or to keep him confined as a prisoner (<a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18-19</a>). Elisha had subsequently helped to baffle his plans of conquest, and might be thought to have caused the disgraceful retreat of the Syrian army from the walls of Samaria, which he had certainly prophesied (<a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>). But Elisha was not afraid. He was probably <span class="accented">commissioned</span> to take his journey, whether its purpose was the anointing of Hazael or no. <span class="cmt_word">And Benhadad the King of Syria was sick.</span> Ewald supposes that this "sickness" was the result of the disgrace and discredit into which he had fallen since his ignominious retreat, without assignable reason, from before the walls of Samaria; but Ben-hadad must have been of an age When the infirmities of nature press in upon a man, and when illness has to be expected. He was a contemporary of Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), who had now been dead ten or twelve years. <span class="cmt_word">And it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</span> Elisha seems to have attempted no concealment of his presence. No sooner was he arrived than his coming was reported to Benhadad. The Syrians had by this time learnt to give him the name by which he was commonly known (<a href="/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 21, 40</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2, 18</a>) in Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elisha's Influence Helps the Shunammite to the Possession of her House and Field. - <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1</a>, <a href="/2_kings/8-2.htm">2 Kings 8:2</a>. By the advice of Elisha, the woman whose son the prophet had restored to life (<a href="/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>) had gone with her family into the land of the Philistines during a seven years' famine, and had remained there seven years. The two verses are rendered by most commentators in the pluperfect, and that with perfect correctness, for they are circumstantial clauses, and &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; is merely a continuation of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, the two together preparing the way for, and introducing the following event. The object is not to relate a prophecy of Elisha of the seven years' famine, but what afterwards occurred, namely, how king Joram was induced by the account of Elisha's miraculous works to have the property of the Shunammite restored to her upon her application. The seven years' famine occurred in the middle of Joram's reign, and the event related here took place before the curing of Naaman the Syrian (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a>), as is evident from the fact that Gehazi talked with the king (<a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>), and therefore had not yet been punished with leprosy. But it cannot have originally stood between <a href="/2_kings/4-37.htm">2 Kings 4:37</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>, as Thenius supposes, because the incidents related in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38-44</a> belong to the time of this famine (cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>), and therefore precede the occurrence mentioned here. By the words, "the Lord called the famine, and it came seven years" (sc., lasting that time), the famine is described as a divine judgment for the idolatry of the nation. </body></html>
