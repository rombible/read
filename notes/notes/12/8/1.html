It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, when we foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When the famine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; that was no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there was necessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her own people, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; but there is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons may fail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we think we shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove of consequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request, and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The famine here recorded, and the conversation of the monarch with Gehazi, must have been anterior to the events related in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a> since we may be sure that a king of Israel would not have entered into familiar conversation with a confirmed leper. The writer of Kings probably col ected the miracles of Elisha from various sources, and did not always arrange them chronologically. Here the link of connection is to be found in the nature of the miracle. As Elisha on one occasion prophesied plenty, so on another he had prophesied a famine.<p>Called for a famine - A frequent expression (compare the marginal references).

It is clear from verse 3 that Elisha’s advice was given at least seven years before the event narrated in these verses. Hence the necessity for the change of tense. It is probable that the accounts of Elisha’s work and influence are not related in their chronological order. The famine here spoken of was most likely the same to which allusion is made in <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm" title="And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.">2 Kings 4:38</a>, and perhaps the conference of the king with Gehazi mentioned in verse 4 took place before the latter was smitten with leprosy. It is not however absolutely certain that Jehoram might not have an interview with Gehazi, though leprous. Bp Hall says of them: ‘I begin to think some goodness in both these. Had there not been some goodness in Jehoram, he had not taken pleasure to hear, even from a leprous mouth, the miraculous acts and praises of God’s prophet: had there not been some goodness in Gehazi, he had not, after so fearful an infliction of judgement, thus ingenuously recounted the praises of his severe master’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the woman, whose son he had restored</span>] i.e. the Shunammite whose story is told in <a href="/context/2_kings/4-8.htm" title="And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread....">2 Kings 4:8-37</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn</span>] Why such advice should be given to a woman, who from the history appears to have been in better circumstances than others, it is not easy to decide. As the husband is nowhere mentioned in this appeal to Jehoram, it may be that he, being already old when the son was restored to life, had in the meantime died. Then she may have fallen into some distress, and have been unable to dwell on the lands which her husband had cultivated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord hath called for a famine</span>] Similarly the Lord is said <span class="ital">to call for</span> the sword against a land, <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm" title="For, see, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you be utterly unpunished?

Elisha, on its approach, recommended the Shunammite, though she was a woman of substance (<a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>), to quit her home and remove to some other residence, where she mighty, escape the pressure of the calamity He left it to her to choose the place of her temporary abode. The phrase, "God hath <span class="accented">called for</span> a famine," means no more and no less than "God has determined that there shall be a famine." With God to speak the word is to bring about the event. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall also come upon the land seven years.</span> Seven years was the actual duration of the great famine, which Joseph foretold in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>), and was the ideally perfect period for a severe famine (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-13.htm">2 Chronicles 24:13</a>). Many of the best meteorologists are inclined to regard the term of "seven years" as a cyclic period in connection with weather changes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king imagined that the unexpected departure of the Syrians was only a ruse, namely, that they had left the camp and hidden themselves in the field, to entice the besieged out of the fortress, and then fall upon them and press into the city. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; according to later usage for &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 244, a). In order to make sure of the correctness or incorrectness of this conjecture, one of the king's servants (counsellors) gave this advice: "Let them take (the Vav before &#1497;&#1511;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; as in <a href="/2_kings/4-41.htm">2 Kings 4:41</a>) five of the horses left in the city, that we may send and see how the matter stands." The words, "Behold they (the five horses) are as the whole multitude of Israel that are left in it (the city); behold they are as the whole multitude of Israel that are gone," have this meaning: The five horsemen (for horses stand for horsemen, as it is self-evident that it was men on horseback and not the horses themselves that were to be sent out as spies) can but share the fate of the rest of the people of Samaria, whether they return unhurt to meet death by starvation with the people that still remain, or fall into the hands of the enemy and are put to death, in which case they will only suffer the lot of those who have already perished. Five horses is an approximative small number, and is therefore not at variance with the following statement, that two pair of horses were sent out with chariots and men. The Chethb &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is not to be altered, since there are other instances in which the first noun is written with the article, though in the construct state (vid., Ewald, 290, e.); and the Keri is only conformed to the following &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/7-14.htm">2 Kings 7:14</a>, <a href="/2_kings/7-15.htm">2 Kings 7:15</a>. They then sent out two chariots with horses, who pursued the flying enemy to the Jordan, and found the whole of the road full of traces of the hurried flight, consisting of clothes and vessels that had been thrown away. The Chethb &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1494;&#1501; is the only correct reading, since it is only in the Niphal that &#1495;&#1508;&#1494; has the meaning to fly in great haste (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>). </body></html>
