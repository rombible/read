Elisha’s prediction might give Satan an <span class="ital">occasion </span>of suggesting this villany to his mind; but, as Mr. Scott justly observes, “it was not the <span class="ital">cause </span>of his crime, and forms no excuse for it. Had he been of David’s disposition, he would have waited in the path of duty till the Lord had performed his word in that manner which pleased him.” Thus he soon began to manifest the rapaciousness and cruelty of the dog, of which he desired to be thought incapable. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:7-15 Among other changes of men's minds by affliction, it often gives other thoughts of God's ministers, and teaches to value the counsels and prayers of those whom they have hated and despised. It was not in Hazael's countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God revealed it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes: the more foresight men have, the more grief they are liable to. It is possible for a man, under the convictions and restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, yet afterwards to be reconciled to it. Those that are little and low in the world, cannot imagine how strong the temptations of power and prosperity are, which, if ever they arrive at, they will find how deceitful their hearts are, how much worse than they suspected. The devil ruins men, by saying they shall certainly recover and do well, so rocking them asleep in security. Hazael's false account was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of the prophet's warning to prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a false prophet. It is not certain that Hazael murdered his master, or if he caused his death it may have been without any design. But he was a dissembler, and afterwards proved a persecutor to Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hazael omitted the clause by which Elisha had shown how those words were to be understood.

The steadfast, penetrating look of the prophet seemed to have convinced Hazael that his secret designs were known. The deep emotions of Elisha were justified by the horrible atrocities which, too common in ancient warfare, that successful usurper committed in Israel (2Ki 10:32; 13:3, 4, 22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He represents the prophet’s answer by halves, that by his master’s security he might have the fitter opportunity to execute his reasonable design. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master,....

He had been treated as a man who would give a soft answer whatever the real message might be, and now he is sent away with the knowledge that the Lord sees all his policy. But he was a determined spirit, and the words of the prophet did not act as a check, but set him on a bolder course of villainy. He first acts the part that had been imputed to him, and with a lying tongue says ‘He told me thou shouldest surely recover’. After that he cannot wait for time to bring about what God had said would be, but by a short road comes to the throne after smothering his master.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee?

The <span class="accented">suppressio veri</span> is <span class="accented">a suggestio falsi</span>; and the suppression was Hazael's act, not Elisha's. Had Hazael repeated the whole of Elisha's answer, "Say unto him, Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit the Lord hath showed me that he shall surely die;" - Benhadad might have been puzzled, but he would not have been deceived. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elisha Predicts to Hazael at Damascus the Possession of the Throne. - <a href="/2_kings/8-7.htm">2 Kings 8:7</a>. Elisha then came to Damascus at the instigation of the Spirit of God, to carry out the commission which Elijah had received at Horeb with regard to Hazael (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15</a>). Benhadad king of Syria was sick at that time, and when Elisha's arrival was announced to him, sent Hazael with a considerable present to the man of God, to inquire of Jehovah through him concerning his illness. The form of the name &#1495;&#1494;&#1492;&#1488;&#1500; (here and <a href="/2_kings/8-15.htm">2 Kings 8:15</a>) is etymologically correct; but afterwards it is always written without .&#1492; &#1491;&#1501; &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; ("and that all kinds of good of Damascus") follows with a more precise description of the minchah - "a burden of forty camels." The present consisted of produce or wares of the rich commercial city of Damascus, and was no doubt very considerable; at the same time, it was not so large that forty camels were required to carry it. The affair must be judged according to the Oriental custom, of making a grand display with the sending of presents, and employing as many men or beasts of burden as possible to carry them, every one carrying only a single article (cf. Harmar, Beobb. ii. p. 29, iii. p. 43, and Rosenmller, A. u. N. Morgenl. iii. p. 17). </body></html>
