This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise to David (2Sa 7:16). A national chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom, which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler (2Ki 3:9; 1Ki 22:47), erected the standard of independence (2Ch 21:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Edom revolted; </span> for though Joram had given them a defeat, yet it may seem to have been no great slaughter, but only a putting them to flight; and therefore they might easily rally again.

The change is in conformity with Chronicles, because of the similarity of the Hebrew. Libnah was situate in the lowland between the mountains of Judah and the Mediterranean coast. It was a strong city with a king when the Israelites took it under Joshua (<a href="/context/joshua/10-29.htm" title="Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:...">Joshua 10:29-39</a>). It is mentioned afterwards (<a href="/2_kings/19-8.htm" title="So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.">2 Kings 19:8</a>) as besieged by Sennacherib. The narrative of the Chronicler adds as the reason of the revolt ‘because he [Joram] had forsaken the Lord the God of his fathers’. The revolt of Libnah does not seem to be connected in any way with that of Edom. The time was opportune and both Edomites and Libnites availed themselves of it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet Edom revolted</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and Edom revolted</span>; or, so <span class="accented">Edom</span> <span class="accented">revolted</span>. Joram's attempt having failed, the independence of the country was established. <span class="cmt_word">From under the hand of Judah unto this day.</span> The successes of Amaziah and Azariah against Edom (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7, 22</a>) did not amount to reconquests. Edom continued a separate country, not subject to Judaea, and frequently at war with it, until the time of John Hyrcanus, by whom it was subjugated. "Unto this day" means, at the most, until the time when the Books of Kings took their present shape, which was before the return from the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> Libnah was situated on the borders of Philistia, in the Shefelah, or low country, but towards its eastern edge. Its exact position is uncertain; but it is now generally thought to be identical with the modern <span class="accented">Tel-es-Safi</span>, between Gath and Ekron, about long. 34&deg; 50' E., Int. 31&deg; 38' N. It had been an independent city, with a king of its own, in the early Canaanite time (<a href="/joshua/10-30.htm">Joshua 10:30</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), but had been assigned to Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>), and had hitherto remained, so far as appears, contented with its position. Its people can scarcely have had any sympathy with the Edomites, and its revolt at this time can have had no close connection with the Edomite rebellion. Libnah's sympathies would be with Philistia, and the occasion of the revolt may have been the invasion of Judaea by the Philistines in the reign of Jehoram, of which the author of Chronicles speaks (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>), and in which Jehoram's sons were carried off. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Joram of Judah (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2-20</a>). - Joram became king in the fifth year of Joram of Israel, while Jehoshaphat his father was (still) king, the latter handing over the government to him two years before his death (see at <a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>), and reigned eight years, namely, two years to the death of Jehoshaphat and six years afterwards.<p>(Note: The words &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; have been improperly omitted by the Arabic and Syriac, and by Luther, Dathe, and De Wette from their translations; whilst Schulz, Maurer, Thenius, and others pronounce it a gloss.
