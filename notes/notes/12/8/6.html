It is well to foresee an evil, and wisdom, when we foresee it, to hide ourselves if we lawfully may do so. When the famine was over, she returned out of the land of the Philistines; that was no proper place for an Israelite, any longer than there was necessity for it. Time was when she dwelt so securely among her own people, that she had no occasion to be spoken for to the king; but there is much uncertainty in this life, so that things or persons may fail us which we most depend upon, and those befriend us which we think we shall never need. Sometimes events, small in themselves, prove of consequence, as here; for they made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative, when thus confirmed. It made him ready to grant her request, and to support a life which was given once and again by miracle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A certain officer - literally, "a certain eunuch" (margin).

They are ascribed to the court of David in Chronicles <a href="/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>; and we may conjecture that they were maintained by Solomon.

The providence of God so ordained that King Jehoram had been led to inquire, with great interest, into the miraculous deeds of Elisha, and that the prophet's servant was in the act of relating the marvellous incident of the restoration of the Shunammite's son when she made her appearance to prefer her request. The king was pleased to grant it; and a state officer was charged to afford her every facility in the recovery of her family possession out of the hands of the occupier.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The king asked the woman</span> concerning the truth of Gehazi’s relation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the king asked the woman, she told him,....
