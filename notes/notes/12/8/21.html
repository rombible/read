In the parallel passage of 2 Chronicles 21. we find ‘with his princes’ instead of ‘to Zair’, and as there is some similarity of sound between the two Hebrew forms, it has been thought by some that there is a mistake in Kings from some misreading of the scribe. Others have suggested that ‘Zair’ is for ‘Zoar’, through which place troops marching from Judæa into Edom would have to pass. Others with much more probability have taken Zair (<span class="greekheb">צעיר</span>), to be a miswriting for Seir (<span class="greekheb">שׂעיר</span>) the name of the mountain ridge which extends southward from the Dead Sea through the desert.

It was only by a sudden sally in the night time that he forced his way out, and escaped.

He invaded the country in full force, taking up a position at a place called Zair, which is not otherwise known. Zair (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) can scarcely be Zoar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), which, wherever it was, was certainly not in Edom; and it is hardly likely to be a corruption of "Seir" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>), since the utterly unknown <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> would scarcely be put by a copyist in the place of the well-known <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>. Moreover, if Mount Seir were intended, it would probably have had the prefix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-42.htm">1 Chronicles 4:42</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 22, 23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2, 3, 7, 15</a>.

The article has the force of the possessive pronoun. <span class="cmt_word">And he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about.</span> Josephus understands the writer to mean that Joram made his invasion by night, and smote the Edomites on all sides ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:5. &sect; 1); but it seems better to suppose, with most modern commentators, that the meaning is the following: Soon after Joram invaded the country, he found himself surrounded and blocked in by the Edomite troops, and could only save himself by a night attack, which was so far successful that he broke through the enemy's lines and escaped; his army, however, was so alarmed at the danger it had run, that it at once dispersed and returned home<span class="cmt_word">.

They too were "smitten," having probably taken the chief part in trying to prevent the escape. <span class="cmt_word">And the people fled into their tents</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dispersed to their homes. Compare the cry of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>), "To your tents, O Israel!" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when Hazael replied in feigned humility, What is thy servant, the dog (i.e., so base a fellow: for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; see at <a href="/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>), that he should do such great things? Elisha said to him, "Jehovah has shown thee to me as king over Aram;" whereupon Hazael returned to his lord, brought him the pretended answer of Elisha that he would live (recover), and the next day suffocated him with a cloth dipped in water. &#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, to plait or twist, literally, anything twisted; not, however, a net for gnats or flies (Joseph., J.
