This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise to David (2Sa 7:16). A national chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom, which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler (2Ki 3:9; 1Ki 22:47), erected the standard of independence (2Ch 21:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Alway, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">all days</span>, until the coming of the Messiah, as it is elsewhere limited and explained; for so long, and not longer, this succession might seem necessary for the making good of God’s promise and covenant made with David.

God had declared by Moses, "If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of  the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his  commandments and statutes, which I command thee this day; all these curses shall come upon thee  The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in  all that thou settest thine hand unto for to  do, <span class="accented">until thou be destroyed</span>, and until thou  perish quickly; because of the wickedness  of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken  me. The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, <span class="accented">until he have consumed thee from off the land</span>, whither thou goest to possess it. The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall  pursue thee <span class="accented">till thou perish</span>. And thy heaven which is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is underneath thee shall be iron.... The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten of thine enemies; thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and thou shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.... Thou shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee" (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-37</a>). The apostasy of Jeheram, and of the nation under him, was calculated to bring about the immediate fulfillment of all these threats, and would have done so but for a restraining cause. God had made promises to David, and to his seed after him (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29-37</a>, etc.), which would be unfulfilled if Judah's candlestick were at once removed. He had declared, "If thy children forsake my Law, and walk not in my statutes... I will visit their offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges. Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take away, nor suffer my truth to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips; I have sworn once by my holiness that I will not fail David." If he had now swept away the Jewish kingdom, he would have dealt more hardly with these who clave to David than with those that broke off from him. He would not have shown the "faithfulness" or the "mercy" which he had promised, he would have forgotten "the loving-kindnesses which he aware unto David in his truth" (<a href="/psalms/89-49.htm">Psalm 89:49</a>). Therefore he would not - he <span class="accented">could</span> not  - as yet "destroy Judah," with which, in point of fact, he bore for above three centuries longer, until at last the cup of their iniquities was full, and "there was no remedy." <span class="cmt_word">As he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.</span> There is no "and" in the original. Translate -  <span class="accented">As he promised him to give him always a light in respect of his children</span>, and compare, for the promise of "a light" (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; and <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when Hazael replied in feigned humility, What is thy servant, the dog (i.e., so base a fellow: for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; see at <a href="/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>), that he should do such great things?
