On the strength of the words in this verse ‘Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah’ it is supposed that Jehoram king of Judah was co-regent with his father. But, as is noted on the margin of R.V., some ancient authorities omit the sentence which makes father and son to be reigning together. The chief difficulty is introduced by the words of <a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm" title="So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.">2 Kings 1:17</a>, which make Joram the son of Ahab commence his reign in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat of Judah. That statement contradicts the present verse, and the explanation given on <a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm" title="So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.">2 Kings 1:17</a> though generally accepted gives rise to many questions. Especially it is objected that in no other instance is a son found reigning along with his father. Then Jehoshaphat was a vigorous monarch and zealous for the service of Jehovah, and was not likely to take as his coadjutor a prince of so weak a character, and of such different religious feeling as Jehoram. Still no more satisfactory solution has been suggested.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-24.</span> - THE WICKED REIGN OF JEHORAM IN JUDAH. At this point the writer, who has been concerned with the history of the kingdom of Israel hitherto in the present book, takes up the story of the kingdom of Judah from <a href="/1_kings/22-50.htm">1 Kings 22:50</a>, and proceeds to give a very brief account of the reign of Jehoshaphat's eldest son, Jehoram, or (by contraction) Joram. His narrative has to be supplemented from <a href="/2_chronicles/21.htm">2 Chronicles 21</a>, which contains many facts not mentioned by the writer of Kings. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab King of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then King of Judah</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and of Jehoshaphat King of Judah</span>. The words are wanting in three Hebrew manuscripts, in some editions of the Septuagint, in the Peshito Syriac, in the Parisian Heptaplar Syriac, in the Arabic Version, and in many copies of the Vulgate. They cannot possibly have the sense assigned to them in our version, and are most probably a gloss which has crept into the text from the margin. <span class="cmt_word">Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat King of Judah began to reign.</span> Jehoram's reign was sometimes counted from the seventeenth year of his father, when he was given the royal title, sometimes from his father's twenty-third year, when he was associated, and sometimes from his father's death in his twenty-fifth year, when he became sole king (see the comment on 2 Kings 1:17 and <a href="/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>According to the Chethb &#1495;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1488;, Elisha's answer was, "Thou wilt not live, and (for) Jehovah has shown me that he will die;" according to the Keri &#1495;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1493;, "tell him: Thou wilt live, but Jehovah," etc. Most of the commentators follow the ancient versions, and the Masoretes, who reckon our &#1500;&#1488; among the fifteen passages of the O.T. in which it stands for the pronoun &#1500;&#1493; (vid., Hilleri Arcan. Keri, p. 62f.), and some of the codices, and decide in favour of the Keri. (1) because the conjecture that &#1500;&#1493; was altered into &#1500;&#1488; in order that Elisha might not be made to utter an untruth, is a very natural one; and (2) on account of the extreme rarity with which a negative stands before the inf. abs. with the finite verb following. But there is not much force in either argument. The rarity of the position of &#1500;&#1488; before the inf. abs. followed by a finite verb, in connection with the omission of the pronoun &#1500;&#1493; after &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, might be the very reason why &#1500;&#1488; was taken as a pronoun; and the confirmation of this opinion might be found in the fact that Hazael brought back this answer to the king: "Thou wilt live" (<a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a>). The reading in the text &#1500;&#1488; (non) is favoured by the circumstance that it is the more difficult of the two, partly because of the unusual position of the negative, and partly because of the contradiction to <a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a>. But the &#1500;&#1488; is found in the same position in other passages (<a href="/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>, and <a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8</a>), where the emphasis lies upon the negation; and the contradiction to <a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a> may be explained very simply, from the fact that Hazael did not tell his king the truth, because he wanted to put him to death and usurp the throne. We therefore prefer the reading in the text, since it is not in harmony with the character of the prophets to utter an untruth; and the explanation, "thou wilt not die of thine illness, but come to a violent death," puts into the words a meaning which they do not possess. For even if Benhadad did not die of his illness, he did not recover from it. </body></html>
