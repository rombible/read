A temple to that idol was erected at Ekron, which was resorted to far and wide, though it afterwards led to the destruction of the place (Zec 9:5; Am 1:8; Zep 2:4). "After visiting Ekron, 'the god of flies' is a name that gives me no surprise.

Which was either a window or lattice in the form of network, to let in light; or rather were the rails of a balcony or battlement on the roof of his palace, in this form, on which leaning, it broke down, and he fell into the garden or court yard; or walking on the roof of his house, and treading unawares on a sky light, which let in light into a room underneath, he fell through it into it: <p>and was sick; the fall perhaps threw him into a fever, and which seemed threatening, being violent: <p>and he sent messengers, and said unto them, go inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this disease; not to heal him of it, but to know the issue of it; a vain curiosity this! Ekron was one of the principalities of the Philistines, and this idol was the god they worshipped, which signifies a master fly: which some think was a large metallic fly; made under a planet that rules over flies; and the Heathens had deities they called Myiodes, Myagros, and  which signifies a driver away of flies; as Jupiter and Hercules were called by the Eleans and Romans, and worshipped and sacrificed to by them on that account (a); and so the Cyreneans, a people of Lybia, worshipped the god Achor, which seems to be a corruption of the word Ekron, because he freed them from flies, after they had been infested with a pestilence through them (b); and Ekron being a place near the sea, and both hot and moist, might be much infested with those creatures.

As it is said the king fell <span class="ital">through</span> it, we may most probably conclude that an Oriental window space with its trellis-work is intended. The description of it as ‘in his upper chamber’ shews that it cannot have been a palisade round the flat roof of the house, as some have thought, which broke away as he was leaning on it, and let him fall down. Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 2. 1) represents the king as having fallen as he was coming down from the housetop.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and was sick</span>] The verb is employed, as here, of sickness caused by wounds, and also of ordinary disease (cf. <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm" title="Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.">2 Kings 13:14</a>) as in the case of Elisha. It is also used metaphorically (cf. <a href="/songs/2-5.htm" title="Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>; <a href="/songs/5-8.htm" title="I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him, that I am sick of love.">Song of Solomon 5:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron</span>] The son of Jezebel follows his mother’s example in his adherence to false gods. It was probably because Ekron was the nearest shrine of such a divinity that Ahaziah was sending thither. Ekron was the most northern of the five great Philistine cities, and so most easily within reach from Samaria. It is not possible to say, from the form of the two Hebrew words which make up the name Baal-zebub, whether they are in construction or in apposition. The latter word signifies ‘a fly’, and the LXX. taking them as in apposition rendered ‘Baal, the fly’, as though the image of the god had been in that form, just as Dagon’s image, in the neighbouring Ashdod, was in part at least like a fish. But it seems more natural to regard the words as in construction, so that ‘the Baal (or lord) of flies’ would be an epithet implying that the god was supposed to be an averter of flies, these insects being, especially in hot countries, a very serious pest. Such among the Greeks was <span class="greekheb">Ζεὺς ἀπόμυιος</span> (Paus. v. 14. 2), and among the Romans a deity supposed to possess this fly-dispelling power was named ‘Myiagrus’ and ‘Myiodes’ = the fly catcher. (Plin. x. 28. 40; xxix. 6. 34.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whether I shall recover of this disease</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">sickness</span>. The noun is from the same root as the verb rendered ‘was sick’, just before. There must have been some oracle at Ekron, for it was an answer that Ahaziah sought. He did not send his messengers to make supplication for his recovery. The LXX. adds at the close of this verse ‘and they went to inquire concerning him’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahaziah fell down through a lattice</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through the lattice</span>. It is implied that the <span class="cmt_word">upper chamber</span> had a single window, which was closed by a single <span class="accented">lattice</span>, or shutter of interlaced woodwork. The shutter may have been insufficiently secured; or the woodwork may have been too weak to bear his weight, Compare the fall of Eutychus (<a href="/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>), where, however, there is no mention of a "lattice." <span class="cmt_word">Was sick</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "was so injured that he had to take to his bed." <span class="cmt_word">Inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron.</span> As a worshipper of Baal, bent on walking in the evil way of his father and of his mother (<a href="/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>), Ahaziah would naturally inquire of some form of the Baal divinity. Why he chose "Baal-zebub the god of Ekron," it is impossible to say. Perhaps Baal-zebub had at the time a special reputation for giving oracular responses. Perhaps the Ekron temple was, of all the ancient sites of the Baal-worship, the one with which he could most readily communicate. Philistia lay nearer to Samaria than Phoenicia did, and of the Philistine towns Ekron (now <span class="accented">Akir</span>) was the most northern, and so the nearest. "Baal-zebub" has been thought by some to be equivalent to "Beel-samen," "the lord of heaven" - a divine title well known to the Phoenicians; but this view is etymologically unsound, since <span class="accented">zebub</span> cannot possibly mean "heaven." "Baal-zebub" is "the lord of flies " - either the god who sends them as a plague on any nation that offends him (setup. <a href="/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21-31</a>), or the god who averts them from his votaries and favorites, an equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or the Roman "Jupiter Myiagrus," flies being in the East not infrequently a terrible plague.

When the ships had been broken in pieces in Eziongeber, no doubt by a storm, Ahaziah made this fresh proposal to him: "Let my people sail with thy people;" but Jehoshaphat would not. Ahaziah evidently wanted to persuade Jehoshaphat to make another attempt, after the destruction of the ships which were first built; but Jehoshaphat did not agree to it any more, because it was impossible for him, after the fulfilment of Eliezer's prediction, to expect a more favourable result. Thus the two accounts can be harmonized in a very simple manner, with the exception of the words "to go to Tarshish," which we find in the Chronicles in the place of "to go to Ophir," the reading in our text, and which sprang from an erroneous interpretation of the expression "ships of Tarshish" (see above, pp. 105f). The Chethb &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is an error of the pen for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (Keri); but &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (Chethb) is not to be altered into &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, since the construction of a singular verb with the subject following in the plural is by no means rare (vid., Ewald, 317, a.).
