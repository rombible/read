Sin weakens and impoverishes us. Man's revolt from God is often punished by the rebellion of those who owe subjection to him. Ahaziah fell through a lattice, or railing. Wherever we go, there is but a step between us and death. A man's house is his castle, but not to secure him against God's judgments. The whole creation, which groans under the burden of man's sin, will, at length, sink and break under the weight like this lattice. He is never safe that has God for his enemy.

This angel commissioned Elijah to meet the king's messengers, to stop them peremptorily on the idolatrous errand, and convey by them to the king information of his approaching death. This consultation of an idol, being a breach of the fundamental law of the kingdom (Ex 20:3; De 5:7), was a daring and deliberate rejection of the national religion. The Lord, in making this announcement of his death, designed that he should see in that event a judgment for his idolatry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is it not because there is not a God in Israel?</span> Dost thou not by this action cast contempt upon the God of Israel, as if he were either ignorant of the event of thy disease, or un able to give thee any relief, and as if Baal-zebub had more skill and power than he? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah,....

The Hebrew could employ a double negative, as the Greek sometimes does, but the sense intended is given in English by the single one. This rendering the A.V. employs in <a href="/exodus/14-11.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? why have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?">Exodus 14:11</a> where the original is in the same form as in the verse before us: ‘Because there were no graves in Egypt’; and for a similar double negative in the Hebrew of <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm" title="He has made every thing beautiful in his time: also he has set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end.">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a> the A.V. gives ‘so that no man can find out’.

An angel had appeared to Elijah on a previous occasion (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Elijah the Tishbite</span> (comp. <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-17.htm">1 Kings 21:17, 28</a>; <a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>; and for the meaning of the expression, <span class="accented">hat-Tishbi</span>, see the comment on 1 Kings 17:1). <span class="cmt_word">Arise, go up.</span> Elijah was, apparently, in the low tract of the Shefelah, or in Sharon, when the messengers started, and was thus commanded to go up and meet them, or intercept them on their journey before they descended into the plain. God would not have the insult to his majesty, carried out. <span class="cmt_word">Is it not because there is not a God in Israel?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Is it that there is no God at all in Israel</span>? The double negative is intensitive, and implies that the king's consultation of Baal-zebub, god of Ekron, is a complete and absolute denial of the Divinity of Jehovah. To consult a foreign oracle is equivalent to raying that the voice of God is wholly silent in one's own land. This was going further in apostasy than Ahab had gone (see <a href="/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6-9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The brief notice concerning Jehoshaphat's attempt to build Tarshish ships (for the word, see pp. 105f) for the voyage to Ophir is expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36-37</a>, where we learn that Jehoshaphat had allied himself with Ahaziah of Israel for this purpose, and that the prophet Eliezer predicted the destruction of his ships on account of this alliance. When the ships had been broken in pieces in Eziongeber, no doubt by a storm, Ahaziah made this fresh proposal to him: "Let my people sail with thy people;" but Jehoshaphat would not. Ahaziah evidently wanted to persuade Jehoshaphat to make another attempt, after the destruction of the ships which were first built; but Jehoshaphat did not agree to it any more, because it was impossible for him, after the fulfilment of Eliezer's prediction, to expect a more favourable result. Thus the two accounts can be harmonized in a very simple manner, with the exception of the words "to go to Tarshish," which we find in the Chronicles in the place of "to go to Ophir," the reading in our text, and which sprang from an erroneous interpretation of the expression "ships of Tarshish" (see above, pp. 105f). The Chethb &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is an error of the pen for &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (Keri); but &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (Chethb) is not to be altered into &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, since the construction of a singular verb with the subject following in the plural is by no means rare (vid., Ewald, 317, a.).
