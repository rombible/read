It appears, by the testimony of many authors, that among several nations horses were dedicated to the sun, as hawks and some other creatures were, because of the swiftness of their motions. Thus the ancient Persians consecrated white horses and chariots to the sun, as Xenophon testifies, and with them were wont to adorn their processions. See Hyde’s <span class="ital">Relig. Ver.

What convinces us further that these were real chariots, drawn by horses, and bearing some image of the sun, is, that the text expressly says, that Josiah did not burn the chariots and horses, as he would have done if they had been only carved and painted, but that he <span class="ital">took away the horses, and burned the chariots. </span>Bochart supposes that these horses and chariots were designed to carry the king and his great officers out at the east gate of the city every morning, to salute and adore the sun, at his coming above the horizon, according to the custom of the Persian idolaters.” <span class="ital">At the entering in of the house of the Lord — </span>By the gate of the outward court of the temple. <span class="ital">By the chamber of the chamberlain — </span>Or <span class="ital">officer, </span>to whom the care of these horses was committed. <span class="ital">Which was in the suburbs — </span>Of the temple; in certain outward buildings belonging to the temple.

Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great.

There are no traces of it in Assyria; and it is extremely curious to find that it was known to the Jews as early as the reign of Manasseh. The idea of regarding the Sun as a charioteer who drove his horses daily across the sky, so familiar to the Greeks and Romans, may not improbably have been imported from Asia, and may have been at the root of the custom in question. The chariot, or chariots, of the Sun appear to have been used, chiefly if not solely, for sacred processions. They were white, and were drawn probably by white horses. The kings of Judah who gave them were Manasseh and Amon certainly; perhaps Ahaz; perhaps even earlier monarchs, as Joash and Amaziah.<p>In the suburbs - The expression used here &#1508;&#1512;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  parba&#772;r&#305;&#770;ym is of unknown derivation and occurs nowhere else.

In some cases these horses were sacrificed; but more commonly they were employed either in the sacred processions to carry the images of the sun, or for the worshippers to ride in every morning to welcome his rise. It seems that the idolatrous kings, Ahaz, Manasseh, and Amon, or their great officers, proceeded on these horses early on each day from the east gate of the temple to salute and worship the sun at his appearing above the horizon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The horses; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Consecrated to it; these were not images of horses, as some have thought, but real living ones; and the kings that gave them for the service of the sun, and for sacrifice to it, very probably were Manasseh and Amon: that horses were sacred to the sun with many Heathen nations, as the Massagetae, a people in Scythia, and the Persians, and Babylonians, and Ethiopians, is affirmed by various writers (c): and from them the Jews received this notion. According to the Jewish commentators, these were horses provided for the worshippers of the sun to ride upon, and meet the sun in the morning at its rising, and pay their homage to it; but certain it is that the Heathen nations before mentioned slew the horses, and sacrificed them as burnt offerings to the sun, as is asserted by Herodotus (d), Xenophon (e), Strabo (f), Pausanias (g), Philostratus (h), and other writers (i); and so the Indians of India (k) sacrificed them to Apollo, the same with the sun; these being the swiftest of creatures, they offered them to the swiftest of their gods, as Herodotus and Heliodorus observe, in the places before referred to. The stables in which these horses were kept were <p>at the entering of the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs; so that they reached from the temple to the suburbs of Jerusalem, to that part of them where this officer had a chamber, or lodgings, being in some place of power and authority there; though, according to L'Empereur (l), it is the same with Parbar, <a href="/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a> and should not be rendered "suburbs", it being between the compass or wall of the temple, and the court: <p>and burnt the chariots of the sun with fire; these were either chariots, in which the king and his nobles rode, when they went to meet and worship the rising sun; or rather such as were sacred to the sun, as well as the horses, or Josiah would not have burnt them; they seem to be such in which the images of the sun were carried. Herodotus (m) makes mention as of sacred horses, so of a sacred chariot. Xenophon (n) speaks of the chariot of the sun as being of a white colour, and drawn in procession at the worship of the sun; as does also Pausanias (o) of a chariot, in which were the sun, Jupiter, and Juno, and near them other deities; which notion of sacred chariots the Heathens might take from the chariot of the cherubim Jehovah sat and rode in, <a href="/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>. <p>(c) Justin e Trogo, l. 1. c. 10.

The idea of the sun-god as a charioteer, who drove his horses daily across the sky, is one common to several of the Aryan nations, as the Greeks, the Romans, the Hindoos, and others;but we do not find it either in Egypt or among the Semitic peoples. The sacrifice of the horse to the sun was more general (Herod., 1:216; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:3. &sect; 24; 'Anab.,' 4:5. &sect; 35; Rig Veda, vol. 2. pp. 112, <span class="accented">et seqq</span>., etc.), but does not seem to have been adopted by the Hebrews.

Thes. p. 693), and the explanation given by Frst from vi occultandi magicasque, h. e. arcanas et reconditas artes exercendi, and others given in Iden's Dissertatt. theol. philol. i. diss. 12, are quite untenable.)<p>The singular &#1493;&#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; is striking, inasmuch as if the imperf. c. Vav rel. were a continuation of &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, we should expect the plural, "and who had burnt incense," as it is given in the Chaldee. The lxx, Vulg., and Syr. have rendered &#1500;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;, from which &#1493;&#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512; has probably arisen by a mistake in copying. In the following clause, "and those who had burnt incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon," etc., Baal is mentioned as the deity worshipped in the sun, the moon, and the stars (see at <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>). &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, synonymous with &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>, does not mean the twenty-eight naxatra, or Indian stations of the moon,<p>(Note: According to A. Weber, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den naxatra, in the Abhandlungen der Berl. Acad. d. Wiss. 1860 and 1861. Compare, on the other hand, Steinschneider, Hebr. Bibliographie, 1861, No. 22, pp. 93, 94, his article in the Deutsch. morgld. Zeitschrift, 1864, p. 118ff.)<p>but the twelve signs or constellations of the zodiac, which were regarded by the Arabs as mena&#770;zil, i.e., station-houses, in which the sun took up its abode in succession when describing the circuit of the year (cf. Ges. Thes. p. 869, and Delitzsch on <a href="/job/38-32.htm">Job 38:32</a>).</body></html>
