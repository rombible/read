Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great.

This range has three summits, of which the central one is the Mount of Corruption, so called from the idol temples built there, and of course the hill on the right hand denotes the southernmost peak. Josiah is said not to have destroyed, but only defiled, "the high places on the hill of corruption."

It is called in the Vulgate rendering of this verse ‘Mons offensionis’, and so the hill is spoken of in Christian writings as ‘the Mount of Offence’. The word rendered ‘corruption’ is also often translated ‘destruction’ (see marg.), and this name is equally applicable, from the ruinous and destructive results which developed out of this introduction of idolatry by Solomon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ashtoreth</span>] On <span class="ital">Ashtoreth, Chemosh</span> and <span class="ital">Milcom</span>, and the temples which Solomon built for them under the influence of his heathen wives, see the notes on <a href="/context/1_kings/11-4.htm" title="For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father....">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the high places that were before Jerusalem.</span> The high places which Solomon established in the neighborhood of Jerusalem for the use of his wives, and in the worship at which he became himself entangled in his old age, appear to have been situated on the ridge of the mountain which lies over against Jerusalem to the east, a part of which is Olivet. The southern summit, the traditional roans <span class="accented">offensionis</span>, was probably the high place of Moloch (Milcom), while the most northern summit (now called <span class="accented">Karem-es-Seyad</span>) has some claim to be regarded as the high place of Chemosh. (So Broeardus in A.D. .) The site of the high place of Ashtoreth is doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">Which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption.</span> The name "mount of corruption" seems to have been given after Solomon's time to the entire ridge of hills which lies over against Jerusalem to the east, on account of the rites which he had allowed to be established on it. The "right hand" of the mountain would, according to Jewish notions, be the more southern part. <span class="cmt_word">Which Solomon the King of Israel</span> - rather, <span class="accented">King of Israel</span>, since there is no article - <span class="cmt_word">had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians</span> (see <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>). Though Ashtoreth, or Astarte, or Ishtar, or the Dea Syra, was worshipped generally throughout Phoenicia, and perhaps even more widely, yet she was in a peculiar way "the abomination of the Zidonians," being the deity to whom the city of Sidon was especially dedicated (see the inscription on the tomb of Eshmunazar, published in the 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 113, 114). <span class="cmt_word">And for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites.</span> Chemosh appears as the special god of the Moabites on the famous Moabite Stone in eleven places. The stone itself was dedicated to Chemosh (line 3). The Moabites are spoken of as "the people of Chemosh" (lines 5, 6). Success in war comes from him, and defeat is the result of his anger. One of his designations is "Ashtar-Chemosh" (line 17), or "Chemosh, who is also Ashtar," Ashtar being the male principle corresponding to the female Astarte or Ashtoreth. <span class="cmt_word">And for Milcom.</span> Moloch was called by the Jews "Milcom," or "Malcam" - "their king" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the king of the Ammonite people, since he was the sole god whom they acknowledged (see <a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a> compared with <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>; <a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The abomination of the children of Ammon</span> (see <a href="/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5, 7</a>; and compare the comment on 1 Kings in the 'Pulpit Commentary,' p. 222). <span class="cmt_word">Did the king defile.</span> The manner of the defilement is stated in the next verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, the houses (places of abode) of the paramours (for &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; see at <a href="/1_kings/14-24.htm">1 Kings 14:24</a>), were probably only tents or huts, which were erected in the court of the temple for the paramours to dwell in, and in which there were also women who wove tent-temples (&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;) for Asherah (see at <a href="/2_kings/17-30.htm">2 Kings 17:30</a>).<p>(Note: On this worship Movers has the following among other remarks (Phn. i. p. 686): "The mutilated Gallus (&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;) fancies that he is a woman: negant se viros esse ... muleires se volunt credi (Firmic.). He lives in close intimacy with the women, and they again are drawn towards the Galli by peculiar affection."
