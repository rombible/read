This variation is no doubt due to the different state of things which existed when the two books were compiled. In the days of the compiler of Kings, the effect of the schools of the prophets had not died away, and he could understand that men who had belonged to them would in Josiah’s time form a considerable class, and be mentioned as such in the original record. When the Chronicler lived things were very different. Prophets, as a class of men trained in religious societies with a view to future work among the people, had ceased to exist, while the Levites had come into considerable prominence. Meaning therefore to represent the influential persons of the time as present at Josiah’s solemn gathering, he mentions ‘Levites’ who in his own time were a distinguished body, omitting ‘prophets’ as they were no longer found in the same numbers, nor constituted so distinct a class, when this assembly was collected in Josiah’s reign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">small and great</span>] i.e. The poor and the rich.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the book of the covenant</span>] The expression is found in <a href="/exodus/24-7.htm" title="And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.">Exodus 24:7</a>, and there seems to refer to the contents of the chapters Exodus 20-23. But there is little doubt that, however brief the first form of statutes may have been to which this name was given, it came in time to include the additional laws of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, and that to some such expanded set of laws the name is here applied.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king went up into the house of the Lord.</span> No place could be so suitable for the renewal of the covenant between God and his people as the house of God, where God was in a peculiar way present, and the ground was, like the ground at Horeb, holy. Josiah "went up" to the temple from the royal palace, which was on a lower level (comp. <a href="/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him.</span> Not only the "elders," who had been summoned, but of the people, as many as chose to attend, besides. The gathering was no doubt great; but the expressions used are (as with the Orientals generally) hyperbolical. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests, and the prophets.</span> The representation would have been incomplete without these two classes - the priests, the ordinary and regular readers (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11</a>) and teachers (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>) of the Law; and the prophets, the extraordinary and occasional teachers, inspired from time to time, and commissioned to enforce the Law, and futile to declare God's will to the people. <span class="cmt_word">And all the people, both small and great</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. without distinction of classes - all ranks of the people, high and low, rich and poor, noble and base-born.

If a king might, like Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22-61</a>), lead the prayers of the congregation of Israel in the temple, much more might he read the Law to them. The readers in the Jewish synagogues are ordinarily lay people. <span class="cmt_word">All the words of the book of the covenant.</span> Perhaps there is here some exaggeration, as in the phrases, "<span class="accented">all</span> the men of Judah," and "<span class="accented">all</span> the inhabitants of Jerusalem." The entire Pentateuch could scarcely be read through in less than ten hours. Possibly, the Book of Deuteronomy was alone read. <span class="cmt_word">Which was found in the house of the Lord</span> (see above, <a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The reply of Huldah the prophetess. - Huldah confirmed the fear expressed by Josiah, that the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Jerusalem and its inhabitants on account of their idolatry, and proclaimed first of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-16.htm">2 Kings 22:16</a>, <a href="/2_kings/22-17.htm">2 Kings 22:17</a>), that the Lord would bring upon Jerusalem and its inhabitants all the punishments with which the rebellious and idolaters are threatened in the book of the law; and secondly (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18-20</a>), to the king himself, that on account of his sincere repentance and humiliation in the sight of God, he would not live to see the predicted calamities, but would be gathered to his fathers in peace. The first part of her announcement applies "to the man who has sent you to me" (<a href="/2_kings/22-15.htm">2 Kings 22:15</a>), the second "to the king of Judah, who has sent to inquire of the Lord" (<a href="/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18</a>). "The man" who had sent to her was indeed also the king; but Huldah intentionally made use of the general expression "the man," etc., to indicate that the word announced to him applied not merely to the king, but to every one who would hearken to the word, whereas the second portion of her reply had reference to the king alone. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-16.htm">2 Kings 22:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>, is Jerusalem as the capital of the kingdom.

"With all the work of their hands," i.e., with the idols which they have made for themselves (cf. <a href="/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>). The last clause in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18</a>, "the words which thou hast heard," is not to be connected with the preceding one, "thus saith the Lord," and &#1506;&#1500; or &#1500; to be supplied; but it belongs to the following sentence, and is placed at the head absolutely: as for the words, which thou hast heart - because thy heart has become soft, i.e., in despair at the punishment with which the sinners are threatened (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-3.htm">Deuteronomy 20:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>), and thou hast humbled thyself, when thou didst hear, etc.; therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, etc. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, "that they (the city and inhabitants) may become a desolation and curse." These words, which are often used by the prophets, but which are not found connected like this except in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22</a>, rest upon <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, and show that these passages had been read to the king out of the book of the law. </body></html>
