Josiah had reigned eighteen years, and had himself set the people a good example, and kept up religion according to the Divine law; yet, when he came to search for idolatry, the depth and extent were very great.

It seems that at some of the shrines dedicated to the false gods, instead of more permanent erections, tents were put up, and it was for these that the women were employed in weaving curtains. The Hebrew word rendered ‘hangings’ is the same which is used in other passages for ‘houses’ of the high places. The Jewish tradition explains it by ‘curtains’. Some have thought that the ‘tabernacles’ alluded to in <a href="/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a> were of this character, tent-like erections which could be moved when not in use. Another allusion to such curtained structures for idolatrous worship is found in <a href="/ezekiel/16-16.htm" title="And of your garments you did take, and decked your high places with divers colors, and played the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.">Ezekiel 16:16</a>. ‘Of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy high places with divers colours’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brake down the houses of the sodomites</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of the</span> consecrated ones. (See the comment on 1 Kings 14:24; and note that the male prostitutes, or Galli, who consecrated themselves to the Des Syra, formed an essential element in the Astarte-worship, and accompanied it wherever it was introduced.) Dollinger says ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. pp. 430, 431) of these wretched persons, "To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement, and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose. Thereupon they ran with the mutilated part through the city, and received from the houses which they threw them into, a woman's gear. Not chastity, but barrenness, was intended by the mutilation. In this the Galli only desired to be like their goddess. The relation of foul lust, which they thenceforward occupied towards women, was regarded as a holy thing, and was tolerated by husbands in their wives." <span class="cmt_word">That were by the house of the Lord.</span> The near vicinity is an indication that the Galli took part in the foreign rites introduced into the temple by Manasseh and Amon. The awful profanation of the house of God by such orgies is too terrible to dwell on. <span class="cmt_word">Where the women wove hangings for the grove.</span> "The women" are no doubt the priestesses of the Dea Syra, who are constantly mentioned with the Galli, and, indeed, lived with them. They employed themselves, among other occupations, in weaving "hangings" (literally, "houses," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "coverings") for the Asherah. It may be gathered from <a href="/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a> that these "coverings" were dainty fabrics of many colors. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reading of the law in the temple, and renewal of the covenant (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-29.htm">2 Chronicles 34:29-32</a>). Beside the priests, Josiah also gathered together the prophets, including perhaps Jeremiah and Zedekiah, that he might carry out the solemn conclusion of the covenant with their co-operation, and, as is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1-11</a>, that they might then undertake the task, by their impressive preaching in Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, of making the people conscious of the earnestness of the covenant duties which they had so recently undertaken (see Oehler in Herzog's Cycl.). Instead of the prophets, the Levites are mentioned in the Chronicles, probably only because the Levites are mentioned along with the priests in other cases of a similar kind. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, he read, i.e., had it read; for the duty of reading the law in the temple devolved upon the priests as the keepers of the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>.).</body></html>
