He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour.

Josiah saw that it was necessary, not only to put down open idolatry, but also to root out the secret practices of a similar character which were sometimes combined with the worship of Yahweh, notwithstanding that the Law forbade them (marginal references), and which probably formed, with many, practically almost the whole of their religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21-23. the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord your God, &c.&#8212;It was observed with great solemnity and was attended not only by his own subjects, but by the remnant people from Israel (see on [355]2Ch 35:1-19). Many of the Israelites who were at Jerusalem might have heard of, if they did not hear, the law read by Josiah. It is probable that they might even have procured a copy of the law, stimulated as they were to the better observance of Jehovah's worship by the unusual and solemn transactions at Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The wizards; </span> of which see on <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm" title="Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:31</a> 20:27 <a href="/numbers/22-5.htm" title="He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:">Numbers 22:5</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deu 18:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The images, and the idols, </span> and all the abominations; three words noting the same thing, to show that till the instruments and monuments of idolatry were destroyed, as God had commanded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That were spied, </span> i.e. all that were discovered; not only such as were in the place and state of worship, but such as their priests or zealots had removed, and endeavoured to hide and secure. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,....

What Josiah desired was not only to carry out on this occasion the prescription of the Law, but so to establish the observance that it should continue and not be lightly modified. There is no mention of the passover held in the nineteenth year and in the succeeding years of Josiah’s reign. It would be rash, however, to conclude from such absence of the record, that the same solemnity was not used every succeeding year of the king’s reign, almost as rash as to decide that the passover had been unobserved since the time of Samuel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ordinances for putting down them that had familiar spirits and other like superstitions are found in <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm" title="Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm" title="And the soul that turns after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm" title="A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:27</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards.</span> Persons of these classes had been encouraged by Manasseh, in his earlier reign (<a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>), and probably by Amon (<a href="/2_kings/21-21.htm">2 Kings 21:21</a>).

The superstition was exceedingly persistent. We find it under the judges (<a href="/judges/18-14.htm">Judges 18:14</a>), under Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>), here under the later kings, and it is still mentioned after the return from the Captivity (<a href="/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>). The superstition was, apparently, Babylonian (<a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>), and brought from Ur of the Chaldees by the family of Abraham.
