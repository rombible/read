The verb signifies ‘to carry in a chariot’. The R.V. prints in common type. According to the Chronicler, they moved him from his war chariot into a second chariot which he had at hand. From <a href="/zechariah/12-11.htm" title="In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.">Zechariah 12:11</a> ‘As the mourning of Hadad-Rimmon in the valley of Megiddo’ it has been supposed that Josiah did not die till he reached Hadad-Rimmon, and that the mourning there mentioned by the prophet was for this good king’s death. The Chronicler dwells at length on the sorrow which this event caused. ‘Jeremiah lamented for him, and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day’. Some have thought that the lamentation here spoken of is preserved to us in the poem contained in Lamentations 4. But there is hardly anything in it which can be taken as clear allusion to this time. Jeremiah’s dirge for Josiah has probably perished with much other literature of the period.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jehoahaz … and anointed him</span>] To anoint a king who succeeded in the ordinary way was not usual. Hence some have thought that the people of the land were not acting according to what Josiah himself would have wished, nor choosing the recognised successor in passing over the elder brother. They wished therefore, by this solemn rite, to ensure his acceptance as their religiously consecrated monarch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It appears from the history in Kings that Eliakim (Jehoiakim) was older than Jehoahaz, because on Eliakim’s succession he is stated to have been 25 years old, while Jehoahaz, whose reign was only of three months’ duration, is said to have been 23 when he came to the throne (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm" title="Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.">2 Kings 23:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm" title="Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.">2 Kings 23:36</a>). But in the genealogy (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>) the sons of Josiah are put down as ‘the firstborn Johanan (and this the margin of A.V. identifies with Jehoahaz), the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum’. If the margin of A.V. is correct then Jehoahaz would have succeeded in his proper place. But he is called Shallum in <a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm" title="For thus said the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:">Jeremiah 22:11</a>, and so he would be, according to the Chronicler, the fourth son.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his servants carried him in a chariot</span> - his "second chariot," according to the writer of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24</a>), which was probably one kept in reserve in case flight should be necessary, of lighter construction, and drawn by fleeter horses, than his war-chariot - <span class="cmt_word">dead from Megiddo.</span> Wounded to death, that is. From Chronicles we gather that his wound, which was from an arrow, was not immediately fatal (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-23.htm">2 Chronicles 35:23, 24</a>); but that he died of it on his way to Jerusalem, or directly after his arrival. <span class="cmt_word">And brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18</a> and 26). The writer of Chronicles says, "in the sepulcher of his fathers," apparently meaning the burial-place in which were interred the bodies of Manasseh and Amen. We learn from Chronicles that a great lamentation was made for Josiah, the only King of Judah slain in battle, the last good king of David's line, the pious prince whose piety had not sufficed to avert the anger of Jehovah. Jeremiah "lamented for him" (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>), perhaps in a set composition (Josephus, ' Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 1); though that composition is certainly not either the Book of Lamentations or the fourth chapter of that book. He was further mourned by "all the singing men and the singing women" (2 Chronicles, <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), who "spake of him in their lamentations, and "made them an ordinance in Israel," and entered these "lamentations," apparently in a book, which was called 'The Book of Lamentations,' or 'of Dirges.' <span class="cmt_word">And the people of the laud took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah.</span> Jehoahaz was otherwise named "Shallum" (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>). On what grounds the people preferred him to his elder brother, Eliakim, we do not know.

As Josiah had the passover kept in perfect accordance with the precepts of the law, so did he also exterminate the necromancers, the teraphim and all the abominations of idolatry, throughout all Judah and Jerusalem, to set up the words of the law in the book of the law that had been found, i.e., to carry them out and bring them into force.

See the remarks on this point at <a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>. He turned to Jehovah with all his heart, etc.: there is an evident allusion here to <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>.
