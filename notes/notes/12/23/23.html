As Ewald says, the meaning of these two verses is, that the passover was never so celebrated before, especially as regards (1) the offerings over and above the paschal lamb (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-2.htm" title="You shall therefore sacrifice the passover to the LORD your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>), and (2) the strict <span class= "ital">unity</span> of the place of this festival (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-5.htm" title="You may not sacrifice the passover within any of your gates, which the LORD your God gives you:">Deuteronomy 16:5</a>).

He carefully preserved the sepulchre of that man of God, who came from Judah to foretell the throwing down of Jeroboam's altar. When they had cleared the country of the old leaven of idolatry, then they applied themselves to the keeping of the feast. There was not holden such a passover in any of the foregoing reigns. The revival of a long-neglected ordinance, filled them with holy joy; and God recompensed their zeal in destroying idolatry with uncommon tokens of his presence and favour. We have reason to think that during the remainder of Josiah's reign, religion flourished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The details of the Passover are given by the author of Chronicles (the marginal reference).

Many of the Israelites who were at Jerusalem might have heard of, if they did not hear, the law read by Josiah. It is probable that they might even have procured a copy of the law, stimulated as they were to the better observance of Jehovah's worship by the unusual and solemn transactions at Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the Lord in Jerusalem.

The writer of the Kings has never mentioned the passover of Hezekiah, but it is noteworthy that the Chronicler, though he has given the account of Hezekiah’s feast, yet, equally with the compiler of this book, says that no such passover as Josiah’s had been held before since Samuel’s days. This shews clearly that his meaning was that no passover-feast had gone so strictly according to the book of the covenant.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah,</span> wherein <span class="cmt_word">this Passover was holden to the Lord in Jerusalem</span> (compare, on the date, <a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/35-19.htm">2 Chronicles 35:19</a>).
