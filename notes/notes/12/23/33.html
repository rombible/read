The LXX. here has “removed him,” but the other versions “bound him.”<p><span class= "bld">That he might not reign.</span>—This is the reading of the Hebrew margin, some MSS., and the LXX., Vulg., and Targum. The Syriac and Arabic have, “when he reigned,” which is the ordinary Hebrew text. The original text of the whole was perhaps this: “and Pharaoh-nechoh bound him at Riblah . . . and removed him from reigning in Jerusalem;” <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, he threw him into bonds, and pronounced his deposition. (Comp, the construction in <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1Kings 15:13</a>.) Riblah (now <span class= "ital">Ribleh</span>) lay in a strong position on the Orontes, commanding the caravan route from Palestine to the Euphrates. Necho had advanced so far, after the battle of Megiddo, and taken up his quarters there, as Nebuchadnezzar did afterwards (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm" title="So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.">2Kings 25:6</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/25-20.htm" title="And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:">2Kings 25:20-21</a>). Josephus relates that Necho summoned Jehoahaz to his camp at Riblah. The passage, <a href="/ezekiel/19-4.htm" title="The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 19:4</a>, suggests that he got the king of Judah into his power by fraud: “he was taken in their pit.” It used to be supposed, on the strength of Herod, ii. 159, that Necho captured <span class= "ital">Jerusalem</span>. What Herodotus says is this: “And engaging the Syrians on foot at Magdolus, Nechoh was victorious. After the battle he took Kadytis, a great city of Syria.” Kadytis has been thought to be either <span class= "ital">Hadath</span> (“the new town;” referring to the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Return), or <span class= "ital">el-Kuds</span>(“the holy;” the modern Arabic title of Jerusalem), or Gaza. In reality it is Kadesh on the Orontes, one of the great Hittite capitals, and not far from Hamath.<p><span class= "bld">A talent of gold.</span>—So Chronicles. The LXX. here reads, <span class= "ital">an hundred talents of gold</span> (a transcriber’s error). The Syriac and Arabic, <span class= "ital">ten talents</span>, which may be right. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear.

Daphne is put for Riblah; and Josephus (d) says Antioch was by Daphne of Syria; and in the Apocrypha:"Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.'' (2 Maccabees 4:33)Daphne is said to be by Antioch; with which place Pompey was greatly delighted, because of the pleasantness of it, and the abundance of waters about it (e): hither, it is probable, Jehoahaz went with an army to avenge his father's death on the king of Egypt, or to assist the king of Babylon, or both; and here Pharaoh met with him, and took him, and bound him; he seems to be of a martial spirit, from <a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a>. <p>that he might not reign in Jerusalem; whither afterwards the king of Egypt came, and took it; and so Herodotus (f) says that after he had conquered the Syrians at Migdol, he took Cadytis, a great city of Syria, which seems to be Jerusalem, the holy city: <p>and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold; the land of Judah; and one hundred talents, according to Bunting (g), amounted to 37,500 pounds of our money; and a talent of gold, according to Brerewood (h), was 4,500 pounds; but Bishop Cumberland (i) makes it 5,067 pounds, three shillings, and ten pence; a talent of gold could not be so large in Homer's time, since he speaks of seven of them given at once in a way of hospitality (k). <p>(c) Comment. in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47.htm">Ezekiel 47</a>.fol. 261.

We cannot, however, be sure that this implies an advance by Pharaoh-nechoh upon the holy city. However, the appointment which the people had made was clearly not acceptable to the Egyptian king, and Jehoahaz was carried away to the point which Pharaoh had reached in his march from Carchemish, and there put in bonds.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Riblah</span>] (called also <span class="ital">Riblathah</span>) was a city on the Orontes, and on the road which led from Palestine to Babylon.

It commanded a ford over the river (Condor, 'Heth and Moab,' p. 17), and is in the midst of a rich, corn-producing country. Hamath, to which it was regarded as belonging, is situated more than fifty miles further down the river. Riblah was well placed as a center for communication with the neighboring countries. As Dr. Robinson says ('Researches,' vol. 3. p. 545), "From this point the roads were open by Aleppo and the Euphrates to Nineveh, or by Palmyra (Tadmor) to Babylon, by the end of Lebanon and the coast to Palestine (Philistia) and Egypt, or through the, Buka'a and the Jordan valley to the center of the Holy Land." Nebuchadnezzar followed the example of Nechoh in making Ribiah his headquarters during his sieges of Tyro and Jerusalem (see <a href="/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Hamath.</span> The "land of Hamath" was the upper part of the Coele-Syrian valley from about lat. 34&deg; to lat. 35&deg; 30' N. <span class="cmt_word">That he might not reign in Jerusalem.</span> Nechoh might naturally distrust the people's choice. He might also regard the setting up of any king at Jerusalem without his sanction as an act of contumacy on the part of a nation which had been practically conquered by the complete defeat of Josiah at Megiddo. Whether his conduct in seizing Jehoahaz after inviting him to a conference was justifiable or not may be questioned; but, in point of fact, he did but use the right of the conqueror somewhat harshly. <span class="cmt_word">And put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</span> (So Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) The tribute was a very moderate one. A century earlier Sennacherib had enacted a tribute of three hundred talents of silver, <span class="accented">and thirty</span> of gold (see above, <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>).
