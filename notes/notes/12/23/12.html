It may have been erected on the flat roof of one of the gates, or on the top of a store-chamber. Altars upon roofs were a new form of idolatry, apparently connected with the worship of the "host of heaven" (see <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which the kings of Judah</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Manasseh and Amen, perhaps also Ahaz - <span class="cmt_word">had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord</span> (see above, <a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4, 5</a>).

Josiah ordered the ashes to be cast upon these graves, probably in order to defile them as the graves of idolaters.</body></html>
