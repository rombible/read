How Josiah could suffer all this, till the eighteenth year of his reign, is difficult to say; perhaps it was done without his knowledge. He now, however, gives orders that all these instruments of idolatry should be burned, in the fields adjoining to the brook Kidron; and that the ashes of them should be carried out of his kingdom to Beth-el: in token of his abhorrence of every species of idolatry, and to pollute and disgrace that place which had been the chief seat and throne of it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:4-14 What abundance of wickedness in Judah and Jerusalem!

The fate of Judah was fixed (vers. 26, 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order.</span> Not the "deputy-high priests," of whom there seems to have been only one at this period of the history (<a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>); nor the "heads of the courses," who were not recognized as a distinct class of priests till much later; but merely the common priests, as distinguished from the high priest. (So Keil, Bahr, and others.) <span class="cmt_word">And the keepers of the door</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the keepers of the threshold</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Levites, whose duty it was to keep watch and ward at the outer temple gates (see <a href="/1_chronicles/26-13.htm">1 Chronicles 26:13-18</a>). Their importance at this time appears again in <a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal.</span> The reformation naturally began with the purging of the temple. So the reformation under Jehoiada (<a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>) and that of Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-15.htm">2 Chronicles 33:15</a>). Under "the vessels" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) would be included the entire paraphernalia of worship, even the two altars which had been set up in honor of Baal in the outer and the inner courts (comp. <a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for the grove</span> (see <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and for all the host of heaven.</span> The three worships are here united, because there was a close connection between them. Baal was, in one of his aspects, the sun; and Astarte, the goddess of the "grove" wet-ship, was, in one of her aspects, the moon. The cult of "the host of heaven," though, perhaps, derived from a different source, naturally became associated with the cults of the sun and moon. <span class="cmt_word">And he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron.</span> The Law required that idols should be burnt with fire (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>), and likewise "groves" (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). It was enough to "overthrow" altars (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>) and to "break" pillars. But Josiah seems to have thought it best to destroy by fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the completest possible way, all the objects, of whatever kind, which had been connected with the idol-worship (see vers. 6, 12, 15, 16). The burning took place in "the fields of Kidron," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the upper part of the Kidron valley, to the northeast of Jerusalem, in order that not even the smoke should pollute the town (comp. <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.</span> This was a very unusual precaution, and shows Josiah's extreme scrupulousness. He would not have even the ashes of the wooden objects, or the calcined powder of the metal ones, remain even in the vicinity of the holy city, but transported them to a distance. In selecting Bethel as the place to convey them to, he was no doubt actuated by the circumstance that that village was in some sense the fount and origin of all the religious impurities which had overflowed the land. That which had proceeded from Bethel might well be taken back thither. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The reply of Huldah the prophetess. - Huldah confirmed the fear expressed by Josiah, that the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Jerusalem and its inhabitants on account of their idolatry, and proclaimed first of all (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-16.htm">2 Kings 22:16</a>, <a href="/2_kings/22-17.htm">2 Kings 22:17</a>), that the Lord would bring upon Jerusalem and its inhabitants all the punishments with which the rebellious and idolaters are threatened in the book of the law; and secondly (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18-20</a>), to the king himself, that on account of his sincere repentance and humiliation in the sight of God, he would not live to see the predicted calamities, but would be gathered to his fathers in peace. The first part of her announcement applies "to the man who has sent you to me" (<a href="/2_kings/22-15.htm">2 Kings 22:15</a>), the second "to the king of Judah, who has sent to inquire of the Lord" (<a href="/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18</a>). "The man" who had sent to her was indeed also the king; but Huldah intentionally made use of the general expression "the man," etc., to indicate that the word announced to him applied not merely to the king, but to every one who would hearken to the word, whereas the second portion of her reply had reference to the king alone. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-16.htm">2 Kings 22:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>, is Jerusalem as the capital of the kingdom. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-16.htm">2 Kings 22:16</a>, &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is an explanatory apposition to &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;. <a href="/2_kings/22-17.htm">2 Kings 22:17</a>. "With all the work of their hands," i.e., with the idols which they have made for themselves (cf. <a href="/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>). The last clause in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18</a>, "the words which thou hast heard," is not to be connected with the preceding one, "thus saith the Lord," and &#1506;&#1500; or &#1500; to be supplied; but it belongs to the following sentence, and is placed at the head absolutely: as for the words, which thou hast heart - because thy heart has become soft, i.e., in despair at the punishment with which the sinners are threatened (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-3.htm">Deuteronomy 20:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>), and thou hast humbled thyself, when thou didst hear, etc.; therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, etc. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, "that they (the city and inhabitants) may become a desolation and curse." These words, which are often used by the prophets, but which are not found connected like this except in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22</a>, rest upon <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, and show that these passages had been read to the king out of the book of the law. </body></html>
