Eliakim is “El setteth up;” Jehoiakim, “Jah setteth up.” Necho meant to signify that the new king was his creature. Eliakim, the elder son, may have paid court to Necho; or the Egyptian may have deposed Jehoahaz, as elected without his consent, and perhaps as likely to prove a stronger king than his brother. Necho may have fancied a resemblance between the name <span class= "ital">Yahû</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e., Jah;</span> so it was then pronounced) and <span class= "ital">Aah</span>, the name of the Egyptian moon-god.

The wicked perished in great numbers, the remnant were purified, and Josiah's reformation had raised up some to join the few who were the precious seed of their future church and nation. A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect.

It seems likely, from their purely Jewish character, that the new names of the Jewish kings, though formally imposed by the suzerain, were selected by the individuals themselves. The change now made consisted merely in the substitution of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; yehova&#770;h for &#1488;&#1500;  'e&#770;l ("God, Yahweh, will set up"). Both names alike refer to the promise which God made to David <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a> and imply a hope that, notwithstanding the threats of the prophets, the seed of David would still be allowed to remain upon the throne. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

Pharaoh-Nechoh, when he deposed Jehoahaz, at once supplied his place by another king. He had no intention of altering the governmental system of Palestine, or of ruling his conquests in any other way than through dependent monarchs. His choice fell on Josiah's eldest surviving son (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>), Eliakim, who was the natural successor of his father. Eliakim, on ascending the throne, changed his name, as Jehoahaz appears to have done (see the comment on ver. 31), and reigned as Jehoiakim. For three years (B.C. 608-605) he continued a submissive vassal of the Egyptian monarch, and remitted him his tribute regularly (ver. 36). But his rule was in all respects an evil one. He "did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 37). He leant towards idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-8.htm">2 Chronicles 36:8</a>); he was oppressive and irreligious (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:5. &sect; 2); he "shed innocent blood" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>); he was luxurious (<a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14, 15</a>), covetous (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>), and tyrannical (<a href="/ezekiel/19-6.htm">Ezekiel 19:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pharaoh-Nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father.</span> (On the general inclination of Oriental monarchs to support the hereditary principle, and to establish sons in their fathers' governments, even when the father's had been rebels or enemies, see Herod., 3:15.) <span class="cmt_word">And turned his name to Jehoiakim.</span> We may understand that Nechoh required him to take a new name, as a mark of subjection (comp. <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>; and also <a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>), but left the choice of the name to himself. He made the change as slight as possible, merely substituting "Jehovah" for "El" as the initial element. The sense of the name remained the same, "God will set up."
