Now those troubles were to come, not from Egypt, but from Babylon; and their commencement was not the invasion of Necho in 608 B.C., but that of Nebuchadnezzar three years later. Thus was Josiah "taken away from the evil to come," and died "in peace" before his city had suffered attack from the really formidable enemy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 23<p>2Ki 23:1-3. Josiah Causes the Law to Be Read.<p>1-3. the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders&#8212;This pious and patriotic king, not content with the promise of his own security, felt, after Huldah's response, an increased desire to avert the threatened calamities from his kingdom and people. Knowing the richness of the divine clemency and grace to the penitent, he convened the elders of the people, and placing himself at their head, accompanied by the collective body of the inhabitants, went in solemn procession to the temple, where he ordered the book of the law to be read to the assembled audience, and covenanted, with the unanimous concurrence of his subjects, to adhere steadfastly to all the commandments of the Lord. It was an occasion of solemn interest, closely connected with a great national crisis, and the beautiful example of piety in the highest quarter would exert a salutary influence over all classes of the people in animating their devotions and encouraging their return to the faith of their fathers.Josiah causeth the law to be read in a solemn assembly; reneweth the covenant of the Lord; destroyeth idolatry, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/23-1.htm" title="And the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem....">2 Kings 23:1-14</a></span>; breaketh down the altar at Beth-el, and burneth thereon dead men’s bones, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove....">2 Kings 23:15-20</a></span>; keepeth the passover: other evidences of his piety, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/23-21.htm" title="And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant....">2 Kings 23:21-25</a></span>.

The first part of her announcement applies "to the man who has sent you to me" (<a href="/2_kings/22-15.htm">2 Kings 22:15</a>), the second "to the king of Judah, who has sent to inquire of the Lord" (<a href="/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18</a>). "The man" who had sent to her was indeed also the king; but Huldah intentionally made use of the general expression "the man," etc., to indicate that the word announced to him applied not merely to the king, but to every one who would hearken to the word, whereas the second portion of her reply had reference to the king alone. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-16.htm">2 Kings 22:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>, is Jerusalem as the capital of the kingdom.

The last clause in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/22-18.htm">2 Kings 22:18</a>, "the words which thou hast heard," is not to be connected with the preceding one, "thus saith the Lord," and &#1506;&#1500; or &#1500; to be supplied; but it belongs to the following sentence, and is placed at the head absolutely: as for the words, which thou hast heart - because thy heart has become soft, i.e., in despair at the punishment with which the sinners are threatened (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-3.htm">Deuteronomy 20:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>), and thou hast humbled thyself, when thou didst hear, etc.; therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, etc. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, "that they (the city and inhabitants) may become a desolation and curse." These words, which are often used by the prophets, but which are not found connected like this except in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22</a>, rest upon <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, and show that these passages had been read to the king out of the book of the law. </body></html>
