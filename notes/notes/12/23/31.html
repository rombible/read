A little time, and slender abilities, often suffice to undo the good which pious men have, for a course of years, been labouring to effect.

Pharaoh-Nechoh, having defeated Josiah, left Jerusalem and Judaea behind him, while he pressed forward on his original enterprise (see ver. 29) into Northern Syria and the district about Carehemish, or the tract north-east of Aleppo. It was three months before he had completed his conquests in these quarters, and, having arranged matters to his satisfaction, set out on his return to Egypt. During these three months Jehoahaz bore rule at Jerusalem (ver. 31), and "did evil in the sight of the Lord" (ver. 32). Ezekiel compares him to "a young lion," which "learned to catch the prey, and devoured men" (Ezekiel 19:3). It may be suspected that he re-established the idolatries which Josiah had put down; but this is uncertain. Pharaoh-Nechoh, on his return from Carehemish, learning what the Jews had done, sent envoys to Jerusalem, and summoned Jehoahaz to his presence at Riblah, in the territory of Hamath (ver. 33; comp. Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 2). Je-hoahaz obeyed the summons; and Nechoh, having obtained possession of his person, "put him in bands," and carried him off to Egypt, where he died (ver. 34; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>; Josephus, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign.</span> He was, therefore, younger than his brother Eliakim, who, three months later, was "twenty-five years old" (ver. 36). His original name seems to have been "Shallum," as above noticed (see the comment on ver. 30). Probably he changed it to "Jehoahaz" ("Possession of Jehovah") on his accession. <span class="cmt_word">And he reigned three months in Jerusalem</span> - three months <span class="accented">and tern days</span>, according to Josephus - <span class="cmt_word">and his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span> The father of Hamutal was not, therefore, Jeremiah the prophet, who was a native of Anathoth (see <a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Conclusion of Josiah's reign. - <a href="/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>. As Josiah had the passover kept in perfect accordance with the precepts of the law, so did he also exterminate the necromancers, the teraphim and all the abominations of idolatry, throughout all Judah and Jerusalem, to set up the words of the law in the book of the law that had been found, i.e., to carry them out and bring them into force.

See the remarks on this point at <a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>. He turned to Jehovah with all his heart, etc.: there is an evident allusion here to <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>. Compare with this the sentence of the prophet Jeremiah concerning his reign (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15-16</a>).</body></html>
