He had no love for the temple, made no conscience of his duty to God, nor had any regard to his law, and therefore was a reproach to that honourable name and family, to which he was under such great obligations, and which, of consequence, was really a reproach to him, showing his wickedness in a more aggravated point of view.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 Few and evil were the days of Ahaz.

Into this league they were anxious that Judaea should enter; but they distrusted the house of David, which had been so long hostile both to Damascus and to Samaria. They consequently formed the design of transferring the Jewish crown to a certain Ben-Tabeal <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>, probably a Jewish noble, perhaps a refugee at one of their courts, whom they could trust to join heartily in their schemes (<a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>2Ki 16:1-16.

Ahaz &#8230; did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord&#8212;[See on [345]2Ch 28:1.] The character of this king's reign, the voluptuousness and religious degeneracy of all classes of the people, are graphically portrayed in the writings of Isaiah, who prophesied at that period. The great increase of worldly wealth and luxury in the reigns of Azariah and Jotham had introduced a host of corruptions, which, during his reign, and by the influence of Ahaz, bore fruit in the idolatrous practices of every kind which prevailed in all parts of the kingdom (see 2Ch 28:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign:</span> of the difficulty hence arising, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/2_kings/18-2.htm" title="Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.

"In the second year of Pekah Jotham began to reign." This agrees with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27</a>, that Pekah became king in the last year of Uzziah, supposing that it occurred at the commencement of the year. Jotham's sixteen years therefore came to a close in the seventeenth year of Pekah's reign (<a href="/2_kings/16-1.htm">2 Kings 16:1</a>). His reign was like that of his father Uzziah (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>, <a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-3.htm">2 Kings 15:3</a>, <a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>), except, as is added in Chr. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>, that he did not force himself into the temple of the Lord, as Uzziah had done (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). All that is mentioned of his enterprises in the account before us is that he built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, that is to say, that he restored it, or perhaps added to its beauty. The upper gate, according to <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a> compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-3.htm">2 Kings 8:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-5.htm">2 Kings 8:5</a>,<a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>, is the gate at the north side of the inner or upper court, where all the sacrifices were slaughtered, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38-43</a>. We also find from <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>. that he built against the wall of Ophel, and several cities in the mountains of Judah, and castles and towers in the forests, and subdued the Ammonites, so that they paid him tribute for three years. Jotham carried on with great vigour, therefore, the work which his father had began, to increase the material prosperity of his subjects. </body></html>
