Naturally, Damascus was the first object of attack. It was the head of the confederacy, and it lay nearest to an army descending upon Lower Syria, as all Asiatic armies would descend, from the north. It appears from an inscription of Tiglath-pileser's, that Rezin met him in the field, was defeated, and slain. An attack upon Pekah followed. Now probably it was that the entire trans-Jordanic region was overrun: and that the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, were carried into captivity <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>. Megiddo and Dor appear also to have been occupied, and the Arabs of the south chastised. Tiglathpileser then returned to Damascus, where a son of Rezin had assumed the crown; he besieged and took the city, and punished Rezin's son with death. Tiglath-pileser appears by one of his inscriptions to have held a court at Damascus, to which it is probable that the tributary kings of the neighborhood were summoned to pay their tributes and do homage for their kingdoms. Among the tributes brought to him at this time, those of Judaea, Edom, Ammon, Moab, Gaza, Ascalon, and Tyre, are mentioned.<p>Kir - Kir is mentioned by Amos Amo 9:7 as the country from which the Syrians came. It is joined by Isaiah Isa 22:6 with Elam or Elymais. Its position can only be conjectured. Perhaps the word designates a region adjoining Elymais, in the extreme southeastern limits of Assyria. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9. So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser&#8212;In spite of the assurance given him by Isaiah by two signs, the one immediate, the other remote (Isa 7:14; 8:4), that the confederate kings would not prevail against him, Ahaz sought aid from the Assyrian monarch, to purchase which he sent the treasures of the palace and temple. Tiglath-pileser marched against Damascus, slew Rezin the king, and carried the people of Damascus into captivity to Kir, which is thought to have been the city Karine (now Kerend), in Media.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Against Damascus, </span> the metropolis of the Syrians, and the head of that kingdom, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm" title="For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.">Isaiah 7:8</a></span>; as was prophesied, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/amos/1-5.htm" title="I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.">Amos 1:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Kir; </span> not Kir of Moab, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm" title="The burden of Moab.

Hence, as we see immediately, Tiglath-pileser appears to have stayed some time in Damascus.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria hearkened unto him.</span> Overtures of the kind were almost certain to be accepted. The great conquering monarchs of the East were always glad to receive small states into their alliance for a time, and even to allow them a shadow of independence, while they made use of their services against their near neighbors. Tiglath-pileser was already bent on conquering Samaria and Damascus, and could not fail to perceive that their subjugation would be greatly facilitated by his having the support of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">For the King of Assyria</span>  - rather, <span class="accented">and the King of Assyria - went</span> up against Damascus. Damascus was naturally attacked first, as nearer to Assyria than Samaria, and also as more wealthy and more important. Tiglath-pileser's records contain an account of the campaign, but it is unfortunately much mutilated. We may gather from it, however, that Resin began by meeting his assailant in the field, and engaging him in a battle which was stoutly contested. Eventually the Assyrians were victorious, and Resin, having fled hastily to Damascus, shut himself up within its walls. Tiglath-pileser pursued him, laid siege to the city, and eventually took it, though not perhaps till it had resisted for above a year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 65). The Assyrian monarch thus describes the siege (ibid., p. 121): "Damascus, his city, I besieged, and like a caged bird I enclosed him. His forests, the trees of which were without number, I cut down; I did not leave a tree standing. [I burnt] Hadara, the house of the father of Rezin, King of Syria." <span class="cmt_word">And took it.</span> The ancient Damascene kingdom, which had lasted from the time of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), was thus brought to an end. Damascus gave the Assyrians no further trouble; and within little more than thirty years it had been so absolutely absorbed into the empire that its governor was one of the Assyrian eponyms ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68). The capture of the city, foretold by <a href="/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4, 5</a>, was followed by the destruction of its walls and palaces. <span class="cmt_word">And carried the people of it captive.</span> The system of transplanting large masses of the population from one part of the empire to another seems to have begun with Tiglath-pileser. In his very imperfect and fragmentary annals we find the removal of above thirty thousand captives recorded, of whom more than half are women. His example was followed by his successors on a still larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">To Kir</span>. The situation of "Kir" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) is wholly uncertain. It has been identified with Kis (Elam or Kissia); with the country watered by the Kur; with Kourena or Koura, on the river Mardus; with Karine, the modern Kirrind; with Kirkhi near Diartekr; and with Kiransi in the Urumiyeh country. But the similarity of sound is the sole basis for each and all of these identifications. It is best to confess our ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">And slew Rezin.</span> This is perhaps implied, but it is not distinctly stated, in the extant annals of Tiglath-pileser. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Ahaz walked in the way of the kings of Israel," to which there is added by way of explanation in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>, "and also made molten images to the Baals." This refers, primarily, simply to the worship of Jehovah under the image of a calf, which they had invented; for this was the way in which all the kings of Israel walked. At the same time, in <a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a> the same formula is so used of Joram king of Judah as to include the worship of Baal by the dynasty of Ahab. Consequently in the verse before us also the way of the kings of Israel includes the worship of Baal, which is especially mentioned in the Chronicles. - "He even made his son pass through the fire," i.e., offered him in sacrifice to Moloch in the valley of Benhinnom (see at <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), after the abominations of the nations, whom Jehovah had cast out before Israel. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493; we have the plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>, and in <a href="/2_chronicles/28-16.htm">2 Chronicles 28:16</a> &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;, kings of Asshur, instead of &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, although only one, viz., Tiglath-pileser, is spoken of. This repeated use of the plural shows very plainly that it is to be understood rhetorically, as expressing the thought in the most general manner, since the number was of less importance than the fact.<p>(Note: The Greeks and Romans also use the plural instead of the singular in their rhetorical style of writing, especially when a father, a mother, or a son is spoken of. Cf. Cic. de prov. cons. xiv. 35: si ad jucundissimos liberos, si ad clarissimum generum redire properaret, where Julia, the only daughter of Caesar, and the wife of Pompey the Great, is referred to; and for other examples see Caspari, der Syr. Ephraimit. Krieg, p. 41.)<p>So far as the fact is concerned, we have here the first instance of an actual Moloch-sacrifice among the Israelites, i.e., of one performed by slaying and burning. For although the phrase &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; or &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; does not in itself denote the slaying and burning of the children as Moloch-sacrifices, but primarily affirms nothing more than the simple passing through fire, a kind of februation or baptism of fire (see at <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>); such passages as <a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, where sacrificing in the valley of Benhinnom is called slaying and burning the children, show most distinctly that in the verse before us &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is to be taken as signifying actual sacrificing, i.e., the burning of the children slain in sacrifice to Moloch, and, as the emphatic &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; indicates, that this kind of idolatrous worship, which had never been heard of before in Judah and Israel, was introduced by Ahaz.<p>(Note: "If this idolatry had occurred among the Israelites before the time of Ahaz, its abominations would certainly not have been passed over by the biblical writers, who so frequently mention other forms of idolatry." These are the correct words of Movers (Phniz. i. p. 65), who only errs in the fact that on the one hand he supposes the origin of human sacrifices in the time of Ahaz to have been inwardly connected with the appearance of the Assyrians, and traces them to the acquaintance of the Israelites with the Assyrian fire-deities Adrammelech and Anammelech (<a href="/2_kings/17-31.htm">2 Kings 17:31</a>), and on the other hand gives this explanation of the phrase, "cause to pass through the fire for Moloch," which is used to denote the sacrificing of children: "the burning of children was regarded as a passage, whereby, after the separation of the impure and earthly dross of the body, the children attained to union with the deity" (p. 329). To this J. G. Mller has correctly replied (in Herzog's Cyclop.): "This mystic, pantheistic, moralizing view of human sacrifices is not the ancient and original view of genuine heathenism. It is no more the view of Hither Asia than the Mexican view (i.e., the one which lay at the foundation of the custom of the ancient Mexicans, of passing the new-born boy four times through the fire). The Phoenician myths, which Movers (p. 329) quotes in support of his view, refer to the offering of human sacrifices in worship, and the moral view is a later addition belonging to Hellenism. The sacrifices were rather given to the gods as food, as is evident from innumerable passages (compare the primitive religions of America), and they have no moral aim, but are intended to reward or bribe the gods with costly presents, either because of calamities that have already passed, or because of those that are anticipated with alarm; and, as Movers himself admits (p. 301), to make atonement for ceremonial sins, i.e., to follow smaller sacrifices by those of greater value.")<p>In the Chronicles, therefore &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is correctly explained by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1512;, "he burned;" though we cannot infer from this that &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is always a mere conjecture for &#1492;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, as Geiger does (Urschrift u. Uebers, der Bibel, p. 305). The offering of his son for Moloch took place, in all probability, during the severe oppression of Ahaz by the Syrians, and was intended to appease the wrath of the gods, as was done by the king of the Moabites in similar circumstances (<a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>). - In <a href="/2_kings/16-4.htm">2 Kings 16:4</a> the idolatry is described in the standing formulae as sacrificing upon high places and hills, etc., as in <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. The temple-worship prescribed by the law could easily be continued along with this idolatry, since polytheism did not exclude the worship of Jehovah. It was not till the closing years of his reign that Ahaz went so far as to close the temple-hall, and thereby suspend the temple-worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24</a>); in any case it was not till after the alterations described in <a href="/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>. as having been made in the temple. </body></html>
