Into this league they were anxious that Judaea should enter; but they distrusted the house of David, which had been so long hostile both to Damascus and to Samaria. They consequently formed the design of transferring the Jewish crown to a certain Ben-Tabeal <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>, probably a Jewish noble, perhaps a refugee at one of their courts, whom they could trust to join heartily in their schemes (<a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>2Ki 16:1-16.

The great increase of worldly wealth and luxury in the reigns of Azariah and Jotham had introduced a host of corruptions, which, during his reign, and by the influence of Ahaz, bore fruit in the idolatrous practices of every kind which prevailed in all parts of the kingdom (see 2Ch 28:24).Ahaz’s idolatry, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/16-1.htm" title="In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign....">2 Kings 16:1-4</a></span>.

Reign of Ahaz, king of Judah. He reigns wickedly. Israel and Syria make war upon Jerusalem. Ahaz obtains assistance from Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-1.htm" title="Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:...">2 Chronicles 28:1-21</a>)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">In the seventeenth year of Pekah</span>] It is clear that some error has crept into the chronological statements of this period. In the previous chapter (<a href="/2_kings/15-30.htm" title="And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.">2 Kings 15:30</a>) we read that Pekah was murdered by Hoshea in the twentieth year of Jotham. From the present verse it seems that Ahaz began to reign, and so Jotham died, before Pekah’s death. In reference to Ahaz too the figures are not without some difficulty. He begins his reign at 20 years old and reigns 16 years. But his son Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-2.htm" title="Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.">2 Kings 18:2</a>) was twenty-five years old at his accession, and so must have been born when Ahaz was not more than eleven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With reference, however, to the death of Pekah in the reign of Jotham, we see from <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.">Isaiah 7:1</a>, that Pekah was still alive and conducting operations against Judah in the reign of Ahaz. This agrees entirely with verse 5 of the present chapter. Therefore in any chronological calculation the words of <a href="/2_kings/15-30.htm" title="And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.">2 Kings 15:30</a> ought to be neglected. It is not easy to explain how the error arose, but it is manifest that there is an error.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham King of Judah began to reign.</span> (For the chronological difficulties connected with this statement, see the comment on 2 Kings 15:27.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jotham of Judah (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-1.htm">2 Chronicles 27:1-9</a>). - <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32</a>. "In the second year of Pekah Jotham began to reign." This agrees with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27</a>, that Pekah became king in the last year of Uzziah, supposing that it occurred at the commencement of the year. Jotham's sixteen years therefore came to a close in the seventeenth year of Pekah's reign (<a href="/2_kings/16-1.htm">2 Kings 16:1</a>). His reign was like that of his father Uzziah (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>, <a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-3.htm">2 Kings 15:3</a>, <a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>), except, as is added in Chr. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>, that he did not force himself into the temple of the Lord, as Uzziah had done (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). All that is mentioned of his enterprises in the account before us is that he built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, that is to say, that he restored it, or perhaps added to its beauty. The upper gate, according to <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a> compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-3.htm">2 Kings 8:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-5.htm">2 Kings 8:5</a>,<a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>, is the gate at the north side of the inner or upper court, where all the sacrifices were slaughtered, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38-43</a>. We also find from <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>. that he built against the wall of Ophel, and several cities in the mountains of Judah, and castles and towers in the forests, and subdued the Ammonites, so that they paid him tribute for three years. Jotham carried on with great vigour, therefore, the work which his father had began, to increase the material prosperity of his subjects. </body></html>
