The writer terminates his account of the reign of Ahaz with his usual formulae, which in this instance are wholly colorless. Ahaz's acts were written in the book of the chronicles of the kings; he died, and was buried with his fathers; Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his stead. This is all that he thinks it needful to say. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> The writer of Chronicles adds some important facts not found in the narrative of Kings. Among them are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The complete defeat of Ahaz by Pekah, who "smote him with a great slaughter" (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5</a>), killing a hundred and twenty thousand of his soldiers, and carrying Off two hundred thousand captives, men, women, and children (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-8.htm">2 Chronicles 28:8</a>); these captives were, however, afterwards restored (ver. 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> His defeat by the Syrians (ver. 5). This is, perhaps, implied in <a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>; but it is not expressly stated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> His defeat by the Edomites, who invaded his land, and made a largo number of prisoners (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The conquest in his reign of a considerable portion of Southern Judaea by the Philistines (ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The fact that Ahaz at one time in his life adopted the Syrian worship, and "sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which smote him" (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The fact that in his latter years he shut up the temple (ver. 24), closing the doors of the porch (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>), extinguishing the lamps (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>), and putting an end to the burning of incense and the offering of sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The fact that, not content with the previously existing high places, he set up a number of new ones, so that there should be a "high place" in every several city (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-25.htm">2 Chronicles 28:25</a>). The religious condition of Judaea can scarcely have been worse in the worst time of Manasseh or Amon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ahaz paid Tiglath-pileser a visit in Damascus, "to present to him his thanks and congratulations, and possibly also to prevent a visit from Tiglath-pileser to himself, which would not have been very welcome" (Thenius). The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; is neither to be altered into &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511; nor regarded as a copyist's error for &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, as we have several words in this chapter that are formed with dull Syriac u-sound. The visit of Ahaz to Damascus is simply mentioned on account of what follows, namely, that Ahaz saw an altar there, which pleased him so much that he sent a picture and model of it "according to all the workmanship thereof," i.e., its style of architecture, to Urijah the priest (see <a href="/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and had an altar made like it for the temple, upon which, on his return to Jerusalem, he ordered all the burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and drink-offerings to be presented. The allusion here is to the offerings which he commanded to be presented for his prosperous return to Jerusalem. </body></html>
