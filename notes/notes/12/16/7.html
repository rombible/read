So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser&#8212;In spite of the assurance given him by Isaiah by two signs, the one immediate, the other remote (Isa 7:14; 8:4), that the confederate kings would not prevail against him, Ahaz sought aid from the Assyrian monarch, to purchase which he sent the treasures of the palace and temple. Tiglath-pileser marched against Damascus, slew Rezin the king, and carried the people of Damascus into captivity to Kir, which is thought to have been the city Karine (now Kerend), in Media.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I am thy servant and thy son; </span> I yield myself to thee, as thy vassal, to serve and obey thee, and pay thee tribute, upon condition thou dost assist me against my enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel; </span> for though they were now gone from Jerusalem, yet he justly concluded they would return again, and from time to time molest and vex him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,....

(<a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-17.htm" title="For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives....">2 Chronicles 28:17-18</a>) it was not only by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Israel that Ahaz was straitened when he sent for help to Assyria. ‘The Edomites had again come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low countries, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh and Ajalon with Gederoth, and Socho with the villages thereof, and Timnah likewise and Gimzo, and they dwelt there.’ So that on north and south alike Ahaz was sorely beset. ‘For the Lord brought Judah low, because of Ahaz, for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am thy servant and thy son</span>] Ahaz, in return for the help he seeks, offers to make himself the vassal of Assyria. With the name ‘son’, as used in such an address, may be compared the ‘brother’ which Ahab uses of the conquered Benhadad (<a href="/1_kings/20-32.htm" title="So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Benhadad said, I pray you, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.">1 Kings 20:32</a>). Ahaz in his petition naturally only mentions those enemies on the north upon whom Tiglath-pileser could most readily fall. Perhaps he felt that, if relieved from them, he could dispose of the Edomites and Philistines by his own power.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> <span class="accented">- Expedition of Tiglath-pileser against Pekah and Rezin</span>. In the extremity of his danger, when the confederacy had declared itself, or perhaps later, when he had suffered terrible defeats, and was about. to be besieged in his capital (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5, 6</a>), Ahaz invoked the aid of Tiglath-pileser, sent him all the treasure on which he could lay his hands (ver. 8), offered to place himself and his kingdom under the Assyrian monarch's suzerainty, and entreated him to come and "save him out of the hands" of his enemies (ver. 7). Humanly speaking, he might be justified. He had not called in one foreign power until Pekah had called in another. There was no other prospect (again humanly speaking) of escape. But, had he accepted the offers of <a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4-16</a>, and relied wholly on Jehovah, his position would have been far better. However, he was unable to see this; he made his application; and Tiglath-pileser "came up," and utterly crushed the Syro-Israelite confederacy  (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria, saying.</span> This appeal to man rather than to God, this trust in "an arm of flesh," was exactly what Isaiah had been endeavoring to prevent, what he viewed as unfaithfulness, and as inevitably drawing down God's wrath both upon king and kingdom. Ahaz was young, was weak, and had no doubt a large body of advisers, who considered the prophet to be a fanatic, who had no belief in supernatural aid, and who thought that in any emergency recourse was to be had to the measures which human prudence and human policy dictated. The aid of Tiglath-pileser seemed to them, under the circumstances, the only thing that could save them; and they persuaded the weak prince to adopt their views. <span class="cmt_word">I am thy servant and thy son.</span> The offer of submission was unmistakable. "Servant," in the language of the time, meant "slave." Complete subjection, enrollment among Assyria's feudatories, the entire loss of independence, was well understood to be the price that had to be paid for Assyria's protection. Ahaz and his worldly advisers were prepared to pay it. They surrendered themselves, body and soul, into the hands of the great world-power of the period. <span class="cmt_word">Come up, and save me out of the hand of the King of Syria, and out of the hand of the King of Israel, which rise up against me.</span> Syria is put forward as at once the more formidable of the two foes, and the one most open to Assyrian attack. Already Damascus had been more than once menaced by Assyrian armies ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 113, 115, 116), while the kingdom of Samaria had only suffered at her extremities (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). Samaria could not well be approached excepting through Syria, and after Syria's downfall. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the time mentioned, "in the seventeenth year of Pekah Ahaz became king" see at <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32</a>. The datum "twenty years old" is a striking one, even if we compare with it <a href="/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>. As Ahaz reigned only sixteen years, and at his death his son Hezekiah became king at the age of twenty-five years (<a href="/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), Ahaz must have begotten him in the eleventh year of his age. It is true that in southern lands this is neither impossible nor unknown,<p>(Note: In the East they marry girls of nine or ten years of age to boys of twelve or thirteen (Volney, Reise, ii. p. 360). Among the Indians husbands of ten years of age and wives of eight are mentioned (Thevenot, Reisen, iii. pp. 100 and 165). In Abyssinia boys of twelve and even ten years old marry (Rppell, Abessynien, ii. p. 59). Among the Jews in Tiberias, mothers of eleven years of age and fathers of thirteen are not uncommon (Burckh. Syrien, p. 570); and Lynch saw a wife there, who to all appearance was a mere child about ten years of age, who had been married two years already. In the epist. ad N. Carbonelli, from Hieronymi epist. ad Vitalem, 132, and in an ancient glossa, Bochart has also cited examples of one boy of ten years and another of nine, qui nutricem suam gravidavit, together with several other cases of a similar kind from later writers. Cf. Bocharti Opp. i.((Geogr. sacr.) p. 920, ed. Lugd. 1692.)<p>but in the case of the kings of Judah it would be without analogy. The reading found in the lxx, Syr., and Arab. at <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-1.htm">2 Chronicles 28:1</a>, and also in certain codd., viz., five and twenty instead of twenty, may therefore be a preferable one. According to this, Hezekiah, like Ahaz, was born in his father's sixteenth year.</body></html>
