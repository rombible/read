And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser&#8212;This was a visit of respect, and perhaps of gratitude. During his stay in that heathen city, Ahaz saw an altar with which he was greatly captivated. Forthwith a sketch of it was transmitted to Jerusalem, with orders to Urijah the priest to get one constructed according to the Damascus model, and let this new altar supersede the old one in the temple. Urijah, with culpable complaisance, acted according to his instructions (2Ki 16:16). The sin in this affair consisted in meddling with, and improving according to human taste and fancy, the altars of the temple, the patterns of which had been furnished by divine authority (Ex 25:40; 26:30; 27:1; 1Ch 28:19). Urijah was one of the witnesses taken by Isaiah to bear his prediction against Syria and Israel (Isa 8:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Upon the great altar, </span> i.e. this new altar; which was greater than Solomon’s, either in quantity, or in his estimation.

We know nothing of its dimensions but we need not refer the adjective ‘great’ to the size of the structure. The king calls it so, because he means it to be the ‘principal’ altar. The same adjective is used for the ‘eldest’ among sons, and for the ‘chief’ among priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For an account of the burnt offering, which was accompanied also by a meal offering and a drink offering, see <a href="/context/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually....">Exodus 29:38-42</a>. These burnt offerings were offered, according to the original ordinance, every morning and every evening, and double as much on the Sabbath (<a href="/context/numbers/28-9.htm" title="And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:...">Numbers 28:9-10</a>).

The word is the same as in the previous clause, and in that which follows immediately.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the blood of the sacrifice</span>] The change made in the previous note was most needful, because here we have a different word, and one which is always rendered ‘sacrifice’. The distinction between ‘burnt offering’ and ‘sacrifice’, of both which all the blood is commanded to be sprinkled on the new altar, is that in the former the whole animal was consumed in the fire, whereas in ‘sacrifices’, e.g. of peace offerings, only some portion of the victim was burnt, and the other parts eaten by the offerers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">but</span>] <span class="ital">the brasen altar shall be for me to inquire</span> by] No doubt the verb here used is found in the sense of ‘to inquire’ after God and God’s will, as in <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm" title="One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.">Psalm 27:4</a> ‘to inquire in His temple’, though in that verse some render ‘to consider’ ‘to look with pleasure upon’. But Ahaz was not minded to do any such thing. He was casting away Jehovah’s worship as fully and as fast as he could. It seems better therefore to render these words ‘but as regards the brasen altar it shall be for me to inquire’, i.e. I will see later on what shall be done with it. The Vulgate renders ‘<span class="ital">paratum erit ad voluntatem meam</span>’, i.e. it shall be used as I hereafter decide. So the verb is found in <a href="/proverbs/20-25.htm" title="It is a snare to the man who devours that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.">Proverbs 20:25</a>, ‘It is a snare … after vows to make inquiry’, i.e. to deliberate and consider whether they shall be paid or not.

As, by the king's directions, all the regular and all the occasional sacrifices were to be offered upon his new altar, the other would practically be superfluous. It would have been only logical to remove it, or break it up; but this the king was probably afraid of doing.
