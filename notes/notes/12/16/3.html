Ahaz appears to have been the first Israelite king who offered such a sacrifice. He, no doubt, regarded it as a last desperate resource against the oppression of his northern enemies. It is absurd to suppose that the king intended it in love to his child, as Thenius suggests.

Whoever read that the kingdom of Israel was seasoned with the vicinity of the true religion of Judah? Goodness, such as our nature is, is not so apt to spread. A tainted air doth more easily affect a sound body, than a wholesome air can clear the sick’. (Bp. Hall.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yea, and made his son to pass through the fire</span>] i.e. To Moloch. Thus introducing into Judah once more, as in Solomon’s days (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>) the worship of ‘the abomination of the children of Ammon’. The words of this verse might be made to refer only to a passing through flame, as a ceremony significant of purification. But the words of the Chronicler are stronger: ‘he burnt his children in the fire.’ From which it would appear that not one son only was offered. That the children offered in such sacrifices were actually burnt is seen from <a href="/2_kings/17-31.htm" title="And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.">2 Kings 17:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm" title="That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?">Ezekiel 16:21</a>; and many other passages. But from the words of Ezekiel it may perhaps be inferred that the victims were first slain and then burnt. ‘Thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured … thou hast slain my children and delivered them up in causing them to pass through the fire unto them.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the abominations of the heathen</span>] The word ‘abomination’ is constantly employed of idols and their worship, their rites being often of the foulest character.

As the writer of Chronicles says (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>), "He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, <span class="accented">and made also molten images for Baalim</span>." <span class="accented">Baalim</span> is either a plural of dignity, or a word denoting the different forms under which Baal was worshipped, as Melkarth, Adonis, Rimmon, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and made his son to pass through the fire.</span> In Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>) we are told that "he burnt incense in the valley of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire," as if he had sacrificed more than one son. The practice of offering children in sacrifice was not a feature of the Assyro-Babylonian religion, as some suppose, but an intrinsic part of the worship of the Phoenicians, common to them with the Moabites, Ammonites, and others. It was based upon the principle of a man's offering to God that which was dearest and most precious to himself, whence the crowning sacrifice of the kind was a man's offering of his firstborn son (see <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). Some have supposed that the rite was a mere dedication or lustration, the children passing between two fires, and being thenceforward employed only in God's service. But the expressions used by the sacred writer and others, and still more the descriptions that have come down to us from heathen and patristic authors, make it absolutely certain that the "passing through the fire' was no such innocent ceremony as this, but involved the death of the children. The author of Chronicles says, "Ahaz <span class="accented">burnt</span> his children in the fire;" <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>, "They have built also the high places of Baal, <span class="accented">to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings</span> unto Baal;" <a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>, "Thou hast <span class="accented">slain</span> my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire." Josephus declares of Ahaz that he "made his own son a whole burnt offering (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>)." Diodorus Sicalus describes the ceremony as it took place at Carthage, the Phoenician colony. There was in the great temple there, he says, an image of Saturn (Moloch), which was a human figure with a bull's head and outstretched arms. This image of metal was made glowing hot by a fire kindled within it; and the children, laid in its arms, rolled from thence into the fiery lap below. If the children cried, the parents stopped their noise by fondling and kissing them; for the victim ought not to weep, and the sound of complaint was drowned in the din of flutes and kettle-drums (Died. Sic., 20:14). "Mothers," says Plutarch ('De Superstitione,' &sect; 13), "stood by without tears or sobs; if they wept or sobbed, they lost the honor of the act, and the children were sacrificed notwithstanding." The only doubtful point is whether the children were placed alive in the glowing arms of the image, or whether they were first killed and afterwards burnt in sacrifice; but the description of Diodorus seems to imply the more cruel of the two proceedings. <span class="cmt_word">According to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord east out from before the children of Israel.</span> (On the practice of this terrible rite by the Canaanitish nations at the time of the Israelite invasion, see <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9, 10</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37, 38</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jotham of Judah (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-1.htm">2 Chronicles 27:1-9</a>). - <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32</a>.

Jotham's sixteen years therefore came to a close in the seventeenth year of Pekah's reign (<a href="/2_kings/16-1.htm">2 Kings 16:1</a>).

Jotham carried on with great vigour, therefore, the work which his father had began, to increase the material prosperity of his subjects. </body></html>
