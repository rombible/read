It denotes not so much blindness as a dazing effect, accompanied by mental bewilderment and confusion. “They saw, but knew not what they saw” (<span class= "ital">Rashi</span>). Ewald pronounces the passage in Genesis the model of the present one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm" title="And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray you, with blindness.

We have a similar case <a href="/genesis/19-11.htm" title="And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.">Genesis 19:11</a>. Thus it happens to several men in their liquor, that though their eyes are open, and they can perceive the several objects which surround them, yet they cannot discern wherein they differ. And if we may suppose that the Syrian army was under the same <span class="greekheb">αορασια</span>, as the Greeks happily term such a degree of blindness or want of distinct vision, we need no more wonder that they readily accepted a guide who offered his service, than that a drunkard, after having lost his way, and found himself bewildered, should be thankful to any hand which should undertake to conduct him safe home — Houbigant and Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:13-23 What Elisha said to his servant is spoken to all the faithful servants of God, when without are fightings, and within are fears. Fear not, with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. The Syrians saw it was to no purpose to try to assault so great and so good a man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They came down to him - The Syrians, who had been encamped on rising ground opposite the hill of Dothan, now descended and drew near to the city.<p>The blindness with which they were smitten was not real - blindness actual loss of sight - but a state of illusion in which a man sees things otherwise than as they are (compare <a href="/2_kings/6-20.htm">2 Kings 6:20</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 6:18-23.

After this the Syrians followed them, and on their approach Elisha prayed that they might be smitten with blindness. Some have however thought that ‘to him’ is an error for ‘to them’, and have referred the verb to Elisha and his servant. Thus the sense would be: ‘When Elisha and his servant came down to the enemy, as they were emboldened to do, then Elisha prayed &c.’ But there is no such great difficulty in understanding the existing text, as to warrant us in accepting a conjecture which seems only supported by one, the Syriac, version. It was quite in the character of Elisha to go forth with his now courageous servant, and the Syrians at first would let them pass out so far that they might be surrounded directly by the waiting troops.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness</span>] What seems to have been sent upon the men was an illusion which prevented them from seeing correctly what was before them. Josephus explains it as a mist (<span class="greekheb">ἀχλὺς</span>) whereby they were prevented from recognising Elisha. The word, which is plural in form, occurs only here and in <a href="/genesis/19-11.htm" title="And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.">Genesis 19:11</a>. It denotes the seeing of something unreal instead of the true image. Thus these men could go with Elisha to Samaria, not knowing to what place he was leading them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they came down to him.</span> Keil and others suppose this to mean that the Syrians "came down" to Elisha; hut, if they were in the plain that surrounds the hill whereon Dothan was built, as appears from ver. 15, they would have had to ascend in order to reach Elisha, not to descend. We must, therefore, with F. Meyer, Thenius, and Bahr, translate, "When they [Elisha and his servant] came down to them [the Syrians]" - either changing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, as Thenius does, or understanding <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> to refer to the "host" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>) of the Syrians. <span class="cmt_word">Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness.</span> Not literal blindness, or they could not have followed Elisha's lead, and marched a distance of twelve miles to Samaria; but a state of confusion and Bewilderment, in which" seeing they saw, but did not perceive" (compare the "blindness" of the men of Sodom, in <a href="/genesis/19-11.htm">Genesis 19:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then one of the servants answered, "No, my lord king," i.e., it is not we who disclose thy plans to the king of Israel, "but Elisha the prophet tells him what thou sayest in thy bed-chamber;" whereupon the king of Syria inquired where the prophet lived, and sent a powerful army to Dothan, with horses and chariots, to take him prisoner there. Dothan (see <a href="/genesis/37-17.htm">Genesis 37:17</a>), which according to the Onom. was twelve Roman miles to the north of Samaria, has been preserved under its old name in a Tell covered with ruins to the south-west of Jenin, on the caravan-road from Gilead to Egypt (see Rob. Bibl. Res. p. 158, and V. de Velde, Journey, i. pp. 273,274). </body></html>
