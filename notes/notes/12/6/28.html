Dost thou fare worse than thy neighbours? Truly, yes: she and one of her neighbours had made a barbarous agreement, that, all provisions failing, they should boil and eat her son first, and then her neighbour’s: hers was eaten, (who can think on it without horror?) and now her neighbour hid hers. This shocking story is a terrible effect of the divine vengeance, which Moses, about six hundred years before, had warned the Israelites would fall upon them in case of their apostacy from, and rebellion against, God; as the reader may see in the passages referred to in the margin. The same dreadful calamity befell them at two other times besides this; at the siege of Jerusalem, under Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm" title="Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom you have done this.

The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king had assumed that the cry of the woman was for food.

That they should be brought to such hardships and horrors as are here described had been foretold to Israel in early times (<a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm" title="And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.">Leviticus 26:29</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/28-53.htm" title="And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the narrow place, with which your enemies shall distress you:...">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>); cf. also Lament. <a href="/2_kings/2-20.htm" title="And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.

Such an appeal the king was bound to hear; and he therefore asks," What aileth thee?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "What is thy ground of complaint?" Then she tells her story. <span class="cmt_word">And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</span> Compare the prophecy in Deuteronomy, "The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil towards the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates" (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56, 57</a>). There is historical testimony that the prophecy was three times fulfilled; viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in Samaria on the present occasion; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in Jerusalem during the last siege by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in Jerusalem during the last siege by Titus (Josephus, 'Bell.

In modern sieges surrender is made before the population is driven to such straits. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elisha forbade king Joram to slay the enemy that he had brought to him, because he had not taken them prisoners in war, and recommended him to treat them hospitably and then let them return to their lord. The object of the miracle would have been frustrated if the Syrians had been slain. For the intention was to show the Syrians that they had to do with a prophet of the true God, against whom no human power could be of any avail, that they might learn to fear the almighty God. Even when regarded from a political point of view, the prophet's advice was more likely to ensure peace than the king's proposal, as the result of <a href="/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a> clearly shows. The Syrians did not venture any more to invade the land of Israel with flying parties, from fear of the obvious protection of Israel by its God; though this did not preclude a regular war, like that related in the following account.
