This is supported by the LXX., “<span class= "greekheb">ὅτι ἐκεῖ Συρία κέκρυπται</span>;” the Syriac and Arabic, “are lurking;” the Vulg., “in insidiis sunt;” and the Targum, “are hidden.” But the word (Heb.) is really an irregular participial formation from nahath, “to descend,” and the Authorised Version is therefore correct.

Elisha apprised King Jehoram of the secret purpose of the enemy; so, by adopting precautionary measures, he was always enabled to anticipate and defeat their attacks. The frequency of his disappointments having led the Syrian king to suspect some of his servants of carrying on a treacherous correspondence with the enemy, he was informed about Elisha, whose apprehension he forthwith determined to effect. This resolution was, of course, grounded on the belief that however great the knowledge of Elisha might be, if seized and kept a prisoner, he could no longer give information to the king of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel,....

In spite of the strong language used against Jehoram (<a href="/context/2_kings/3-13.htm" title="And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.

Elisha did not suffer his hostile feeling towards Jehoram personally (<a href="/2_kings/3-13.htm">2 Kings 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-8.htm">2 Kings 5:8</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>) to interfere with his patriotism.

As the common dwelling-place had become too small for them, they resolved, with Elisha's consent, to build a new house, and went, accompanied by the prophet, to the woody bank of the Jordan to fell the wood that was required for the building. The place where the common abode had become too small is not given, but most of the commentators suppose it to have been Gilgal, chiefly from the erroneous assumption that the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a> was in the Jordan valley to the east of Jericho. Thenius only cites in support of this the reference in &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (dwell with thee) to <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>; but this decides nothing, as the pupils of the prophets sat before Elisha, or gathered together around their master in a common home, not merely in Gilgal, but also in Bethel and Jericho. We might rather think of Jericho, since Bethel and Gilgal (Jiljilia) were so far distant from the Jordan, that there is very little probability that a removal of the meeting-place to the Jordan, such as is indicated by &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1504;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, would ever have been thought of from either of these localities. </body></html>
