He is mentioned on the monuments of Shalmaneser II., now in the British Museum, under the designation of <span class= "ital">Rammânu-hidri</span>, or idri. Now, as the Assyrians identified their god <span class= "ital">Rammûnu</span> (Rimmon) with the Syrian deity, <span class= "ital">Adad, Addu</span>, or <span class= "ital">Dadi</span>, this title might be equivalent to <span class= "ital">Adad-idri</span>, or <span class= "ital">Addu-idri</span>. Further, in three contract tablets in the reign of Nabonidus, Mr. Pinches has read the names <span class= "ital">Bin-Addu-natânu</span> and Bin-<span class= "ital">Addu-amara</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, “Bin-Addu gave,” and “Bin-Adāu commanded.” Bin (or, <span class= "ital">Tur</span>)-Addu, “son of Addu,” is clearly the name of a god, like abal Esarra, “son of Esarra,” in the name Tiglath Pileser; and is, in fact, the Assyrian equivalent of Ben-hadad. The Syrian king’s full name, therefore, would seem to have been Ben-hadad-idri, “The son of Hadad is my help” (Syriac adar, “to help”). (Comp. the name Hadad-ezer.) The Assyrians omitted the first element, the Hebrews the last.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_kings/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.">2 Kings 6:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">And it came to pass after this, </span>&c. — How long after we are not informed; but probably some years, when they had forgotten the kindnesses they had received in Samaria, which for a time, it appears, had quite disarmed them of their hatred against Israel, and caused them to lay aside all thoughts of war.

The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After this - Perhaps some years after - when the miracle and the kind treatment were alike forgotten. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 6:24-33.

H. Mich., Budd., F. v. Meyer, and Thenius, who wants to alter &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; into &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, suppose, but must refer to the Syrians, who went down to the prophet, as is evident from what followed. For the assumption that the Syrians had stationed themselves below and round the mountain on which Dothan stood, and therefore would have had to come up to Elisha, need not occasion an unnatural interpretation of the words. It is true that Dothan stands upon an isolated hill in the midst of the plain; but on the eastern side it is enclosed by a ranger of hills, which project into the plain (see V. de Velde, R. i. p. 273). The Syrians who had been sent against Elisha had posted themselves on this range of hills, and thence they came down towards the town of Dothan, which stood on the hill, whilst Elisha went out of the town to meet them. It is true that Elisha's going out is not expressly mentioned, but in <a href="/2_kings/6-19.htm">2 Kings 6:19</a> it is clearly presupposed. &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is mental blindness here, as in the similar case mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-11.htm">Genesis 19:11</a>, that is to say, a state of blindness in which, though a man has eyes that can see, he does not see correctly. Elisha's untruthful statement, "this is not the way," etc., is to be judged in the same manner as every other ruse de guerre, by which the enemy is deceived. </body></html>
