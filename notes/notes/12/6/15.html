Fear not, with that fear which has torment and amazement; for they that are with us, to protect us, are more than they that are against us, to destroy us. The eyes of his body were open, and with them he saw the danger. Lord, open the eyes of our faith, that with them we may see thy protecting hand. The clearer sight we have of the sovereignty and power of Heaven, the less we shall fear the troubles of earth. Satan, the god of this world, blinds men's eyes, and so deludes them unto their own ruin; but when God enlightens their eyes, they see themselves in the midst of their enemies, captives to Satan, and in danger of hell, though, before, they thought their condition good. When Elisha had the Syrians at his mercy, he made it appear that he was influenced by Divine goodness as well as Divine power. Let us not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

In a war which the Syrians carried on against the Israelitish king Joram (not Jehoahaz, as Ewald, Gesch. iii. p. 557, erroneously supposes), by sending flying parties into the land of Israel (cf. <a href="/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a>), Elisha repeatedly informed king Joram of the place where the Syrians had determined to encamp, and thereby frustrated the plans of the enemy. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;...&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;: "at the place of so and so shall my camp be." &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497; as in <a href="/1_samuel/21-3.htm">1 Samuel 21:3</a> (see at <a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, the encamping or the place of encampment (cf. Ewald, 161, a.), is quite appropriate, so that there is no need either for the alteration into &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, "ye shall hide yourselves" (Then.), or into &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;, with the meaning which is arbitrarily postulated, "ye shall place an ambush" (Ewald, Gesch. iii. p. 558), or for the much simpler alteration into &#1500;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, "pitch the camp for me" (Bttcher). The singular suffix in &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497; refers to the king as leader of the war: "my camp"  equals  the camp of my army. "Beware of passing over (&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;) this place," i.e., of leaving it unoccupied, "for there have the Syrians determined to make their invasion." &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, going down, with dagesh euphon., whereas Ewald (187, b.) is of opinion that &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, instead of being an intrans. part. Kal, might rather be a part. Niph. of &#1495;&#1514;, which would not yield, however, any suitable meaning. Thenius renders &#1502;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, "to pass by this place," which would be grammatically admissible, but is connected with his conjecture concerning &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;, and irreconcilable with <a href="/2_kings/6-10.htm">2 Kings 6:10</a>. When the king of Israel, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/6-10.htm">2 Kings 6:10</a>, sent to the place indicated on account of Elisha's information, he can only have sent troops to occupy it; so that when the Syrians arrived they found Israelitish troops there, and were unable to attack the place. There is nothing in the text about the Syrians bursting forth from their ambush. &#1492;&#1494;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; means to enlighten, instruct, but not to warn. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "he took care there," i.e., he occupied the place with troops, to defend it against the Syrians, so that they were unable to do anything, "not once and not twice," i.e., several times. </body></html>
