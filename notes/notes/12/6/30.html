The language of Jehoram to the woman may be the language of despair. See the word of God fulfilled; among the threatenings of God's judgments upon Israel for their sins, this was one, that they should eat the flesh of their own children, De 28:53-57. The truth and the awful justice of God were displayed in this horrible transaction. Alas! what miseries sin has brought upon the world! But the foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord. The king swears the death of Elisha. Wicked men will blame any one as the cause of their troubles, rather than themselves, and will not leave their sins. If rending the clothes, without a broken and contrite heart, would avail, if wearing sackcloth, without being renewed in the spirit of their mind, would serve, they would not stand out against the Lord. May the whole word of God increase in us reverent fear and holy hope, that we may be stedfast and immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour is not in vain in the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sackcloth - Jehoram hoped perhaps to avert Yahweh's anger, as his father had done <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>.

It is more than doubtful, however, if he was truly humbled on account of his own and the nation's sins; otherwise he would not have vowed vengeance on the prophet's life. The true explanation seems to be, that Elisha having counselled him not to surrender, with the promise, on condition of deep humiliation, of being delivered, and he having assumed the signs of contrition without receiving the expected relief, regarded Elisha who had proved false and faithless as the cause of all the protracted distress.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If I do not this day take his head and life.

But he did not consider that the prophets could not work what miracles and when they pleased, but only as far as God saw fit, whose time was not yet come; otherwise it was Elisha’s interest as well as theirs to be freed from this distress. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes,....

But neither in one case nor the other does the sorrow appear to have worked any good result. ‘I find his sorrow, I find not his repentance. The worst man may grieve for his smart, only the good heart grieves for his offence’ (Bp Hall). The result of Jehoram’s anguish seems to have been only rage against Elisha.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes.</span> In horror and consternation at the terrible state of things revealed by the woman's story (comp. <a href="/2_kings/5-7.htm">2 Kings 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked.</span> It is better to translate, with our Revisers, (Now <span class="accented">he yeas passing by upon the wall</span>;) <span class="accented">and the people looked</span>; or, <span class="accented">and</span>, <span class="accented">as he was passing by upon the wall</span>, <span class="accented">the people looked</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.</span> Jehoram had secretly assumed the penitential garment, not a mere sign of woe, but a constant chastisement of the flesh. He wore sackcloth next his skin, no one suspecting it, until, in the exasperation of his feelings at the woman's tale, he rent his robe, and exposed to view the sackcloth which underlay it. We are scarcely entitled to deny him any true penitential feeling, though no doubt he was far from possessing a chastened or humble spirit. Poor weak humanity has at one and the same time good and evil impulses, praiseworthy and culpable feelings, thoughts which come from the Holy Spirit of God, and thoughts which are inspired by the evil one. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this there arose so fearful a famine in Samaria on the occasion of a siege by Benhadad, that one mother complained to the king of another, because she would not keep her agreement to give up her son to be eaten, as she herself had already done.</body></html>
