Even the sons of the prophets must not be unwilling to labour. Let no man think an honest employment a burden or a disgrace. And labour of the head, is as hard, and very often harder, than labour with the hands. We ought to be careful of that which is borrowed, as of our own, because we must do as we would be done by. This man was so respecting the axe-head. And to those who have an honest mind, the sorest grievance of poverty is, not so much their own want and disgrace, as being rendered unable to pay just debts. But the Lord cares for his people in their smallest concerns. And God's grace can thus raise the stony iron heart, which is sunk into the mud of this world, and raise up affections, naturally earthly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take every man a beam - Trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley.

He, therefore, raised no difficulty, but at once, in the simplest manner, acceded to the request. There is a remarkable directness, simplicity, and absence of fuss in all that Elisha says and does. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Gehazi came to the hill (&#1492;&#1506;&#1508;&#1500;, the well-known hill before the city) he took the presents from the bearers, and dismissing the men, laid them up in the house. &#1489;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;, to bring into safe custody. </body></html>
