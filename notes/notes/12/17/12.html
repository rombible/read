Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant.

The Israelites carried into exile. - After the taking of Samaria, Salmanasar led Israel into captivity to Assyria, and assigned to those who were led away dwelling-places in Chalach and on the Chabor, or the river Gozan, and in cities of Media. According to these clear words of the text, the places to which the ten tribes were banished are not to be sought for in Mesopotamia, but in provinces of Assyria and Media. &#1495;&#1500;&#1495; is neither the city of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495; built by Nimrod (<a href="/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>), nor the Cholwan of Abulfeda and the Syriac writers, a city five days' journey to the north of Bagdad, from which the district bordering on the Zagrus probably received the name of &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; or &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, but the province &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769; of Strabo (xi. 8, 4; 14, 12, and xvi. 1, 1), called &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769; by Ptolemaeus (vi. 1), on the eastern side of the Tigris near Adiabene, to the north of Nineveh on the border of Armenia. &#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is not the &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; in Upper Mesopotamia (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>, etc.), which flows into the Euphrates near Kirkesion (Carchemish), and is called Chebar (kbr) or Chabur (kbwr) by the Syriac writers, Chabr (xbr) by Abulfeda and Edrisi, &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; by Ptolemaeus, &#x391;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (Aboras) by Strabo and others, as Michaelis, Gesenius, Winer, and even Ritter assume; for the epithet "river of Gozan" is not decisive in favour of this, since Gozan is not necessarily to be identified with the district of Gauzanitis, now Kaushan, situated between the rivers of Chaboras and Saokoras, and mentioned in Ptol. v. 18, 4, inasmuch as Strabo (xvi. 1, 1, p. 736) also mentions a province called &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769; above Nineveh towards Armenia, between Calachene and Adiabene. Here in northern Assyria we also find both a mountain called &#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, according to Ptol. vi. 1, on the boundary of Assyria and Media, and the river Chabor, called by Yakut in the Moshtarik l-hsnh (Khabur Chasaniae), to distinguish it from the Mesopotamian Chaboras or Chebar. According to Marasz. i. pp. 333f., and Yakut, Mosht. p. 150, this Khabur springs from the mountains of the land of Zauzan, zawzan, i.e., of the land between the mountains of Armenia, Adserbeidjan, Diarbekr, and Mosul (Marasz. i. p. 522), and is frequently mentioned in Assemani as a tributary of the Tigris. It still bears the ancient name Khabr, taking its rise in the neighbourhood of the upper Zab near Amadjeh, and emptying itself into the Tigris a few hours below Jezirah (cf. Wichelhaus, pp. 471, 472; Asah. Grant, Die Nestorianer, v. Preiswerk, pp. 110ff.; and Ritter, Erdk. ix. pp. 716 and 1030). This is the river that we are to understand by &#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;.<p>It is a question in dispute, whether the following words &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1494;&#1503; &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; are in apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;: "by the Chabor the river of Gozan," or are to be taken by themselves as indicating a peculiar district "by the river Gozan." Now, however the absence of the prep. &#1489;, and even of the copula ,&#1493; on the one hand, and the words of Yakut, "Khabur, a river of Chasania," on the other, may seem to favour the former view, we must decide in favour of the latter, for the simple reason that in <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a> &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1494;&#1503; &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; is separated from &#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; morf d by &#1493;&#1492;&#1512;&#1488;. The absence of the preposition &#1489;&#1468; or of the copula &#1493; before &#1504;&#1492;&#1512; &#1490; in the passage before us may be accounted for from the assumption that the first two names, in Chalah and on the Khabur, are more closely connected, and also the two which follow, "on the river Gozan and in the cities of Media." The river Gozan or of Gozan is therefore distinct from &#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1512; (Khabur), and to be sought for in the district in which Gauzani'a, the city of Media mentioned by Ptol. (vi. 2), was situated. In all probability it is the river which is called Kisil (the red) Ozan at the present day, the Mardos of the Greeks, which takes its rise to the south-east of the Lake Urumiah and flows into the Caspian Sea, and which is supposed to have formed the northern boundary of Media.<p>(Note: The explanation given in the text of the geographical names, receives some confirmation from the Jewish tradition, which describes northern Assyria, and indeed the mountainous region or the district on the border of Assyria and Media towards Armenia, as the place to which the ten tribes were banished (vid., Wichelhaus ut sup. pp. 474ff.). Not only Ewald (Gesch. iii. p. 612), but also M. v. Niebuhr (Gesch. Ass. p. 159), has decided in favour of this view; the latter with this remark: "According to the present state of the investigations, Chalah and Chabor are no doubt to be sought for on the slope of the Gordyaean mountains in the Kalachene of Strabo, the Kalakine of Ptolemaeus, and on the tributary of the Tigris, which is still called Chabur, therefore quite close to Nineveh. The Yudhi mountains in this region possibly bear this name with some allusion to the colony." But with reference to the river Gozan, Niebuhr is doubtful whether we are to understand by this the Kisil Ozan or the waters, in the district of Gauzanitis by the Kehbar, and gives the preference to the latter as the simpler of the two, though it is difficulty to see in what respect it is simpler than the other.)<p>The last locality mentioned agrees with this, viz., "and in the cities of Media," in which Thenius proposes to read &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;, mountains, after the lxx, instead of &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;, cities, though without the least necessity. </body></html>
