But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change. Wordly settlements are uncertain; we know not whither we may be driven before we die, and we must soon leave the world; but the righteous hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They fear not the Lord - The new-comers in one sense feared Yahweh <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-33.htm">2 Kings 17:33</a>, <a href="/2_kings/17-41.htm">2 Kings 17:41</a>.

The settlers regarded this as a punishment from Jehovah, i.e., from the deity of the land, whom they did not worship, and therefore asked the king of Assyria for a priest to teach them the right, i.e., the proper, worship of God of the land; whereupon the king sent them one of the priests who had been carried away, and he took up his abode in Bethel, and instructed the people in the worship of Jehovah. The author of our books also looked upon the lions as sent by Jehovah as a punishment, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>, because the new settlers did not fear Him. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;: the lions which had taken up their abode there. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;: that they (the priest with his companions) went away and dwelt there. There is no need therefore to alter the plural into the singular.<p>The priest sent by the Assyrian king was of course an Israelitish priest of the calves, for he was one of those who had been carried away and settled in Bethel, the chief seat of Jeroboam's image-worship, and he also taught the colonists to fear or worship Jehovah after the manner of the land. This explains the state of divine worship in the land as described in <a href="/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. "Every separate nation (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;: see Ewald, 313, a.) made itself its own gods, and set them up in the houses of the high places (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;: see at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>, and for the singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, Ewald, 270, c.) which the Samaritans (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, not the colonists sent thither by Esarhaddon, but the former inhabitants of the kingdom of Israel, who are so called from the capital Samaria) had made (built); every nation in the cities where they dwelt."</body></html>
