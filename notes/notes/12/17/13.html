Abarbinel, in his commentary on these books, hath noticed one or more prophets in every king’s reign, both in Israel and Judah, from the time of Saul to Zedekiah, in whose time Jerusalem was laid desolate. The ten tribes had lately had among them two most singularly eminent for their zeal, courage, fidelity, and the wonders which they wrought, in the name of God, in confirmation of their divine mission and doctrine, namely, Elijah and Elisha: the latter of whom had been instrumental in rescuing them from their enemies sundry times, when all human means had failed, and their case appeared perfectly hopeless, and who had been mercifully continued to them, a faithful witness for God, and a burning and shining light, for about sixty years. And in the days of this very king, when Israel was carried away captive, they had Hoshea, Amos, Isaiah, and Micah. And in the days of the last king of Judah, when that tribe was carried captive, they had Jeremiah and Ezekiel. All these had made it their care to show both the kings and people their sins, and warn them of the fatal consequences of them; and to exhort, beseech, and urge them to turn from them, to the worship and service of the living and true God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-23 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly related, it is in these verses largely commented upon, and the reasons of it given. It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God raised up a succession of prophets and seers, who repeated and enforced the warnings of the Law, and breathed into the old words a new life.

God had never left himself without living witness. Besides the written testimony of the Law, he had sent them a continuous series of prophets, who "repeated and enforced the teaching of the Law by word of month, breathing into the old words a new life, applying them to the facts of their own times, urging them on the con- sciences of their hearers, and authoritatively declaring to them that the terrible threatenings of the Law were directed against the very sins which they habitually practiced." The prophets continually addressed them in the Name of God, saying, <span class="cmt_word">Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.</span> This was the general burden of the prophetical teaching, both in Israel and in Judah, both before the captivity of Israel and afterwards (see <a href="/hosea/12-6.htm">Hosea 12:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>; <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4-15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-6.htm">Isaiah 31:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7, 14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The causes which occasioned this catastrophe. - To the account of the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes, and of the transportation of its inhabitants into exile in Assyria, the prophetic historian appends a review of the causes which led to this termination of the greater portion of the covenant-nation, and finds them in the obstinate apostasy of Israel from the Lord its God, and in its incorrigible adherence to idolatry. <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, "and it came to pass when" (not because, or that): compare <a href="/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/44-24.htm">Genesis 44:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>; <a href="/judges/1-28.htm">Judges 1:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-7.htm">Judges 6:7</a>, etc. The apodosis does not follow till <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>, as <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-17</a> simply contain a further explanation of Israel's sin.
