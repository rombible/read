It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The strong expression "drave Israel" is an allusion to the violent measures whereto Jeroboam had recourse in order to stop the efflux into Judea of the more religious portion of his subjects <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-16</a>, the calling in of Shishak, and the permanent assumption of a hostile attitude toward the southern kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 17:7-41.

No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But willingly and resolutely followed the wicked example and commands of their kings, though contrary to God’s express commands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did,....

The worshipping of all the host of heaven is not specially mentioned in the history of the kingdom of the ten tribes, but occurs first of all in Judah in the time of Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>). The fact that the host of heaven is mentioned between Asherah and Baal shows that the historian refers to the Baal and Astarte worship, and has borrowed the expression from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>, to show the character of this worship, since both Baal and Astarte were deities of a sidereal nature.

There is no allusion to this worship in the history of the kingdom of the ten tribes, although it certainly existed in the time of Ahab. The second half of <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a> also refers to the conduct of Ahab (see at <a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>).</body></html>
