This they did, says Bp Hall, ‘not for devotion, but for impunity. Vain politicians to think to satisfy God by patching up religions … What a prodigious mixture was here, true with false, Jewish with paganish, divine with devilish … No beggar’s cloak is more pieced than the religion of these new inhabitants of Israel. I know not how their bodies sped for the lions. I am sure their souls fared the worse for this medley. Above all things God hates a mongrel devotion. If we be not all Israel, it were better to be all Asshur.

The word represented by ‘lowest’ means an ‘end’ or ‘extremity’, but the idea of the phrase is that the choice of these priests was made anywhere, from the whole mass of the nation, from all that was comprised in it between one extremity and the other. This was distinctly contrary to what the Jews had been taught, that the priests were to come exclusively from one tribe, and the high priests from a special family.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">houses of the high places</span>] Hence it seems that not an altar only, bat a temple of some kind was erected on the high places.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they feared the Lord</span> - rather, <span class="accented">and they</span> (<span class="accented">also</span>) <span class="accented">honored Jehovah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with their idolatrous worship they combined also the worship of Jehovah (comp. ver. 28) - <span class="cmt_word">and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span>, followed the example of Jeroboam in taking for priests persons of all ranks, even the lowest (see the comment on 1 Kings 12:31) - <span class="cmt_word">which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places</span> (comp. ver. 29). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the earliest period of their settlement in the cities of Samaria the new settlers were visited by lions, which may have multiplied greatly during the time that the land was lying waste. The settlers regarded this as a punishment from Jehovah, i.e., from the deity of the land, whom they did not worship, and therefore asked the king of Assyria for a priest to teach them the right, i.e., the proper, worship of God of the land; whereupon the king sent them one of the priests who had been carried away, and he took up his abode in Bethel, and instructed the people in the worship of Jehovah. The author of our books also looked upon the lions as sent by Jehovah as a punishment, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>, because the new settlers did not fear Him. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;: the lions which had taken up their abode there. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;: that they (the priest with his companions) went away and dwelt there. There is no need therefore to alter the plural into the singular.<p>The priest sent by the Assyrian king was of course an Israelitish priest of the calves, for he was one of those who had been carried away and settled in Bethel, the chief seat of Jeroboam's image-worship, and he also taught the colonists to fear or worship Jehovah after the manner of the land. This explains the state of divine worship in the land as described in <a href="/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. "Every separate nation (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;: see Ewald, 313, a.) made itself its own gods, and set them up in the houses of the high places (&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;: see at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>, and for the singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, Ewald, 270, c.) which the Samaritans (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, not the colonists sent thither by Esarhaddon, but the former inhabitants of the kingdom of Israel, who are so called from the capital Samaria) had made (built); every nation in the cities where they dwelt."</body></html>
