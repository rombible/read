It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The reasons for which God suffered the Israelites to be deprived of their land and carried into captivity were:<p>1. their idolatries;<p>2. their rejection of the Law;<p>3. their disregard of the warning voices of prophets and seers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 17:7-41.

No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God,....

A better form of introduction to this account of the causes of the captivity. These are recited under three heads. First, on entering Canaan Israel adopted the idol worship of the people of the land, and would not listen to the warnings of God’s prophets. Secondly, the ten tribes made the molten calves, and thirdly, they adopted the worship of Baal and Moloch and other idolatries from the more distant people, and indulged in all the practices of divination and enchantment which were attendant on these heathen forms of worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which had</span> [R.V. omits <span class="ital">had</span>] <span class="ital">brought them up</span>] This omission makes the clause refer, as it does in the Hebrew, exactly to the same time as ‘whom the Lord cast out’ in the following verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-23.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The provocations which induced God to destroy the Israelite kingdom. Here, for once, the writer ceases to be the mere historian, and becomes the religious teacher and prophet, drawing out the lessons of history, and justifying the ways of God to man. <span class="accented">As</span> Bahr says, he "<span class="accented">does</span> not carry on the narrative as taken from the original authorities, but himself here begins a review of the history and fate of Israel, which <span class="accented">ends</span> with ver. 23, and forms an independent section by itself." The section divides itself into four portions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> From ver. 7 to ver. 12, a general statement of Israel's wickedness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from ver. 13 to ver. 15, a special aggravation of their guilt, viz. their rejection of prophets; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> vers: 16 and 17 contain a specification of their chief acts of sin; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> from ver. 18 to ver. 23, a general summary, including some words of warning to Judah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God</span>; rather, <span class="accented">And it came to pass</span>, <span class="accented">when</span>, etc. The clauses from the present to the end of ver. 17 depend on the "when" of this verse; the apodosis does not come till ver. 18, "When the children of Israel had done all that is stated in vers. 7-17, then the result was that the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight." <span class="cmt_word">Which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt.</span> So commencing his long series of mercies to the nation, and indicating his gracious favor towards it. "The deliverance from Egypt," as Bahr well says, "was not only the beginning, but the symbol, of all Divine grace towards Israel, and the pledge of its Divine guidance." Hence the stress laid upon it, both here and by the Prophet Hoses (comp. <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-9.htm">Hosea 12:9, 13</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From under the hand</span>  - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the oppression - <span class="cmt_word">of Pharaoh King of Egypt, and had feared other gods</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reverenced and worshipped them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Hoshea King of Israel. - <a href="/2_kings/17-1.htm">2 Kings 17:1</a>. In the twelfth year of Ahaz began Hoshea to reign. As Hoshea conspired against Pekah, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, in the fourth year of Ahaz, and after murdering him made himself king, whereas according to the verse before us it was not till the twelfth year of Ahaz that he really became king, his possession of the throne must have been contested for eight years. The earlier commentators and almost all the chronologists have therefore justly assumed that there was en eight years' anarchy between the death of Pekah and the commencement of Hoshea's reign. This assumption merits the preference above all the attempts made to remove the discrepancy by alterations of the text, since there is nothing at all surprising in the existence of anarchy at a time when the kingdom was in a state of the greatest inward disturbance and decay. Hoshea reigned nine years, and "did that which was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, though not like the kings of Israel before him" (<a href="/2_kings/17-2.htm">2 Kings 17:2</a>). We are not told in what Hoshea was better than his predecessors, nor can it be determined with any certainty, although the assumption that he allowed his subjects to visit the temple at Jerusalem is a very probable one, inasmuch as, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10</a>., Hezekiah invited to the feast of the Passover, held at Jerusalem, the Israelites from Ephraim and Manasseh as far as to Zebulun, and some individuals from these tribes accepted his invitation. But although Hoshea was better than his predecessors, the judgment of destruction burst upon the sinful kingdom and people in his reign, because he had not truly turned to the Lord; a fact which has been frequently repeated in the history of the world, namely, that the last rulers of a decaying kingdom have not been so bad as their forefathers. "God is accustomed to defer the punishment of the elders in the greatness of His long-suffering, to see whether their descendants will come to repentance; but if this be not the case, although they may not be so bad, the anger of God proceeds at length to visit iniquity (cf. <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>)."
