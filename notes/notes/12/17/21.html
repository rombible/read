It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The strong expression "drave Israel" is an allusion to the violent measures whereto Jeroboam had recourse in order to stop the efflux into Judea of the more religious portion of his subjects <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-16</a>, the calling in of Shishak, and the permanent assumption of a hostile attitude toward the southern kingdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 17:7-41.

No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They made Jeroboam king; </span> which action is here ascribed to the people, because they would not tarry till God, by his providence, had invested Jeroboam with the kingdom which he had promised him; but rashly, and unthankfully, and rebelliously rose up against the house of David, to which they had such great obligations, and set him upon the throne without God’s leave or advice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord; </span> he not only dissuaded, but kept them by force from God’s worship at Jerusalem, the only place appointed for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A great sin; </span> so the worship of the calves is called, to meet with that idle conceit of the Israelites, who esteemed it a small sin, especially when they were forced to it by severe penalties; which yet he shows did not excuse it from being a sin, and a great sin too. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he rent Israel from the house of David,....

The commencement of the calf-worship was through Jeroboam, and no doubt he used every means in his power to constrain his subjects to follow in his ways. The frequently recurring phrase ‘the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin’ is justification for even such a strong verb as ‘to drive’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he rent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for he</span> had rent. The nexus of the verse is with ver. 18. The difference between the fates of Israel and Judah - the survival of Judah for a hundred and thirty-four years - is traced back to the separation under Rehoboam, and to the wicked policy which Jeroboam then pursued, and left as a legacy to his successors. Israel could suffer alone, while Judah was spared, because the kingdom of David and Solomon had been rent in twain, and the two states had thenceforth continued separate. <span class="cmt_word">Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord.</span> The separation alone might not have had any ill result; but it was followed by the appointment of Jeroboam as king, and Jeroboam introduced the fatal taint of idolatry, from which all the other evils flowed, including the earlier destruction of the northern kingdom.
