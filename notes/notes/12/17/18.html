It was destruction from the Almighty: the Assyrian was but the rod of his anger, Isa 10:5. Those that bring sin into a country or family, bring a plague into it, and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows. And vast as the outward wickedness of the world is, the secret sins, evil thoughts, desires, and purposes of mankind are much greater. There are outward sins which are marked by infamy; but ingratitude, neglect, and enmity to God, and the idolatry and impiety which proceed therefrom, are far more malignant. Without turning from every evil way, and keeping God's statutes, there can be no true godliness; but this must spring from belief of his testimony, as to wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness, and his mercy in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a> note, and see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2-5</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 17:7-41.

For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned&#8212;There is here given a very full and impressive vindication of the divine procedure in punishing His highly privileged, but rebellious and apostate, people. No wonder that amid so gross a perversion of the worship of the true God, and the national propensity to do reverence to idols, the divine patience was exhausted; and that the God whom they had forsaken permitted them to go into captivity, that they might learn the difference between His service and that of their despotic conquerors.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Out of his sight, </span> i.e. out of Canaan, the only place of God’s solemn worship and gracious presence; or, out of his church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The tribe of Judah only; </span> and the greatest part of the tribe of Benjamin, and those of the tribes of Simeon and Levi, who adhered to them, and were incorporated with them; and therefore very fitly denominated from them: <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/1_kings/11-13.htm" title="However, I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.">1 Kings 11:13</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel,....

God’s eye was regarded as specially directed to the land of Canaan, where He had chosen to place His Name. So to be taken away from that land is a removal from His special oversight. By the ‘tribe of Judah’ is meant the kingdom. Cf. <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm" title="And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.">1 Kings 11:36</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that then the Lord was very angry</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. We have here the apodosis of the long sentence beginning with ver. 7 and continuing to the end of ver. 17. When all that is enumerated in these verses had taken place, then the Lord was moved to anger against Israel, then matters had reached a crisis, the cup of their iniquity was full, and God's wrath, long restrained, descended on them. <span class="cmt_word">And removed them out of his sight.</span> Removal out of God's sight is loss of his favor and of his care. "The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous" (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>) - he "knoweth their way," "watcheth ever them" (<a href="/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a>), "careth for them" (<a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>); but "the countenance of the Lord is against them [averted from them] who do evil" (<a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>). He will not look upon them nor hear them. <span class="cmt_word">There was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</span> The "tribe of Judah" stands for the kingdom of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin (see <a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31-36</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-23.htm">1 Kings 12:23</a>; '<a href="/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>), into which the greater part of Dan and Simeon had also been absorbed. This became now, exclusively, God's "peculiar people," the object of his love and of his care. The writer, it must be remembered, belongs to the period of the Captivity, and is not speaking of the restored Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They served the clods, i.e., worshipped clods or masses of stone as gods (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, see at <a href="/1_kings/15-12.htm">1 Kings 15:12</a>), notwithstanding the command of God in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>., <a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>, etc.</body></html>
