But such will form unworthy thoughts of God, will expect to please him by outward forms, and will vainly try to reconcile his service with the love of the world and the indulgence of their lusts. May that fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom, possess our hearts, and influence our conduct, that we may be ready for every change.

He expects his words to reach the ears of the mixed race inhabiting Samaria in his day, and would fain warn them against their idolatrous practices, and point them to the pure worship of Jehovah. It is pleasing to remember that ultimately the mixed race was won to the true faith, and that the Samaritans of our Lord's time were as true worshippers of Jehovah, and as zealous followers of the Law, as the Jews themselves. The interesting community at Nablous still maintains Samaritan forms, and reads the Samaritan Pentateuch. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In addition to these idols, Jehovah also was worshipped in temples of the high places, according to the instructions of the Israelitish priest sent by the king of Assyria. &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;: "and they were (also) worshipping Jehovah, and made themselves priests of the mass of the people" (&#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; as in <a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>). &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;: "and they (the priests) were preparing them (sacrifices) in the houses of the high places."</body></html>
