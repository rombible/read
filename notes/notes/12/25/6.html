In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To Riblah - See <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a> note. A position from where Nebuchadnezzar could most conveniently superintend the operations against Tyre and Jerusalem.

His sons and the nobles who had joined in his flight were slain before his eyes (Jer 39:6; 52:10). In conformity with Eastern ideas, which consider a blind man incapable of ruling, his eyes were put out, and being put in chains, he was carried to perpetual imprisonment in Babylon (Jer 52:11), which, though he came to it, as Ezekiel had foretold, he did not see (Jer 32:5; Eze 12:13; 17:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To Riblah; </span> of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm" title="And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.">2 Kings 23:33</a>"</span>, and <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/2_kings/25-21.htm" title="And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath.

No doubt the proceeding was of this kind.

The Egyptian and Persian artists also represent it. To Riblah. (For the situation of Riblah, see the comment on 2 Kings 23:33.) As Nebuchadnezzar was engaged at one and the same time in directing the sieges both of Tyro and of Jerusalem, it was a most convenient position for him to occupy. <span class="cmt_word">And they gave judgment upon him.</span> As a rebel, who had broken his covenant and his oath (<a href="/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16, 18</a>), Zedekiah was brought to trial before Nebuchadnezzar and his great lords. The facts could not be denied, and sentence was therefore passed upon him, nominally by the court, practically by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). By an unusual act of clemency, his life was spared; but the judgment was still sufficiently severe (see the next verse). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For because of the wrath of the Lord it happened concerning Judah and Jerusalem." The subject to &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; is to be taken from what precedes, viz., Zedekiah's doing evil, or that such a God-resisting man as Zedekiah became king. "Not that it was of God that Zedekiah was wicked, but that Zedekiah, a man (if we believe Brentius, in loc.) simple, dependent upon counsellors, yet at the same time despising the word of God and impenitent (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-12.htm">2 Chronicles 36:12-13</a>), became king, so as to be the cause of Jerusalem's destruction" (Seb. Schm.).

"And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babel," who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>, had made him swear by God, to whom he was bound by oath to render fealty. This breach of covenant and frivolous violation of his oath Ezekiel also condemns in sharp words (<a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>.), as a grievous sin against the Lord. Zedekiah also appears from the very first to have had no intention of keeping the oath of fealty which he took to the king of Babel with very great uprightness. For only a short time after he was installed as king he despatched an embassy to Babel (<a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>), which, judging from the contents of the letter to the exiles that Jeremiah gave to the ambassadors to take with them, can hardly have been sent with any other object that to obtain from the king of Babel the return of those who had been carried away. Then in the fourth year of his reign he himself made a journey to Babel (<a href="/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>), evidently to investigate the circumstances upon the spot, and to ensure the king of Babel of his fidelity. And in the fifth month of the same year, probably after his return from Babel, ambassadors of the Moabites, Ammonites, Tyrians, and Sidonians came to Jerusalem to make an alliance with him for throwing off the Chaldaean yoke (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>). Zedekiah also had recourse to Egypt, where the enterprising Pharaoh Hophra (Apries) had ascended the throne; and then, in spite of the warnings of Jeremiah, trusting to the help of Egypt, revolted from the king of Babel, probably at a time when Nebuchadnezzar (according to the combinations of M. v. Nieb., which are open to question however) was engaged in a war with Media. </body></html>
