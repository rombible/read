Many however, no doubt, were put to the sword, the victorious army being much exasperated by their obstinacy. To account, in some degree, for the besieged making their escape, Josephus observes, that as the city was taken about midnight, the enemies’ captains, with the rest of the soldiers, went directly into the temple, which Zedekiah perceiving, took his wives, children, commanders, and friends, and they all slipped away together, by a narrow passage, toward the wilderness. But what this narrow passage was, is still a question. The Jews think there was a subterraneous passage from the palace to the plains of Jericho, and that the king and his courtiers might endeavour to make their escape that way. And we learn from Dion, that in the last siege of Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jews had covered ways, which lay under the walls of the city, to a considerable distance into the country, out of which they were wont to sally, and fall upon the Romans that were straggling from the camp: but since neither Josephus nor the sacred historian takes notice of any such subterraneous passage at this siege, it is most likely that the Chaldeans having made a breach in the wall, many of the besieged escaped through it, proceeding privately between the wall and the outworks, by a passage which the Chaldeans did not suspect. <span class="ital">The king went toward the plain — </span>Of Jericho, as it follows.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-7 Jerusalem was so fortified, that it could not be taken till famine rendered the besieged unable to resist. In the prophecy and Lamentations of Jeremiah, we find more of this event; here it suffices to say, that the impiety and misery of the besieged were very great. At length the city was taken by storm. The king, his family, and his great men escaped in the night, by secret passages. But those deceive themselves who think to escape God's judgments, as much as those who think to brave them. By what befell Zedekiah, two prophecies, which seemed to contradict each other, were both fulfilled. Jeremiah prophesied that Zedekiah should be brought to Babylon, Jer 32:5; 34:3; Ezekiel, that he should not see Babylon, Eze 12:13. He was brought thither, but his eyes being put out, he did not see it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The city was broken up - Rather, "broken into," i. e., A breach was made about midnight in the northern wall <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>, and an entry effected into the second or lower city (see the <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a> note), which was protected by the wall of Manasseh <a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>.<p>Precipitate flight followed on the advance of the Babylonians to the "middle gate," or gate of communication between the upper and the lower cities.

On the contrary, the two accounts are simply brief extracts from one common and more elaborate history of the later times of the kingdom of Judah, possibly composed by Jeremiah or Baruch, analogous to the two extracts from the history of Hezekiah in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36-39</a>. - More minute accounts of this space of time are given in the historical portions of the prophecies of Jeremiah (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39.htm">Jeremiah 39-44</a>), which form an explanatory commentary to the section before us.)<p><a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18-19</a><p>Length and spirit of Zedekiah's reign (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-1.htm">Jeremiah 52:1-3</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-11.htm">2 Chronicles 36:11-13</a>). - Zedekiah's mother Hamital, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, was also the mother of Jehoahaz (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>); consequently he was his own brother and the half-brother of Jehoiakim, whose mother was named Zebidah (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36</a>). His reign lasted eleven years, and in its attitude towards the Lord exactly resembled that of his brother Jehoiakim, except that Zedekiah does not appear to have possessed so much energy for that which was evil. According to <a href="/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/38-24.htm">Jeremiah 38:24</a>., he was weak in character, and completely governed by the great men of his kingdom, having no power or courage whatever to offer resistance. but, like them, he did not hearken to the words of the Lord through Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/37-2.htm">Jeremiah 37:2</a>), or, as it is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-12.htm">2 Chronicles 36:12</a>, "he did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spake to him out of the mouth of the Lord."</body></html>
