No, that will not be fireproof against God’s judgments; this stately structure must be laid in ashes, and it is probable the ark in it; for the enemies, probably having heard how dear the Philistines paid for the abusing it, durst not seize it; nor did any of its friends take care to preserve it; for then we should have heard of it again in the second temple.” The temple was burned four hundred years after the time that it was built, says Sir John Marsham; four hundred and twenty-four years three months and eight days, says Archbishop Usher; four hundred thirty years, says Abarbinel and other learned Jews; but Josephus computes the matter still higher; for he tells us that the temple was burned four hundred and seventy years six months and ten days after the building of it; one thousand and sixty years six months and ten days from the time of the Israelites coming out of the land of Egypt; one thousand nine hundred, and fifty years six months and ten days from the deluge; three thousand five hundred and thirty years six months and ten days from the creation; and he mentions it as a very remarkable circumstance, that the second temple was burned by the Romans in the same month and on the very same day of the month that this was set on fire by the Chaldeans, and, as some of the Jewish rabbis say, when the Levites were singing the very same passage, namely, <span class="ital">He shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness: yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off</span>, <a href="/psalms/94-23.htm" title="And he shall bring on them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yes, the LORD our God shall cut them off.">Psalm 94:23</a>.

By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He burnt the house of the Lord - Compare the prophecies of Jeremiah Jer 21:10; <a href="/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-18.htm">Jeremiah 38:18</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/38-23.htm">Jeremiah 38:23</a>. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1-13</a> is thought to have been written soon after this destruction of the temple. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-18. on the seventh day of the month &#8230; came Nebuzar-adan&#8212;(compare Jer 52:12). In attempting to reconcile these two passages, it must be supposed either that, though he had set out on the seventh, he did not arrive in Jerusalem till the tenth, or that he did not put his orders in execution till that day. His office as captain of the guard (Ge 37:36; 39:1) called him to execute the awards of justice on criminals; and hence, although not engaged in the siege of Jerusalem (Jer 39:13), Nebuzar-adan was despatched to rase the city, to plunder the temple, to lay both in ruins, demolish the fortifications, and transport the inhabitants to Babylon. The most eminent of these were taken to the king at Riblah (2Ki 25:27) and executed, as instigators and abettors of the rebellion, or otherwise obnoxious to the Assyrian government. In their number were Seraiah, the high priest, grandfather of Ezra (Ezr 7:1), his sagan or deputy, a priest of the second order (Jer 21:2; 29:25, 29; 37:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He burnt the house of the Lord, </span> which had now stood about four hundred and fifty years. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month,....

Neither the Assyrians nor the Babylonians had any regard for the gods of other nations. They everywhere burnt the temples, plundered the shrines, and carried off the images as trophies of victory. In the temple of Jerusalem they would find no images except those of the two cherubim (<a href="/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-28</a>), which they probably took away with them. <span class="cmt_word">And the king's house</span> (see <a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1, 8-12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-16.htm">2 Kings 11:16</a>). The royal palace was, perhaps, almost as magnificent as the temple; and its destruction was almost as great a loss to art. It doubtless contained Solomon's throne of ivory (<a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>), to which there was an ascent by six steps, with two sculptured lions on each step. <span class="cmt_word">And all the houses of Jerusalem.</span> This statement is qualified by the words of the following clause, which show that only the houses of the princes and great men were purposely set on fire.

The statement of the month is omitted in our text, where the words &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/39-2.htm">Jeremiah 39:2</a>) have fallen out before &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-3.htm">2 Kings 25:3</a>, commencement) through the oversight of a copyist. The overwhelming extent of the famine is mentioned, not "because the people were thereby rendered quite unfit to offer any further resistance" (Seb. Schm.), but as a proof of the truth of the prophetic announcements (<a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-13.htm">Jeremiah 27:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>). &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1506;&#1501; are the common people in Jerusalem, or the citizens of the capital. From the more minute account of the entrance of the enemy into the city in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3-5</a> we learn that the Chaldaeans made a breach in the northern or outer wall of the lower city, i.e., the second wall, built by Hezekiah and Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>), and forced their way into the lower city (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>), so that their generals took their stand at the gate of the centre, which was in the wall that separated the lower city from the upper city upon Zion, and formed the passage from the one to the other. When Zedekiah saw them here, he fled by night with the soldiers out of the city, through the gate between the two walls at or above the king's garden, on the road to the plain of the Jordan, while the Chaldaeans were round about the city. In <a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a> a faulty text has come down to us. In the clause &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; the verb &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is omitted, if not even more, namely &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;, "fled and went out of the city." And if we compare <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>, it is evident that before &#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;still more has dropped out, not merely &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, which must have stood in the text, since according to <a href="/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a> the king was among the fugitives; but most probably the whole clause &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1512;&#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;, since the words &#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; have no real connection with what precedes, and cannot form a circumstantial clause so far as the sense is concerned. The "gate between the two walls, which (was) at or over (&#1506;&#1500;) the king's garden," was a gate at the mouth of the Tyropoeon, that is to say, at the south-eastern corner of the city of Zion; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>, the king's garden was at the pool of Siloah, i.e., at the mouth of the Tyropoeon (see Rob. Pal. ii. 142). By this defile, therefore, the approach to the city was barred by a double wall, the inner one running from Zion to the Ophel, whilst the outer one, at some distance off, connected the Zion wall with the outer surrounding wall of the Ophel, and most probably enclosed the king's garden. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; is &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, which has dropped out before &#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is the lowland valley on both sides of the Jordan (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>).</body></html>
