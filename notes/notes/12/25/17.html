By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare with this description the accounts in marginal references.

In attempting to reconcile these two passages, it must be supposed either that, though he had set out on the seventh, he did not arrive in Jerusalem till the tenth, or that he did not put his orders in execution till that day. His office as captain of the guard (Ge 37:36; 39:1) called him to execute the awards of justice on criminals; and hence, although not engaged in the siege of Jerusalem (Jer 39:13), Nebuzar-adan was despatched to rase the city, to plunder the temple, to lay both in ruins, demolish the fortifications, and transport the inhabitants to Babylon. The most eminent of these were taken to the king at Riblah (2Ki 25:27) and executed, as instigators and abettors of the rebellion, or otherwise obnoxious to the Assyrian government. In their number were Seraiah, the high priest, grandfather of Ezra (Ezr 7:1), his sagan or deputy, a priest of the second order (Jer 21:2; 29:25, 29; 37:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord,....

But this view is precluded by <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>, where we find &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; instead of &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; or &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; .&#1497; These words cannot be set aside by the arbitrary assumption that they crept into the text through a copyist's error; for the assertion that they contain a purposeless repetition is a piece of dogmatical criticism, inasmuch as there is a distinction drawn in <a href="/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a> between &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1503;&#1468; and &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;.

Either &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; means the fighting people left in the city, as distinguished from the deserters who had fled to the Chaldaeans, and &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>, or &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>, the rest of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; is the people left in Jerusalem (warriors and non-warriors), and &#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; the rest of the population of the land outside Jerusalem. The latter is probably the preferable view, not only because full justice is thereby done to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; in the first clause, but also because it is evident from the exception mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a> that the deportation was not confined to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but extended to the population of the whole land. The "poor people," whom he allowed to remain in the land as vine-dressers and husbandmen, were the common people, or people without property, not merely in Jerusalem, but throughout the whole land. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;   (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>).

Instead of the Chethb &#1500;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, secuit, aravit, the Keri has &#1500;&#1497;&#1490;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1497;&#1490;&#1489;, in the same sense, after <a href="/jeremiah/52-16.htm">Jeremiah 52:16</a>.</body></html>
