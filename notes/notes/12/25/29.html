But the things of their peace were so hidden from their eyes, that they knew not when they were well off. Ishmael basely slew him and all his friends, and, against the counsel of Jeremiah, the rest went to Egypt. Thus was a full end made of them by their own folly and disobedience; see Jeremiah chap. 40 to 45. Jehoiachin was released out of prison, where he had been kept 37 years. Let none say that they shall never see good again, because they have long seen little but evil: the most miserable know not what turn Providence may yet give to their affairs, nor what comforts they are reserved for, according to the days wherein they have been afflicted. Even in this world the Saviour brings a release from bondage to the distressed sinner who seeks him, bestowing foretastes of the pleasures which are at his right hand for evermore.

Our translators preferred the latter, our Revisers the former. In either case the general meaning is the same. Evil Merodach supplied suitable garments to the released monarch instead of his "prison garments," and Jehoiachin arrayed himself in the comely apparel before taking his seat among his equals. Dresses of honor are among the most common gifts which an Oriental monarch makes to his subjects (see <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8, 11</a>; <a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 5:1. &sect; 1). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin - <span class="cmt_word">did eat bread continually before him.</span> Besides giving occasional great feasts (see <a href="/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3-9</a>), Oriental monarchs usually entertain at their table daily a large number of guests, some of whom are specially invited, while others have the privilege of daily attendance (see ' Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 214, 215). It was to this latter class that Jehoiachin was admitted. Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>, which shows that the custom was one not unknown at the Jewish court. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin's - <span class="cmt_word">life.</span> Jehoisohin enjoyed this privilege till his death. Whether this fell in the lifetime of Evil-Merodach or not, is scarcely in the writer's thoughts. He merely means to tell us that the comparative comfort and dignity which Jehoiachin enjoyed after the accession of Evil-Merodach to the throne was not subsequently clouded over or disturbed. He continued a privileged person at the Baby-Ionian court so long as he lived. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Installation of Gedaliah the governor.

Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, who had interested himself on behalf of the prophet Jeremiah and saved his life (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), and the grandson of Shaphan, a man of whom nothing more is known (see at <a href="/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>), had his home in Jerusalem, and, as we may infer from his attitude towards Jeremiah, had probably secured the confidence of the Chaldaeans at the siege and conquest of Jerusalem by his upright conduct, and by what he did to induce the people to submit to the judgment inflicted by God; so that Nebuchadnezzar entrusted him with the oversight of those who were left behind in the land-men, women, children, poor people, and even a few princesses and court-officials, whom they had not thought it necessary or worth while to carry away (<a href="/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm">Jeremiah 41:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/41-16.htm">Jeremiah 41:16</a>), i.e., he made him governor of the conquered land. Mizpah is the present Nebi Samwil, two hours to the north-west of Jerusalem (see at <a href="/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>). - On hearing of Gedaliah's appointment as governor, there came to him "all the captains of the several divisions of the army and their men," i.e., those portions of the army which had been scattered at the flight of the king (<a href="/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a>), and which had escaped from the Chaldaeans, and, as it is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>, had dispersed themselves "in the field," i.e., about the land.

Ishmael, son of Mattaniah and grandson of Elishama, probably of the king's secretary mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-20.htm">Jeremiah 36:20</a>, of royal blood. Nothing further is known about the other names. We simply learn from <a href="/jeremiah/40-13.htm">Jeremiah 40:13</a>. that Johanan had warned Gedaliah against the treachery of Ishmael, and that when Gedaliah was slain by Ishmael, having disregarded the warning, he put himself at the head of the people and marched with them to Egypt, notwithstanding the dissuasions of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/41-15.htm">Jeremiah 41:15</a>.). Instead of "Johanan the son of Kareah," we have in <a href="/jeremiah/40-8.htm">Jeremiah 40:8</a> "Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah;" but it is uncertain whether &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; has crept into the text of Jeremiah from the previous &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1495;&#1504;&#1503; merely through a mistake, and this mistake has brought with it the alteration of &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (Ewald), or whether &#1493;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; has dropped out of our text through an oversight, and this omission has occasioned the alteration of &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; into &#1489;&#1503; (Thenius, Graf, etc.).
