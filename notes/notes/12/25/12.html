By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There was probably an intention of seating colonists into the country from some other part of the Empire, as the Assyrians had done in Samaria <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-18. on the seventh day of the month &#8230; came Nebuzar-adan&#8212;(compare Jer 52:12). In attempting to reconcile these two passages, it must be supposed either that, though he had set out on the seventh, he did not arrive in Jerusalem till the tenth, or that he did not put his orders in execution till that day. His office as captain of the guard (Ge 37:36; 39:1) called him to execute the awards of justice on criminals; and hence, although not engaged in the siege of Jerusalem (Jer 39:13), Nebuzar-adan was despatched to rase the city, to plunder the temple, to lay both in ruins, demolish the fortifications, and transport the inhabitants to Babylon. The most eminent of these were taken to the king at Riblah (2Ki 25:27) and executed, as instigators and abettors of the rebellion, or otherwise obnoxious to the Assyrian government. In their number were Seraiah, the high priest, grandfather of Ezra (Ezr 7:1), his sagan or deputy, a priest of the second order (Jer 21:2; 29:25, 29; 37:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month,....

In the Assyrian sculptures we see the captives, who are carried off, generally accompanied by their own baggage-animals, and taking with them a certain amount of their own household stuff. Pauper immigrants would not have been of any advantage to a country. To be vinedressers and husbandmen. Jeremiah adds that Nebuzar-adan "gave" these persons "vineyards and fields at the same time" (<a href="/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>). The Babylonians did not wish Judaea to lie waste, since it could then have paid no tribute. On the contrary, they designed its continued cultivation; and Gedaliah, the governor of their appointment, made great efforts to have cultivation resumed and extended (see <a href="/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10, 12</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Zedekiah having been seized by the Chaldaeans, was taken to the king of Babel in the Chaldaean headquarters at Riblah (see at <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>), and was there put upon his trial. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>, Nebuchadnezzar had commenced the siege of Jerusalem in person; but afterwards, possibly not till after the Egyptians who came to relieve the besieged city had been repulsed, he transferred the continuance of the siege, which was a prolonged one, to his generals, and retired to Riblah, to conduct the operations of the whole campaign from thence. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508;&#1500; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, to conduct judicial proceedings with any one, i.e., to hear and judge him.
