By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fugitives ... - It was from a fear of the treatment which he would receive at the hands of these deserters that Zedekiah persisted in defending the city to the last <a href="/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-18. on the seventh day of the month &#8230; came Nebuzar-adan&#8212;(compare Jer 52:12). In attempting to reconcile these two passages, it must be supposed either that, though he had set out on the seventh, he did not arrive in Jerusalem till the tenth, or that he did not put his orders in execution till that day. His office as captain of the guard (Ge 37:36; 39:1) called him to execute the awards of justice on criminals; and hence, although not engaged in the siege of Jerusalem (Jer 39:13), Nebuzar-adan was despatched to rase the city, to plunder the temple, to lay both in ruins, demolish the fortifications, and transport the inhabitants to Babylon. The most eminent of these were taken to the king at Riblah (2Ki 25:27) and executed, as instigators and abettors of the rebellion, or otherwise obnoxious to the Assyrian government. In their number were Seraiah, the high priest, grandfather of Ezra (Ezr 7:1), his sagan or deputy, a priest of the second order (Jer 21:2; 29:25, 29; 37:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The people that were left in the city, </span> whom neither the sword nor famine had destroyed, who were eight hundred and thirty-two persons, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/jeremiah/52-29.htm" title="In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:">Jeremiah 52:29</a></span>, being members and traders of that city; for it is likely that there were very many more of the country people who were fled thither, who were left with others of their brethren to manure the land, as it here follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The remnant of the multitude, </span> to wit, of the inhabitants of the country. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month,....

Having burnt the temple, the royal palace, and the grand residences of the principal citizens, Nebuzar-adan proceeded to divide the inhabitants of the city and country into two bodies - those whom he would leave in the land, and those whom he would carry off. The line of demarcation was, in a general way, a social one. The rich and well-to-do he would take with him; the poor and insignificant he would leave behind (vers. 11, 12). Among the former were included the high priest, the "second priest," three of the temple Levites, the commandant of the city, a certain number of the royal councilors, the "principal scribe of the host," and sixty of the "princes" (vers. 18, 19). The latter were chiefly persons of the agricultural class, who were left to be "vinedressers and husbandmen." From the temple, which had been already plundered twice (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-7.htm">2 Chronicles 36:7, 10</a>), he carried off such vessels in gold and silver and bronze as were still remaining there, together with the bronze of the two pillars Jachin and Boaz, of the great laver, or "molten sea," and of the stands for the smaller layers, all of which he broke up (ver. 13). Having reached Riblah, where Nebuchadnezzar still was, he delivered up to him both the booty and the prisoners. Rather more than seventy of the latter Nebuchadnezzar punished with death (ver. 21). The rest were taken to Babylon. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the people that were left in the city</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that remained behind when the king and the garrison fled - <span class="cmt_word">and the fugitives that fen away to the King of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude</span>; rather, <span class="accented">both the fugitives that had fallen away to the King of Babylon</span>, <span class="accented">and the remnant of the multitude</span>, The writer means to divide "the rest of the people" into two classes: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> those who during the siege, or before it, had deserted to the Babylonians, as no doubt many did, and as Jeremiah was accused of doing (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those who were found inside the city when it was taken. <span class="cmt_word">Did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the Chaldaeans were encamped around the city, the flight was immediately discovered.
