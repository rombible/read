By this, God showed how little he cares for the outward pomp of his worship, when the life and power of religion are neglected. The walls of Jerusalem were thrown down, and the people carried captive to Babylon. The vessels of the temple were carried away. When the things signified were sinned away, what should the signs stand there for? It was righteous with God to deprive those of the benefit of his worship, who had preferred false worships before it; those that would have many altars, now shall have none. As the Lord spared not the angels that sinned, as he doomed the whole race of fallen men to the grave, and all unbelievers to hell, and as he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, we need not wonder at any miseries he may bring upon guilty nations, churches, or persons.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The pillars of brass ... - All the more precious treasures had been already removed from the temple <a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>.

Objects in brass, or rather bronze, were frequently carried off by the Assyrians from the conquered nations. Bronze was highly valued, being the chief material both for arms and implements. The breaking up of the pillars, bases, etc., shows that it was for the material, and not for the workmanship, that they were valued.

In attempting to reconcile these two passages, it must be supposed either that, though he had set out on the seventh, he did not arrive in Jerusalem till the tenth, or that he did not put his orders in execution till that day. His office as captain of the guard (Ge 37:36; 39:1) called him to execute the awards of justice on criminals; and hence, although not engaged in the siege of Jerusalem (Jer 39:13), Nebuzar-adan was despatched to rase the city, to plunder the temple, to lay both in ruins, demolish the fortifications, and transport the inhabitants to Babylon. The most eminent of these were taken to the king at Riblah (2Ki 25:27) and executed, as instigators and abettors of the rebellion, or otherwise obnoxious to the Assyrian government. In their number were Seraiah, the high priest, grandfather of Ezra (Ezr 7:1), his sagan or deputy, a priest of the second order (Jer 21:2; 29:25, 29; 37:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The shovels; </span> of these and the following words, <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm" title="And you shall make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits.">Exodus 27:1</a>"</span> See <span class="bld"> 1Ki 6 1Ki 7</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord,....

Instead of the seventh day we have the tenth in <a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>. This difference might be reconciled, as proposed by earlier commentators, on the assumption that the burning of the city lasted several days, commencing on the seventh and ending on the tenth. But since there are similar differences met with afterwards (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm">2 Kings 25:17</a>, <a href="/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>) in the statement of numbers, which can only be accounted for from the substitution of similar numeral letters, we must assume that there is a change of this kind here. Which of the two dates is the correct one it is impossible to determine. The circumstance that the later Jews kept the ninth as a fast-day cannot be regarded as decisive evidence in favour of the date given in Jeremiah, as Thenius supposes; for in <a href="/zechariah/7-3.htm">Zechariah 7:3</a> and <a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a> the fasting of the fifth month is mentioned, but no day is given; and though in the Talmudic times the ninth day of the month began to be kept as a fast-day, this was not merely in remembrance of the Chaldaean destruction of Jerusalem, but of the Roman also, and of three other calamities which had befallen the nation (see the statement of the Gemara on this subject in Lightfoot, Opp. ii. p. 139, ed. Leusden, and in Khler on <a href="/zechariah/7-3.htm">Zechariah 7:3</a>), from which we see that the Gemarists in the most unhistorical manner grouped together different calamitous events in one single day. The nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar corresponds to the eleventh of Zedekiah (see at <a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>). Nebuzaradan is not mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a> among the Chaldaean generals who forced their way into the city, so that he must have been ordered to Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar after the taking of the city and the condemnation of Zedekiah, to carry out the destruction of the city, the carrying away of the people, and the appointment of a deputy-governor over those who were left behind in the land. This explains in a very simple manner how a month could intervene between their forcing their way into the city, at all events into the lower city, and the burning of it to the ground, without there being any necessity to assume, with Thenius, that the city of Zion held out for a month, which is by no means probable, for the simple reason that the fighting men had fled with Zedekiah and had been scattered in their flight. &#1512;&#1489;&#1470;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in <a href="/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a>, was with the Babylonians, as with the Egyptians, the chief of the king's body-guard, whose duty it was to execute the sentences of death (see at <a href="/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>). &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; answers to the &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; of the Israelites (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, etc.).
