His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mighty of the land - Or "the great," "the powerful."

The Keri &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is substantially correct, but is an unnecessary alteration of the Chethb &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, since the verb when it precedes the subject is not unfrequently used in the singular, though before a plural subject (cf.
