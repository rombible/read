He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem”(<a href="/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>; comp. <a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit on the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.">Jeremiah 36:30</a>).

Ewald supposes that he was lured out of Jerusalem to a pretended conference with the Chaldeans, and then treacherously seized, and, as he proved a refractory prisoner, slain, and his body denied the last honours, his family craving its restoration in vain. (The words of the text do not necessarily imply <span class= "ital">a natural and peaceful</span> death, as Thenius alleges, but simply <span class= "ital">death</span> without further qualification.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_kings/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm" title="So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.">2 Kings 24:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers — </span>But it is not said he was buried with them.

Jehoiachin and Jeconiah both mean "Yahweh will establish," Coniah, "Yahweh establishes." Probably his original name was Jehoiachin. When he ascended the throne, and was required to take a new name, anxious not to lose the good men contained in his old one, he simply transposed the two elements. Jeremiah shortened this new name from Jeconiah to Coniah, thus cutting off from it the notion of futurity, to imply that that would not be which the name declared would be. In other words, "Yahweh establishes," but this prince he will not establish. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Whether he fell in fight with the numberless invaders, or, as seems suggested by the form of the prophecies quoted in the previous note, was slain by his own subjects and his body cast forth from the city we cannot decide.

His body may, however, possibly have been found by the Jews after the Babylonians had withdrawn from before Jerusalem, and have been entombed with those of Manasseh, Amen, and Josiah. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead, Josephus says</span> (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) that Nebuchadnezzar placed him upon the throne, which is likely enough, since he would certainly not have quitted Jerusalem without setting up some king or other. Jehoiachin has in Scripture the two other names of Jeconiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-16.htm">1 Chronicles 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-20.htm">Jeremiah 27:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-4.htm">Jeremiah 28:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>) and Coniah (<a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24, 28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>). Jehoiachin and Jeconiah differ only, as Jehoahaz and Ahaziah, by a reversal of the order of the two elements. Both mean "Jehovah will establish (him)." "Conlah" cuts off from "Jeconiah" the sign of futurity, and means "Jehovah establishes." It is used only by Jeremiah, and seems used by him to signify that though "Jehovah establishes," Jeconiah he would <span class="accented">not</span> establish. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jehoiakim (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5-8</a>). - Jehoiakim reigned eleven years in the spirit of his ungodly forefathers (compare <a href="/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a> with <a href="/2_kings/23-32.htm">2 Kings 23:32</a>). Jeremiah represents him (<a href="/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>.) as a bad prince, who enriched himself by the unjust oppression of his people, "whose eyes and heart were directed upon nothing but upon gain, and upon innocent blood to shed it, and upon oppression and violence to do them" (compare <a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22-23</a>).
