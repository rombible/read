Unto this revolt, it is probable, he was persuaded by the ambassadors which the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, sent unto him, to solicit him to throw off the yoke of the king of Babylon, <a href="/context/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,...">Jeremiah 27:2-4</a>, &c.; which was the greater crime, because he had taken a solemn oath that he would be true to him, <a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>.

His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It came to pass - Some prefer "came this to pass:" in the sense. "Through the anger of the Lord was it that another had king ruled in Jerusalem and in Judah:" concluding the chapter with the word "presence;" and beginning the next chapter with the words, "And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."<p>Rebelled - The Book of Jeremiah explains the causes of rebellion. In Zedekiah's early years there was an impression, both at Jerusalem <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1-11</a> and at Babylon <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-5.htm">Jeremiah 29:5-28</a>, that Nebuchadnezzar was inclined to relent. By embassy to Babylon <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>, and a personal visit <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>, Zedekiah strove hard to obtain the restoration of the captives and the holy vessels. But he found Nebuchadnezzar obdurate. Zedekiah returned to his own country greatly angered against his suzerain, and immediately proceeded to plot a rebellion. He sought the alliance of the kings of Tyre, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and Edom <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>, and made overtures to Hophra, in Egypt, which were favorable received <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>, whereupon he openly revolted, apparently in his ninth year, 588 B.C. Tyre, it must be remembered, was all this time defying the power of Nebuchadnezzar, and thus setting an example of successful revolt very encouraging to the neighboring states. Nebuchadnezzar, while constantly maintaining an army in Syria, and continuing year after year his attempts to reduce Tyre (compare <a href="/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18</a>) was, it would seem, too much occupied with other matters, such, probably, as the reduction of Susiana <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34-38</a>, to devote more than a small share of his attention to his extreme western frontier. In that same year, however (588 B.C.), the new attitude taken by Egypt induced him to direct to that quarter the main force of the Empire, and to take the field in person. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. through the anger of the Lord &#8230; he cast them out from his presence&#8212;that is, in the course of God's righteous providence, his policy as king would prove ruinous to his country.<p>Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon&#8212;instigated by ambassadors from the neighboring states who came to congratulate him on his ascension to the throne (compare Jer 17:3, with Jer 28:1), and at the same time get him to join them in a common league to throw off the Assyrian yoke. Though warned by Jeremiah against this step, the infatuated and perjured (Eze 17:13) Zedekiah persisted in his revolt.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus the people’s sins were the true cause why God gave them wicked kings, whom he suffered to do wickedly, that they might bring the long deserved and threatened punishments upon themselves and their people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Zedekiah was twenty years old when he began to reign,....

The picture in <a href="/context/2_chronicles/36-14.htm" title="Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem....">2 Chronicles 36:14-16</a>, sets before us the way in which the evil doings had corrupted all classes. ‘The chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the Lord. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by His messengers, rising up betimes and sending, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling-place. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and misused His prophets until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till there was no remedy’. God was deemed to be specially present in the temple at Jerusalem, hence the captivity was a removal from His sight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">and</span>] <span class="ital">Zedekiah rebelled</span>] It is better to translate the conjunction as the mere copulative, putting a strong stop after ‘presence’. There were several stages in Zedekiah’s progress to complete revolt. The Chronicler (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-12.htm" title="And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 36:12</a>) says that Nebuchadnezzar had made the new king swear unto him by God, perhaps thinking such an oath would be more binding than if he sware by any other oath. We know (<a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm" title="By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,">Jeremiah 29:3</a>) that Zedekiah sent an embassy to the king of Babylon, apparently with the desire of getting back the captives who had been taken away with Jeconiah. If this were really his wish it did not succeed, and thus the wish to revolt may have arisen. A little later Zedekiah went himself in the company of Seraiah (<a href="/jeremiah/51-59.htm" title="The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.">Jeremiah 51:59</a>) to Babylon. This was in the fourth year of his reign. Amid all these communications with the conqueror, we learn (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a>) that messengers came to Jerusalem from the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon, who all seemed anxious to form a league against Babylon. Zedekiah listened to false prophets like Hananiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/28-1.htm" title="And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,...">Jeremiah 28:1-4</a>), who told him that the yoke of the king of Babylon was to be broken and the captives all to be brought back, and along with them the vessels of the house of the Lord. Disappointed of his petitions, and encouraged by the kings round about him, and by the smooth things he heard at home, Zedekiah revolted, probably refusing to pay the yearly tribute and sending (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm" title="But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?">Ezekiel 17:15</a>) down to Egypt to obtain help in horses and chariots. Presently afterwards the Babylonian armies came once more against Jerusalem.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For through the anger of the Lord it came to pus in Jerusalem and Judah.</span> It was "through the anger of the Lord" at the persistent impenitence of the people, that that came to pass which actually came to pass - the rejection of the nation by God and the casting of it out of his presence. In his anger he suffered the appointment of another perverse and faithless monarch, who made no attempt at a reformation of religion, and allowed him to run his evil course unchecked, and to embroil himself with his suzerain, and to bring destruction upon his nation. God's anger, long provoked (<a href="/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10-15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26, 27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3, 4</a>), lay at the root of the whole series of events, not causing men's sins, but allowing them to go on until the cup of their iniquities was full, and the time had arrived for vengeance. <span class="cmt_word">Until he had east them out from his presence</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18, 20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-27.htm">2 Kings 23:27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>). To be "cast out of God's presence" is to lose his protecting care, to be separated off from him, to be left defenseless against our enemies. When Israel was once finally cast off, its fate was sealed; there was no further hope for it; the end was come. <span class="cmt_word">That Zedekiah rebelled against the King of Babylon</span>; rather, And <span class="accented">Zedekiah rebelled</span>, etc. The sentence is a detached one, and would, perhaps, better commence <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>. than terminate, as it does, <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>. Zedekiah, when he received his investiture at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar (ver. 17), took a solemn oath of allegiance and fidelity (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>) to him and to his successors; but almost immediately afterwards he began to intrigue with Egypt, sent a contingent of troops to help Psamatik II. in his wars (Wiediemann, 'Geschichte AEgyptens,' p. 159), and thus sought to pave the way for an Egyptian alliance, on the strength of which he might venture upon a revolt. It was probably owing to the suspicions which these acts aroused that, in the fourth year of his reign,  <span class="date">B.C. 594</span>, he had to visit Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>), where, no doubt, he renewed his engagements and assured the Babylonian monarch of his fidelity. But these proceedings were nothing but a blind. On the accession of Hophra (Apries) to the throne of Egypt in  <span class="date">B.C. 591</span>, Zedekiah renewed his application to the Egyptian court, openly sending ambassadors (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>), with a request for infantry and cavalry. Thus was his rebellion complete, his "oath despised," and his "covenant broken" (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15, 16</a>). The war with Babylon, and the siege of Jerusalem, were the natural consequences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Beside these treasures, he carried away captive to Babylon the cream of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, not only the most affluent, but, as is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a>, the best portion in a moral respect.

By the &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are meant, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>, the &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, chamberlains, i.e., the officials of the king's court in general, and by &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; ("the mighty of the land") all the heads of the tribes and families of the nation that were found in Jerusalem; and under the last the priests and prophets, who were also carried away according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1</a>, with Ezekiel among them (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), are included as the spiritual heads of the people. The &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; are called &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; in <a href="/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>; their number was 7000. The persons intended are not warriors, but men of property, as in <a href="/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>. The second class of those who ere carried away consisted of &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, all the workers in stone, metal, and wood, that is to say, masons, smiths, and carpenters; and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, the locksmiths, including probably not actual locksmiths only, but makers of weapons also. There is no need for any serious refutation of the marvellous explanation given of &#1502;&#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512; by Hitzig (on <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>), who derives it from &#1502;&#1505; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;, and supposes it to be an epithet applied to the remnant of the Canaanites, who had been made into tributary labourers, although it has been adopted by Thenius and Graf, who make them into artisans of the foreign socagers. &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (<a href="/2_kings/25-12.htm">2 Kings 25:12</a>), the poor people of the land, i.e., the lower portion of the population of Jerusalem, from whom Nebuchadnezzar did not fear any rebellion, because they possessed nothing (<a href="/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>), i.e., neither property (money nor other possessions), nor strength and ability to organize a revolt. The antithesis to these formed by the &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497; &#1502; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, the strong or powerful men, who were in a condition to originate and carry on a war; for this category includes all who were carried away, not merely the thousand workmen, but also the seven thousand &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, and the king's officers and the chiefs of the nation, whose number amounted to two thousand, since the total number of the exiles was then thousand. There is no special allusion to warriors or military, because in the struggle for the rescue of the capital and the kingdom from destruction every man who could bear arms performed military service, so that the distinction between warriors and non-warriors was swept away, and the actual warriors are swallowed up in the ten thousand. Babel is the country of Babylonia, or rather the Babylonian empire. </body></html>
