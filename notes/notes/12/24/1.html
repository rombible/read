Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, and second monarch of the Babylonian empire, ascended the throne, 604 B.C., and reigned 43 years, dying 561 B.C. He married Amuhia (or Amyitis), daughter of Cyaxares, king of the Medes, and was the most celebrated of all the Babylonian sovereigns. No other pagan king occupies so much space in Scripture. He was not actual king at this time, but only Crown Prince and leader of the army under his father.

This invasion took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's, and the first of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (Jer 25:1; compare Jer 46:2). The young king of Assyria being probably detained at home on account of his father's demise, despatched, along with the Chaldean troops on his border, an army composed of the tributary nations that were contiguous to Judea, to chastise Jehoiakim's revolt from his yoke. But this hostile band was only an instrument in executing the divine judgment (2Ki 24:2) denounced by the prophets against Judah for the sins of the people; and hence, though marching by the orders of the Assyrian monarch, they are described as sent by the Lord (2Ki 24:3).Jehoiakim, first subdued by Nebuchadnezzar, rebelleth against him to his own ruin: Jehoiachin his son is king in his stead, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/2_kings/24-1.htm" title="In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him....">2 Kings 24:1-6</a></span>.

The Egyptian king had probably left his army at Carchemish on his own return to Egypt. After routing the Egyptian force the king of Babylon came forward to attack those lands which had submitted to Pharaoh, Judah among the rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nebuchadnezzar was the son and successor of Nabopolassar, who founded the Babylonian Empire. It was while Nebuchadnezzar was engaged in this expedition against the Egyptians and their allies that he was recalled to take the throne of Babylon. He had been acting as general for his father, though to the Jewish mind he would appear as king of Babylon, especially as he so soon after became in reality king and was made known to them as such by terrible experience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jehoiakim became his servant three years</span>] i.e. He undertook to pay a certain yearly tribute to Babylon. The conqueror appears also to have carried off captives from Jerusalem, for it was at this time that Daniel and his companions were taken away (<a href="/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a>). It would seem from the history in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-6.htm" title="Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.">2 Chronicles 36:6</a> that Nebuchadnezzar’s intention had been to take Jehoiakim away, for it is stated that he ‘bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon’. See on this also the language of <a href="/ezekiel/19-9.htm" title="And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.">Ezekiel 19:9</a>. But by some means he was maintained on his throne. After three years of vassalage, however, he rebelled, probably thinking that he could get help from Egypt.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his days Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">Nebuchadnezzar</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">Nebuchadnezzar</span>, Jeremiah, Ezekiel) represents the Babylonian <span class="accented">Nabu-kudur-uzur</span> ("Nebo is the protector of landmarks"), a name very common in the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions. It was borne by three distinct kings of Babylon, the most important of whom was Nebuchadnezzar III., the son of Nabopolassar, the monarch of the present passage. According to Berosus, he was not at the time of this expedition the actual sovereign of Babylonia, but only the crown prince, placed by the actual king, Nabopolassar, at the head of his army. It is possible that his father may have associated him in the kingdom, for association was not unknown at Babylon; or the Jews may have mistaken his position; or the historian may call him king by <span class="accented">prolepsis</span>, as a modern might say, "The Emperor Napoleon invaded Italy and defeated the Austrians at Marengo" (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 400). His father had grown too old and infirm to conduct a military expedition, and consequently sent his son in his place, with the object of chastising Nechoh, and recovering the territory whereof Nechoh had made himself master three years before (see <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-33</a>, and compare below, ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiakim became his servant</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> submitted to him, and became a tributary king - <span class="cmt_word">three years</span> (from  <span class="date">B.C. 605</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 602</span>): <span class="cmt_word">then he turned and rebelled against him.</span> How Jehoiakim came to venture on this step we are not told, and can only conjecture. It is, perhaps, most probable that (as Josephus says, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:6, &sect; 2) he was incited to take this course by the Egyptians, who were still under the rule of the brave and enterprising Nechoh, and who may have hoped to wipe out by fresh victories the disaster experienced at Carehemish. There is, perhaps, an allusion to Jehoiakim's expectation of Egyptian succors in the statement of ver. 7, that "the King of Egypt came not again any more out of his land." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jehoahaz (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-1.htm">2 Chronicles 36:1-4</a>). - Jehoahaz, called significantly by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>) Shallum, i.e., "to whom it is requited," reigned only three months, and did evil in the eyes of the Lord as all his fathers had done. The people (or the popular party), who had preferred him to his elder brother, had apparently set great hopes upon him, as we may judge from Jer 22:10-12, and seem to have expected that his strength and energy would serve to avert the danger which threatened the kingdom on the part of Necho. Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/19-3.htm">Ezekiel 19:3</a>) compares him to a young lion which learned to catch the prey and devoured men, but, as soon as the nations heard of him, was taken in their pit and led by nose-rings to Egypt, and thus attributes to him the character of a tyrant disposed to acts of violence; and Josephus accordingly (Ant. x. 5, 2) describes him as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. </body></html>
