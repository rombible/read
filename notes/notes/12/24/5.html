Jehoiakim was taken prisoner, and brought in chains to Nebuchadnezzar, who at first designed to convey him to Babylon, but afterward had him taken to Jerusalem, where he was executed. Afterward, when the Babylonians had withdrawn, the remains were collected and interred in the burying-place of Manasseh, so that the king ultimately "slept with his fathers" <a href="/2_kings/24-6.htm">2 Kings 24:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. the Lord would not pardon&#8212;(see on [356]2Ki 23:26; Jer 15:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,....

So the prophecy of the Lord against Jehoiakim was, ‘He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David’. In another place Jeremiah foretells (<a href="/context/2_kings/22-18.htm" title="But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which you have heard;...">2 Kings 22:18-19</a>) the fate which shall befall him. ‘They shall not lament for him … he shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem’. And in another passage, ‘His dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost’. The evil and self-indulgent character of Jehoiakim is abundantly set forth in <a href="/context/jeremiah/22-11.htm" title="For thus said the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:...">Jeremiah 22:11-17</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim; and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> Among the acts of Jehoiakim recorded elsewhere in the Old Testament, the most remarkable are the following: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> His execution of Urijah the son of Shemaiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his destruction of the first collection of the early prophecies made by Jeremiah, in a fit of anger at hearing its contents (<a href="/jeremiah/36-20.htm">Jeremiah 36:20-23</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> his order that Jeremiah and Baruch should be arrested (<a href="/jeremiah/36-26.htm">Jeremiah 36:26</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> his capture by some of the "nations" which Nebuchadnezzar had stirred up against him, and delivery into the hands of that monarch (<a href="/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a>), probably at Jerusalem. How Nebuchadnezzar treated him is uncertain. Josephus says ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) that he put him to death, and east him out unburied beyond the walls of the city. But from the biblical notices we can only gather that he died prematurely after a reign of no more than eleven years ( <span class="date">B.C. 608</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 597</span>), and was u-lamented, "buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). Conjecture has filled up the blanks of this history in several ways, the most purely imaginative being, perhaps, that of Ewald, who says ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 262), "When the Chaldean armies presented themselves at the gates of the capital, Jehoiakim seems to have been betrayed into the same error as his brother (Jehoahaz), eleven years before. He gave ear to a crafty invitation of the enemy to repair for negotiations to their camp, where, in sight of his own city, he was made prisoner. He offered a frantic resistance, and was dragged away in a scuffle, and miserably cut down; while even an honorable burial for his corpse, which his family certainly solicited, was refused." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jehoiakim (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5-8</a>). - Jehoiakim reigned eleven years in the spirit of his ungodly forefathers (compare <a href="/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a> with <a href="/2_kings/23-32.htm">2 Kings 23:32</a>). Jeremiah represents him (<a href="/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>.) as a bad prince, who enriched himself by the unjust oppression of his people, "whose eyes and heart were directed upon nothing but upon gain, and upon innocent blood to shed it, and upon oppression and violence to do them" (compare <a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22-23</a>). Josephus therefore describes him as &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2; (Ant. x. 5, 2).
