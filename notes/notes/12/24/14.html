It is obvious that by deporting “the craftsmen and smiths” the king of Babylon made further outbreaks impossible (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm" title="Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:">1Samuel 13:19</a>.) Kimchi’s explanation of “smiths” is a curiosity of exegesis.

His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The entire number of the captives was not more than 11,000.

Hence all the people of rank, of wealth, and of skill as handicraftsmen are deported, and only the poorest folk left, who had neither knowledge nor means for doing more than work of drudgery. The total number of captives was 10,000. In verse 16 the numbers of some classes are specified, the ‘men of might’ were 7000, and the craftsmen 1000, which leaves 2000 for the royal household and their retainers, and the princes and the others who are spoken of in the general phrase as ‘strong and apt for war’. Such men it would have been dangerous to leave behind. In this captivity the prophet Ezekiel was included. See <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he carried away all Jerusalem.</span> The expression has to be limited by what follows. "All Jerusalem" means all that was important in the population of Jerusalem all the upper classes, the "princes" and "nobles," all the men trained to the use of arms, and all the skilled craftsmen and artisans of the city. The poor and weak and unskilled were left. The number deported, according to our author, was either ten or eleven thousand. The whole population of the ancient city has been calculated from its area at fifteen thousand. The largest estimate of the population of the modern city is seventeen thousand. <span class="cmt_word">And all the princes.</span> The <span class="accented">sarim</span>, or "princes," are not males of the blood royal, but the nobles, or upper classes of Jerusalem (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10-16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And all the mighty men of valor</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the trained troops" (Ewald); not "all the men of wealth," as Bahr renders - <span class="cmt_word">even ten thousand captives.</span> As the soldiers are reckoned below (ver. 16) at seven thousand, and the craftsmen at one thousand, the upper-class captives would seem to have been two thousand; unless, indeed, the "craftsmen" are additional to the ten thousand, in which Case the upper-class captives would have numbered three thousand, and the prisoners have amounted altogether to eleven thousand. <span class="cmt_word">And all the craftsmen and smiths.</span> Ewald understands "the <span class="accented">military</span> workmen and siege engineers" to be intended ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 263, note 9); but the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>in Hebrew includes all workers in stone, metal, or wood (<a href="/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>), and there is nothing to limit it here to <span class="accented">military</span> craftsmen.

There are still "princes" in Jerusalem under Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4, 25, 27</a>), and courtiers of rank (<a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), and "captains of forces" (<a href="/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>), and "men of war" (<a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>).

Ezekiel (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-5.htm">Ezekiel 19:5-7</a>) describes him not only as a young lion, who learned to prey and devoured men, like Jehoahaz, but also affirms of him that he knew their (the deceased men's) widows, i.e., ravished them, and destroyed their cities-that is to say, he did not confine his deeds of violence to individuals, but extended them to all that was left behind by those whom he had murdered, viz., to their families and possessions; and nothing is affirmed in <a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a> respecting his character at variance with this.
