His uncle was intrusted with the government. This Zedekiah was the last of the kings of Judah. Though the judgments of God upon the three kings before him might have warned him, he did that which was evil, like them. When those intrusted with the counsels of a nation act unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to notice the displeasure of God in it. It is for the sins of a people that God hides from them the things that belong to the public peace. And in fulfilling the secret purposes of his justice, the Lord needs only leave men to the blindness of their own minds, or to the lusts of their own hearts. The gradual approach of Divine judgments affords sinners space for repentance, and believers leisure to prepare for meeting the calamity, while it shows the obstinacy of those who will not forsake their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He did that which was evil - The character of Zedekiah seems to have been weak rather than wicked.

But, according to the custom of conquerors, who changed the names of the great men they took captives in war, in token of their supremacy, he gave him the new name of<p>Zedekiah&#8212;that is, "The righteous of God."

He allowed the people to continue their "pollutions" and" abominations" (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). He let the "princes" have their way, and do whatever they pleased (<a href="/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a>), contenting himself with sometimes outwitting them, and counteracting their proceeding (<a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-28</a>). He fell into the old error of "putting trust in Egypt" (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-7</a>), and made an alliance with Apries (Pharaoh-Hophra), which was an act of rebellion, at once against God and against his Babylonian suzerain.

This time he took the gold off the larger vessels, which were simply plated with that metal, such as the altar of burnt-offering, the table of shew-bread and ark of the covenant, and carried it away as booty, so that on the third conquest of Jerusalem, in the time of Zedekiah, beside a few gold and silver basins and scoops (<a href="/2_kings/25-15.htm">2 Kings 25:15</a>) there were only the large brazen vessels of the court remaining (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-18.htm">Jeremiah 27:18</a>.).
