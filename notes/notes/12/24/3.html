This invasion took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's, and the first of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (Jer 25:1; compare Jer 46:2). The young king of Assyria being probably detained at home on account of his father's demise, despatched, along with the Chaldean troops on his border, an army composed of the tributary nations that were contiguous to Judea, to chastise Jehoiakim's revolt from his yoke. But this hostile band was only an instrument in executing the divine judgment (2Ki 24:2) denounced by the prophets against Judah for the sins of the people; and hence, though marching by the orders of the Assyrian monarch, they are described as sent by the Lord (2Ki 24:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For the sins of Manasseh; </span> properly and directly for their own sins, and occasionally for the sins of Manasseh, which had never been charged upon them, if they had not made them their own by their impenitency for them, and repetition of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Surely at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight,....

As W. G. Sumner well observes, "The sins of Manasseh had become a designation for a certain class of offences, and a particular form of public and social depravity, which was introduced by Manassseh, but of which generation after generation continued to be guilty." The special sins were <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> idolatry, accompanied by licentious rites; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> child-murder, or sacrifice to Moloch; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> sodomy (<a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the use of enchantments and the practice of magical arts (<a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the words "Necho made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of his father Josiah," it follows that the king of Egypt did not acknowledge the reign of Jehoahaz, because he had been installed by the people without his consent. "And changed his name into Jehoiakim." The alteration of the name was a sign of dependence. In ancient times princes were accustomed to give new names to the persons whom they took into their service, and masters to give new names to their slaves (cf. <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>, and Hvernick on the last passage). - But while these names were generally borrowed from heathen deities, Eliakim, and at a later period Mattaniah (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>), received genuine Israelitish names, Jehoiakim, i.e., "Jehovah will set up," and Zidkiyahu, i.e., "righteousness of Jehovah;" from which we may infer that Necho and Nebuchadnezzar did not treat the vassal kings installed by them exactly as their slaves, but allowed them to choose the new names for themselves, and simply confirmed them as a sign of their supremacy. Eliakim altered his name into Jehoiakim, i.e., El (God) into Jehovah, to set the allusion to the establishment of the kingdom, which is implied in the name, in a still more definite relation to Jehovah the covenant God, who had promised to establish the seed of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>), possibly with an intentional opposition to the humiliation with which the royal house of David was threatened by Jeremiah and other prophets. - "But Jehoahaz he had taken (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, like &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; in <a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>), and he came to Egypt and died there" - when, we are not told. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>, even before the account of Jehoiakim's reign, we have fuller particulars respecting the payment of the tribute which Necho imposed upon the land (<a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>), because it was the condition on which he was appointed king. - "The gold and silver Jehoiakim gave to Pharaoh; yet (&#1488;&#1498;  equals  but in order to raise it) he valued (&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; as in <a href="/leviticus/27-8.htm">Leviticus 27:8</a>) the land, to give the money according to Pharaoh's command; of every one according to his valuation, he exacted the silver and gold of the population of the land, to give it to Pharaoh Necho." &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1474;, to exact tribute, is construed with a double accusative, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; placed first for the sake of emphasis, as an explanatory apposition to &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;. </body></html>
