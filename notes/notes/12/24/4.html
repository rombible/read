Thenius thinks the murder of some prominent personage, such as Isaiah, may be intended, and wishes to distinguish between the statement of the first clause of the verse and the second; but <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm" title="Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.">2Kings 21:16</a>, where the two statements are connected more closely, does not favour this view.<p><span class= "bld">Which the Lord would not pardon.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">and Jehovah willed not to pardon</span>. We must not soften the statement of <a href="/context/2_kings/24-3.htm" title="Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;">2Kings 24:3-4</a>, as Bähr does, by asserting the meaning to be that the nation was punished, not for the sins of Manasseh, but for its persistence in the same kind of sins. The sins of Manasseh are regarded as a climax in Judah’s long course of provocation: the cup was full, and judgment ready to fall. It was only suspended for a time, not revoked, in the reign of the good king Josiah. In short, the idea of the writer is that the innocent blood shed by Manasseh cried to heaven for vengeance, and that the ruin of the kingdom was the answer of the All righteous Judge. It is no objection to say, that in that case children suffered for their fathers’ misdeeds; that was precisely the Old Testament doctrine, until Ezekiel proclaimed another (<a href="/ezekiel/18-19.htm" title="Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.">Ezekiel 18:19</a>; comp. <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>). Looking at the catastrophe from a different standpoint, <span class= "ital">we</span> may remember that national iniquities must be chastised in the present life, if at all; and that the sufferings of the exile were necessary for the purification of Israel from its inveterate tendency to apostatise from Jehovah.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-7 If Jehoiakim had served the Lord, he had not been servant to Nebuchadnezzar. If he had been content with his servitude, and true to his word, his condition had been no worse; but, rebelling against Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble.

"And changed his name into Jehoiakim." The alteration of the name was a sign of dependence. In ancient times princes were accustomed to give new names to the persons whom they took into their service, and masters to give new names to their slaves (cf. <a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>; <a href="/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>, and Hvernick on the last passage). - But while these names were generally borrowed from heathen deities, Eliakim, and at a later period Mattaniah (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>), received genuine Israelitish names, Jehoiakim, i.e., "Jehovah will set up," and Zidkiyahu, i.e., "righteousness of Jehovah;" from which we may infer that Necho and Nebuchadnezzar did not treat the vassal kings installed by them exactly as their slaves, but allowed them to choose the new names for themselves, and simply confirmed them as a sign of their supremacy. Eliakim altered his name into Jehoiakim, i.e., El (God) into Jehovah, to set the allusion to the establishment of the kingdom, which is implied in the name, in a still more definite relation to Jehovah the covenant God, who had promised to establish the seed of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>), possibly with an intentional opposition to the humiliation with which the royal house of David was threatened by Jeremiah and other prophets. - "But Jehoahaz he had taken (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, like &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; in <a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>), and he came to Egypt and died there" - when, we are not told. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>, even before the account of Jehoiakim's reign, we have fuller particulars respecting the payment of the tribute which Necho imposed upon the land (<a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>), because it was the condition on which he was appointed king. - "The gold and silver Jehoiakim gave to Pharaoh; yet (&#1488;&#1498;  equals  but in order to raise it) he valued (&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; as in <a href="/leviticus/27-8.htm">Leviticus 27:8</a>) the land, to give the money according to Pharaoh's command; of every one according to his valuation, he exacted the silver and gold of the population of the land, to give it to Pharaoh Necho." &#1504;&#1490;&#1513;&#1474;, to exact tribute, is construed with a double accusative, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; placed first for the sake of emphasis, as an explanatory apposition to &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1501;. </body></html>
