But his reign was a very active as well as eventful one, and is fully related (2Ch 26:1-23). Elated by the possession of great power, and presumptuously arrogating to himself, as did the heathen kings, the functions both of the real and sacerdotal offices, he was punished with leprosy, which, as the offense was capital (Nu 8:7), was equivalent to death, for this disease excluded him from all society. While Jotham, his son, as his viceroy, administered the affairs of the kingdom&#8212;being about fifteen years of age (compare 2Ki 15:33)&#8212;he had to dwell in a place apart by himself (see on [342]2Ki 7:3).

The Chronicler however says that the king’s successes caused his heart to be lifted up, and he presumed to go into the temple, and to take upon him the priest’s office of burning incense. He was withstood by the priest (also called Azariah) and by fourscore other priests, but in his anger he persisted, and then it was that the leprosy rose up in his forehead. Whereupon he hasted to go forth from the temple because the Lord had smitten him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and dwelt in a several house</span>] The noun here is connected with the adjective that signifies ‘free’ and which is used of manumitted slaves. It has been suggested that the meaning here is that the place was one where those lived who could no longer mix with their fellows, and take part in the ordinary business of life. But in that case the building would be a public one or it would not have been so called. It appears therefore better to consider that the house was ‘free’ in the sense of ‘standing apart’, not mixed up among other dwellings. It was perhaps some place in the country to which the king confined himself after the disease had broken out upon him. The R.V. gives ‘lazar-house’ on the margin, but we must not suppose that the king went into a home devoted to such sufferers. He would live alone. The LXX. makes a sort of transliteration of the word but does not translate. The Vulgate has <span class="ital">in domo libera seorsum</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the English word ‘several’ in the sense of ‘separate’, cf.

Eliakim is mentioned as the most prominent person among those who were sent to confer with Rabshakeh, and to consult the prophet Isaiah, but the duties he performed were those of a subject. And though Jotham is here said to have judged the people of the land, we cannot from this conclude that he was joint ruler with his father.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord smote the king.</span> This comes in somewhat strangely, following close upon a statement that the king "did that which was <span class="accented">right</span> in the sight of the Lord." We have to go to Chronicles for an explanation. By Chronicles it appears that, in the earlier portion of his reign, Azariah was a good and pious prince, and that God blessed him in all his undertakings. Not only did he recover Eloth (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-2.htm">2 Chronicles 26:2</a>), but he carried on a successful war with the Philistines - took Garb, Jabneh (Jamnia), and Ashdod, and dismantled them (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), defeated the Arabians of Gur-Baal, and the Mehuuim or Maonites (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a>), forced the Ammonites to pay him a tribute, and caused his power to be known and feared far and wide (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>). The standing army which he maintained numbered 307,500 men, under 2600 officers, well armed and equipped with shields, spears, helmets, breast-plates, bows, and slings (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12-14</a>). "His name spread far abroad, for he was wonderfully helped" (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>). This marvelous prosperity developed in him a pride equal to that of his father, but one which vented itself differently, Azariab, deeming himself superior to all other men, and exempt from ordinary rules, boldly invaded the priestly office, took a censer, and entered into the temple, and proceeded to burn incense upon the golden altar that was before the veil (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-18</a>). It was then that "the Lord smote the king." As, in defiance of the high priest and his attendant train, who sought to prevent the lawless act, Azariah persisted in his endeavors, God struck him with leprosy, his forehead grew white with the unmistakable scaly scab, and in a moment his indomitable pride was quelled. The priests closed in upon him and began to thrust him out, but no violence was necessary. Aware of what had happened, "he himself also hasted to go out, because the Lord had smitten him" (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>). It is not very clear why the writer of Kings passes over these facts; but certainly they are not discredited by his silence. At any rate, those who accept the entire series of conquests, whereof the writer of Kings says nothing, on the sole authority of Chronicles, are logically precluded from rejecting the circumstances accompanying the leprosy, which is acknowledged by the writer of Kings, and viewed as a judgment from God. <span class="cmt_word">So that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house</span> (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>). Lepers had to be separated from the congregation - to "dwell alone" - "without the camp" (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). Ahaziah's "several house" is regarded by some as an "infirmary," or "hospital for lepers" (Ewald, Gesenius, Winer); but there is no reason to believe that hospitals of any kind existed among the Israelites. The lepers mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/7-3.htm">2 Kings 7:3</a> are houseless. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> is best translated "house of separation" and understood of a house standing by itself in the open country, separate from others. "Probably the house in which the leprous king lived was," as Bahr says, "especially built for him." <span class="cmt_word">And Jotham the Mug's son was over the house</span> - not over the "several house," but over the royal palace - <span class="cmt_word">judging the people of the land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> executing the royal functions, whereof "judging" was one of the highest. Azariah's infirmity made a regency necessary, and naturally his eldest son held the office. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of the rest of the history of Jeroboam we have nothing more than an intimation that he brought back Damascus and Hamath of Judah to Israel, i.e., subjugated it again to the kingdom of Israel. &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; is a periphrastic form for the genitive, as proper names do not admit of any form of the construct state, and in this case the simple genitive would not have answered so well to the fact. For the meaning is: "whatever in the two kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath had formerly belonged to Judah in the times of David and Solomon." By Damascus and Hamath we are not to understand the cities, but the kingdoms; for not only did the city of Hamath never belong to the kingdom of Israel, but it was situated outside the boundaries laid down by Moses for Israel (see at <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>). It cannot, therefore, have been re-conquered (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;) by Jeroboam. It was different with the city of Damascus, which David had conquered and even Solomon had not permanently lost (see at <a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>). Consequently in the case of Damascus the capital is included in the kingdom.</body></html>
