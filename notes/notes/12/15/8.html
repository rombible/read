Zechariah's Reign over Israel.<p>8-10. In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel&#8212;There was an interregnum from some unknown cause between the reign of Jeroboam and the accession of his son, which lasted, according to some, for ten or twelve years, according to others, for twenty-two years, or more. This prince pursued the religious policy of the calf-worship, and his reign was short, being abruptly terminated by the hand of violence. In his fate was fulfilled the prophecy addressed to Jehu (2Ki 10:30; also Ho 1:4), that his family would possess the throne of Israel for four generations; and accordingly Jehoahaz, Joash, Jehoram, and Zechariah were his successors&#8212;but there his dynasty terminated; and perhaps it was the public knowledge of this prediction that prompted the murderous design of Shallum.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The thirty and eighth year of Azariah; </span> of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/2_kings/15-2.htm" title="Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem.

FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE JEHU. The writer has nothing to record of Zachariah but his murder by Shallum after a reign of six months. Vers. 8, 9, and 11 contain the usual formula. Ver. 10 gives the only event that needed record. Ver. 12 recalls to the reader's attention a previous passage, in which a prophecy had been mentioned, whereof Zachariah's reign was the fulfillment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah King of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria.</span> If Azariah began to reign in the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam (ver. 1), and Jeroboam died in his forty-first or forty-second year (<a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>), Zachariah must have ascended the throne in the fifteenth or sixteenth year of Azariah. Even if Azariah became king in the fifteenth of Jeroboam, as has been shown to be probable (see the comment on ver. 1), Zachariah's accession cannot have been earlier than Azariah's twenty-sixth year. An interregnum between the death of Jeroboam and the accession of Zachariah is not to be thought cf. <span class="cmt_word">Six months</span>. So also Josephus (see 'Ant.

Uzziah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done. For as the latter was unfaithful to the Lord in the closing years of his reign, so did Uzziah seek God only so long as Zechariah, who was experienced in divine visions, remained alive, and God gave success to his enterprises, so that during this time he carried on successful wars against the Philistines and Arabians, fortified the walls of Jerusalem with strong towers, built watch-towers in the desert, and constructed cisterns for the protection and supply of his numerous flocks, promoted agriculture and vine-growing, and organized a numerous and well-furnished army (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5-15</a>). But the great power to which he thereby attained produced such haughtiness, that he wanted to make himself high priest in his kingdom after the manner of the heathen kings, and usurping the sacred functions, which belonged according to the law to the Levitical priests alone, to offer incense in the temple, for which he was punished with leprosy upon the spot (<a href="/2_kings/15-5.htm">2 Kings 15:5</a> compared with <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>.). The king's leprosy is described in our account also as a punishment from God. &#1497;&#1497; &#1493;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1506;: Jehovah smote him, and he became leprous. This presupposes an act of guilt, and confirms the fuller account of this guilt given in the Chronicles, which Thenius, following the example of De Wette and Winer, could only call in question on the erroneous assumption "that the powerful king wanted to restore the regal high-priesthood exercised by David and Solomon" Oehler (Herzog's Cycl.) has already shown that such an opinion is perfectly "groundless," since it is nowhere stated that David and Solomon performed with their own hands the functions assigned in the law to the priests in connection with the offering of sacrifice, as the co-operation of the priests is not precluded in connection with the sacrifices presented by these kings (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>, etc.). - Uzziah being afflicted with leprosy, was obliged to live in a separate house, and appoint his son Jotham as president of the royal house to judge the people, i.e., to conduct the administration of the kingdom. - The time when this event occurred is not stated either in our account or in the Chronicles. But this punishment from God cannot have fallen upon him before the last ten years of his fifty-two years' reign, because his son, who was only twenty-five years old when his father died (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-33.htm">2 Kings 15:33</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/27-1.htm">2 Chronicles 27:1</a>), undertook the administration of the affairs of the kingdom at once, and therefore must have been at least fifteen years old. &#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is taken by Winer, Gesenius, and others, after the example of Iken, to signify nosocomium, an infirmary or lazar-house, in accordance with the verb Arab. xfs&#774;, fecit, II debilis, imbecillis fuit. But this meaning cannot be traced in Hebrew, where &#1495;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is used in no other sense than free, set at liberty, manumissus. Consequently the rendering adopted by Aquila is correct, &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;; and the explanation given by Kimchi of this epithet is, that the persons who lived there were those who were sent away from human society, or perhaps more correctly, those who were released from the world and its privileges and duties, or cut off from intercourse with God and man.</body></html>
