Into this league they were anxious that Judaea should enter; but they distrusted the house of David, which had been so long hostile both to Damascus and to Samaria. They consequently formed the design of transferring the Jewish crown to a certain Ben-Tabeal <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-6.htm">Isaiah 7:6</a>, probably a Jewish noble, perhaps a refugee at one of their courts, whom they could trust to join heartily in their schemes (<a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37. the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, &c.&#8212;This is the first intimation of the hostile feelings of the kings of Israel and Syria, to Judah, which led them to form an alliance and make joint preparations for war.

Ahaz, "possession," is a name never assigned to any other Israelite, and it is one not likely to have been given by a religious father like Jotham. In the Assyrian inscriptions the Jewish king contemporary with Rezin and Pekah is called "Yahu-khazi." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jotham of Judah (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-1.htm">2 Chronicles 27:1-9</a>). - <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32</a>. "In the second year of Pekah Jotham began to reign." This agrees with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-27.htm">2 Kings 15:27</a>, that Pekah became king in the last year of Uzziah, supposing that it occurred at the commencement of the year. Jotham's sixteen years therefore came to a close in the seventeenth year of Pekah's reign (<a href="/2_kings/16-1.htm">2 Kings 16:1</a>). His reign was like that of his father Uzziah (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>, <a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-3.htm">2 Kings 15:3</a>, <a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>), except, as is added in Chr. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>, that he did not force himself into the temple of the Lord, as Uzziah had done (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). All that is mentioned of his enterprises in the account before us is that he built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, that is to say, that he restored it, or perhaps added to its beauty. The upper gate, according to <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a> compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-3.htm">2 Kings 8:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-5.htm">2 Kings 8:5</a>,<a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm">2 Kings 8:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>, is the gate at the north side of the inner or upper court, where all the sacrifices were slaughtered, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38-43</a>. We also find from <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>. that he built against the wall of Ophel, and several cities in the mountains of Judah, and castles and towers in the forests, and subdued the Ammonites, so that they paid him tribute for three years. Jotham carried on with great vigour, therefore, the work which his father had began, to increase the material prosperity of his subjects. </body></html>
