In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam&#8212;It is thought that the throne of Judah continued vacant eleven or twelve years, between the death of Amaziah and the inauguration of his son Azariah. Being a child only four years old when his father was murdered, a regency was appointed during Azariah's minority.<p>began Azariah &#8230; to reign&#8212;The character of his reign is described by the brief formula employed by the inspired historian, in recording the religious policy of the later kings. But his reign was a very active as well as eventful one, and is fully related (2Ch 26:1-23). Elated by the possession of great power, and presumptuously arrogating to himself, as did the heathen kings, the functions both of the real and sacerdotal offices, he was punished with leprosy, which, as the offense was capital (Nu 8:7), was equivalent to death, for this disease excluded him from all society. While Jotham, his son, as his viceroy, administered the affairs of the kingdom&#8212;being about fifteen years of age (compare 2Ki 15:33)&#8212;he had to dwell in a place apart by himself (see on [342]2Ki 7:3). After a long reign he died, and was buried in the royal burying-field, though not in the royal cemetery of "the city of David" (2Ch 26:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Save that; </span> understand this as <span class="ital">howbeit</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm" title="However, the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.">2 Kings 14:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Save that the high places were not removed,....

The Chronicler at this point supplies us with many particulars of Azariah’s history unnoticed in Kings. Azariah, he says, ‘sought God in the days of Zechariah’, a prophet, who appears to have been, the king’s counsellor. He made war with success upon the Philistines, the Arabians and the Mehunim. The Ammonites became tributary to him, and he fortified Jerusalem. He built many towers, and digged many wells, had much cattle and many labourers in husbandry, ‘for he loved husbandry’. He had also a large and well-ordered army of more than three hundred thousand men, and at their head were two thousand six hundred mighty men of valour. The king provided largely for their equipment with both defensive and offensive armour, and he also contrived many cunning engines of war, so that ‘his name spread far abroad, for he was marvellously helped till he was strong’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The higher ground for this strengthening of Israel in the time of Jeroboam was to be found in the compassion of God.
