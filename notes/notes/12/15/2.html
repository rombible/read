In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam&#8212;It is thought that the throne of Judah continued vacant eleven or twelve years, between the death of Amaziah and the inauguration of his son Azariah.

But his reign was a very active as well as eventful one, and is fully related (2Ch 26:1-23). Elated by the possession of great power, and presumptuously arrogating to himself, as did the heathen kings, the functions both of the real and sacerdotal offices, he was punished with leprosy, which, as the offense was capital (Nu 8:7), was equivalent to death, for this disease excluded him from all society. While Jotham, his son, as his viceroy, administered the affairs of the kingdom&#8212;being about fifteen years of age (compare 2Ki 15:33)&#8212;he had to dwell in a place apart by himself (see on [342]2Ki 7:3). After a long reign he died, and was buried in the royal burying-field, though not in the royal cemetery of "the city of David" (2Ch 26:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Besides the sixteen years of his minority last mentioned. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign,....
