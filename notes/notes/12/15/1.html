(B.C. 745-727). The most important statement runs: “19 districts of the city of Hamath (<span class= "ital">Hammatti</span>) with the cities of their circuit, on the coast of the sea of the setting of the sun (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the Mediterranean), which in their transgression had revolted to Azariah, to the border of Assyria I restored, my prefects my governors over them I appointed.” The Eponym list records a three years’ campaign of Tiglath Pileser against the Syrian state of Arpad in B.C. 742-740. Schrader supposes that Azariah and Hamath were concerned in this campaign. (This conflicts with the ordinary chronology, which fixes 758 B.C. as the year of Azariah’s death.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_kings/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/15-1.htm" title="In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.">2 Kings 15:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam — </span>After an interregnum of twelve years in the kingdom of Judah, either through the prevalency of the faction which cut off Amaziah the father, and kept the son out of his kingdom; or, rather, because Azariah was very young, it is thought only four years of age, when his father was slain, and the people were not agreed to restore him till he was in his sixteenth year: see on <a href="/2_kings/14-21.htm" title="And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.">2 Kings 14:21</a>. <span class="ital">Began Azariah to reign — </span>Solely and fully to exercise his regal power.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-7 Uzziah did for the most part that which was right.

But his reign was a very active as well as eventful one, and is fully related (2Ch 26:1-23). Elated by the possession of great power, and presumptuously arrogating to himself, as did the heathen kings, the functions both of the real and sacerdotal offices, he was punished with leprosy, which, as the offense was capital (Nu 8:7), was equivalent to death, for this disease excluded him from all society. While Jotham, his son, as his viceroy, administered the affairs of the kingdom&#8212;being about fifteen years of age (compare 2Ki 15:33)&#8212;he had to dwell in a place apart by himself (see on [342]2Ki 7:3).

Now Amaziah lived only to the fifteenth year of Jeroboam, <a href="/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2</a> in which year, and not in his twenty seventh, it might be thought Azariah his son began to reign. There are various ways taken to remove this difficulty, not to take notice of a corruption of numbers, "twenty seven for seventeen", which some insist on. Ben Gersom and Abarbinel are of opinion, that those twenty seven years of Jeroboam's reign are not to be understood of what were past, but of what were to come before the family of Jehu was extinct; and that he reigned twenty six years, and his son six months, which made twenty seven imperfect years. Others suppose that Jeroboam reigned with his father eleven or twelve years before his death; and, reckoning from the different periods of his reign, this was either the twenty seventh year, or the fifteenth or sixteenth: and others, that the reign of Azariah may be differently reckoned, either from the time his father fled to Lachish, where he might remain eleven or twelve years, or from his death, and so may be said to begin to reign either in the fifteenth or twenty seventh of Jeroboam; or there was an interregnum of eleven or twelve years after the death of his father, he being a minor of about four years of age, which was the fifteenth of Jeroboam, during which time the government was in the hands of the princes and great men of the nation; and it was not till Azariah was sixteen years of age, and when it was the twenty seventh of Jeroboam's reign, that the people agreed to make him king, see <a href="/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a> and which seems to be the best way of accounting for it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/context/2_kings/15-1.htm" title="In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign....">2 Kings 15:1-7</a>.

In <a href="/2_kings/14-1.htm" title="In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.">2 Kings 14:1</a> it is said that Amaziah the father of Azariah began to reign in the second year of Joash king of Israel. Now Joash (<a href="/2_kings/13-10.htm" title="In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.">2 Kings 13:10</a>) reigned sixteen years. Therefore he lived fourteen years contemporary with Amaziah. And the latter lived (<a href="/2_kings/14-17.htm" title="And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.">2 Kings 14:17</a>) after Joash’s death fifteen years more. Hence his whole reign was twenty-nine years. Again in the fifteenth year of Amaziah, Jeroboam II. began to reign (<a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm" title="In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.">2 Kings 14:23</a>). Hence Amaziah must have died and Azariah ascended the throne of Judah in the fourteenth or fifteenth year of Jeroboam, and not in the twenty-seventh as here stated. The explanation given in the margin of A.V. that the twenty-seven years are made up of the time when Jeroboam reigned alone, and several years in which he was consort with his father in the kingdom while Joash was engaged in the Syrian wars has nothing in Scripture to warrant it. Nor does it seem to have been the custom for a king to make his son partner in the sovereignty. If in any case such a plan had been resorted to, it would surely have been adopted when this king Azariah became a leper. But while it is expressly stated, in verse 5 below, that the king’s son Jotham was set over the household and judged the people of the land, there is no mention of a co-regency. The numbers in the verse before us present a difficulty which has not yet been solved.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Azariah</span>] In verses 13, 30, 32 and 34 of this chapter called <span class="ital">Uzziah</span>.

Either, therefore, Azariah must have begun to reign in the fifteenth year of Jeroboam, or there must have been an interregnum of twelve years between the death of Amaziah and the accession of Azariah. As this last hypothesis is pre-eluded by the narrative of <a href="/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a> and <a href="/2_kings/14-20.htm">2 Kings 14:20, 21</a>, we must correct the, twenty-seventh year" of this verse into the "fifteenth."
