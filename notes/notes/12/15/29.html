According to the Assyrian Dr. he reigned from 745 B.C. to 727 B.C.; and the monuments show us this energetic and powerful prince (though, probably, an usurper), building and repairing palaces, levying armies, and carrying on successful wars against Merodach-Baladan in Babylonia, Rezin at Damascus, Hiram at; Tyre, the Medes, the Armenians, the natives of Northern Mesopotamia, and the Arabs who bordered upon Egypt. His Assyrian name, Tiglat-pal-zira, is composed of the elements tiglat, "adoration," pal, "son," and zira, a word of uncertain meaning.<p>Ijon and Abel-beth-maachah - On the position of some of the towns mentioned in this verse see the marginal reference and <a href="/joshua/19-36.htm">Joshua 19:36</a>.

For some of the facts connected with his history see note on verse 19 above. According to the Assyrian canon Tiglath-pileser reigned 18 years, from b.c. 745 to b.c. 727, and the conquests mentioned in this verse are supposed to have been made in b.c. 734.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ijon</span>] In the north of Palestine, in the tribe of Naphtali. It has been mentioned previously (<a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm" title="So Benhadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.">1 Kings 15:20</a>) as ravaged by Benhadad’s captains. The towns here enumerated were exposed to the first attack of any enemy from the north.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Abel-beth-maachah</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">maacah</span>. This city like Ijon lay in the extreme north of Israel, and was also plundered by Benhadad’s officers. It is spoken of as ‘a city and a mother in Israel’ (<a href="/2_samuel/20-19.htm" title="I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?">2 Samuel 20:19</a>). It is elsewhere called <span class="ital">Abel-maim</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Janoah</span>] This place is mentioned nowhere else, and its site has not been determined. But, from the connexion in which it here occurs, it must have been situate in the northern part of the tribe of Naphtali.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Kedesh</span>] This town was one of the cities of refuge, and situate in the tribe of Naphtali. Hence it is called Kedesh-Naphtali (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm" title="And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?">Jdg 4:6</a>). Here Barak lived, and in later times (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/11-63.htm" title="Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country,">1Ma 11:63</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/11-73.htm" title="Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned again unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even unto their own tents, and there they camped.">1Ma 11:73</a>) it is mentioned as the scene of a battle between Jonathan Maccabæus and the troops of Demetrius. The name indicates that from the first it was a ‘holy’ place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Hazor</span>] Another fortified city of the tribe of Naphtali. It stood on the high ground overlooking Lake Merom. It was a very important place before the Israelites entered Canaan (<a href="/joshua/11-10.htm" title="And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.">Joshua 11:10</a>). Jabin was the king thereof whose general Sisera was defeated by Deborah and Barak (<a href="/judges/4-2.htm" title="And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.">Jdg 4:2</a>; <a href="/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Jdg 4:17</a>). It was strengthened by Solomon for the defence of his kingdom on the north (see <a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1 Kings 9:15</a>, note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Gilead</span>] The mountainous country on the east of the Jordan, extending from Bashan on the north to Moab and Ammon on the south.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Galilee</span>] This name, though afterwards given to a wide district, was at first only applied to a portion of the country round about Kedesh-Naphtali. In it were the twenty cities which Solomon gave to Hiram king of Tyre, for helping him in his building of the temple, and his own house (<a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm" title="(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.">1 Kings 9:11</a>). In the verse before us Galilee must refer only to the northern part of the district afterwards so named.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the land of Naphtali</span>] We can see, from this addition, where the ravages of Tiglath-pileser were made. He came into the northern portion of Israel on the west of Jordan, and on the east of the river overran a larger district, which from its mountainous character was more sparsely populated and so more easily reduced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">carried them captive to Assyria</span>] This event is placed from the evidence of the Assyrian inscriptions in b.c. 734. To carry away great numbers of the population of a conquered district and settle them elsewhere was frequent with the Assyrian monarchs.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Pekah Feng of Israel came Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria.</span> Tiglath-pileser's records are not in the shape of annals, and are, moreover, in a very mutilated condition. He does not date events, like most Assyrian kings, by his regal years. His first expedition into Syria is thought, however, to have been in his third year,  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>, but there is no evidence that, on this occasion, he proceeded further south than Damascus, where he took tribute from Rezin. Some years after this -  <span class="date">B.C. 738</span>, according to Mr. G. Smith - he penetrated to Palestine, where his chief enemy was Azariah King of Judah, who had united under his sway most of the tribes as far as Hamath. After chastising Azariah, he extended his dominion over most of the neighboring states and kingdoms; and it was at this time that (as related in ver. 19) he took tribute from Menahem. Subsequently (about  <span class="date">B.C. 734</span>) he made an expedition for the purpose of conquest, which receives very scant notice, in one inscription only. This is probably the expedition of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">And took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah.</span> These were places in the extreme north of the Israelite territory, in the vicinity of the Lake Merem, such as would naturally be among the first to fall before an Assyrian invader (on their exact position, see the comment on 1 Kings 15:20). <span class="cmt_word">And Janoah.</span> Janoah is now generally regarded as identical with the modern <span class="accented">Hunin</span>, a village close by "an ancient fortress of great strength" (Robinson, 'Later Researches,' p. 371), in the hill country northwest of Merom. It is in a direct line between Abel-beth-maa-chah (<span class="accented">Abil</span>) and Kedesh (<span class="accented">Cades</span>), as we should expect from the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">And Kedesh, and Hazor</span>. Kedesh is beyond all doubt the "Kedes" or "Cades," of today - an important site in the same mountain district, rather more than six miles south of Hunin, and four from the "waters of Merom" (see Robinson, 'Later Researches,' pp. 366, 367). Hazer was in the near neighborhood of Kedesh, towards the south probably. The exact position is disputed. Robinson's arguments in favor of El-Khu reibch are weighty; but the engineers employed by the Palestine Exploration Fund regard Khurbat-Harrah, between Kedesh and the Lake Merom, as a still more probable situation. <span class="cmt_word">And Gilead.</span> "Gilead," in this connection, can scarcely be "the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan" (Keil, Bahr) - the territory of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh, not of Naphtali. It is more likely to be a small district near Merom, perhaps the eastern coast of the lake (Gesenius), which was afterwards a part of Gaulouitis. The LXX., instead of <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3b4;</span>, have <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And Galilee</span>; Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 9:11, p. 190). The inscription of Tiglath-pileser, which appears to allude to this expedition, mentions "Galhi," and "Abel" (probably Abel-beth-maachah) as conquered at this time, and "added to Assyria." The places were, it says, on the border of the land of Beth-Omri (Samaria) (see the 'Eponym Canon,' p. 123, lines 6, 7). <span class="cmt_word">And carried them captive to Assyria.</span> Deportation of captives was largely practiced by Tiglath-pileser, as appears from the 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 118-120, and 122. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Pekahiah. - Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign "in the fiftieth year of Uzziah." As Menahem had begun to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah and reigned ten years, he must have died in the forty-ninth year of Uzziah; and therefore, if his son did not become king till the fiftieth year, some months must have elapsed between the death of Menahem and Pekahiah's ascent of the throne, probably cause, in the existing disorganization of the kingdom, the possession of the throne by the latter was opposed. Pekahiah reigned in the spirit of his predecessors, but only for two years, as his aide-de-camp (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, see at <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>) Pekah conspired against him and slew him in the citadel (&#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, see at <a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8</a>) of the king's palace, with Argob and Aryeh. Argob and Aryeh were not fellow-conspirators of Pekah, who helped to slay the king, but principes Pekachijae, as Seb. Schmidt expresses it, probably aides-de-camp of Pekahiah, who were slain by the conspirators when defending their king. We must take the words in this sense on account of what follows: &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, "and with him (Pekah) were fifty men of the Gileadites" (i.e., they helped him). The Gileadites probably belonged to the king's body-guard, and were under the command of the aides-de-camp of Pekah. </body></html>
