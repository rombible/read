As Menahem had begun to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah and reigned ten years, he must have died in the forty-ninth year of Uzziah; and therefore, if his son did not become king till the fiftieth year, some months must have elapsed between the death of Menahem and Pekahiah's ascent of the throne, probably cause, in the existing disorganization of the kingdom, the possession of the throne by the latter was opposed. Pekahiah reigned in the spirit of his predecessors, but only for two years, as his aide-de-camp (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, see at <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>) Pekah conspired against him and slew him in the citadel (&#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, see at <a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8</a>) of the king's palace, with Argob and Aryeh. Argob and Aryeh were not fellow-conspirators of Pekah, who helped to slay the king, but principes Pekachijae, as Seb. Schmidt expresses it, probably aides-de-camp of Pekahiah, who were slain by the conspirators when defending their king. We must take the words in this sense on account of what follows: &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1495;&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, "and with him (Pekah) were fifty men of the Gileadites" (i.e., they helped him). The Gileadites probably belonged to the king's body-guard, and were under the command of the aides-de-camp of Pekah. </body></html>
