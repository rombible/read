It was no long time since Jeroboam II. had recovered it for Israel. According to Schrader (<span class= "ital">K.A.T.,</span> pp. 254, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) the reference of the verse is to Tiglath Pileser’s expedition in B.C. 734, called in the Eponym list an expedition to the land of <span class= "ital">Pilista</span> (Philistia). With this Schrader connects a fragment of the annals which begins with a list of towns conquered by Tiglath, and ends thus: . . . “the town of Gaal (ad) . . . (A) bil . . . of the upper part of the land of Beth-Omri (i.e., Samaria) . . . in its whole extent I annexed to the territory of Assyria; my prefects the sagans I appointed over them.” The fragment goes on to mention the flight of Hânûn, king of Gaza, to Egypt, and the carrying off of his goods and his gods by the conqueror. It is added, “The land of Beth-Omri . . . the whole body of his men, their goods, to the land of Assyria I led away, <span class= "ital">Pakaha </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Pekah) their king I <span class= "ital">slew</span> (so Schrader;? ‘they slew’), and <span class= "ital">A-u-si-ha </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Hoshea) . . . over them I appointed.

The brief record of Kmgs does not mention this; but <a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm" title="Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.">2Kings 17:3</a> represents Hoshea as paying tribute to Shalmaneser IV., the successor of Tiglath.<p><span class= "bld">In the twentieth year of Jotham.</span>—This is a suspicious statement, as not agreeing with <a href="/2_kings/15-33.htm" title="Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

Pekah, however, reigned much longer than any of the preceding four. For though he also, like Shallum and Menahem, got the kingdom by treason and blood, he kept possession of it twenty years. So long it was before his violent dealing returned upon his own head. And he made himself more noted abroad than any of these usurpers; for even in the latter part of his time, in the reign of Ahaz, (which began in his seventeenth year,) he was a great terror to the kingdom of Judah, as we find, <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.">Isaiah 7:1</a>.

The writer is again exceedingly brief. Pekah's reign was a remarkable one, and might have furnished much material to the historian. In conjunction with Rezin of Damascus, he made war upon Judaea, defeated Ahaz with great loss (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>), and laid siege to Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>). Ahaz called in the aid or' Assyria, and Tiglath-pileser made two expeditions into Palestine - the one mentioned in ver. 29, and another some years afterwards. In the latter he seems to have had the assistance of Hoshea, who, with his sanction, slew Pekah, and became king. The scanty notices of our author must be supplemented from <a href="/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-8</a>; and the Assyrian inscriptions. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah King of Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the thirty-ninth or thirty-eighth year</span> (see the comment on ver. 23). Pekahiah's "two years" may not have been complete. <span class="cmt_word">Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.</span> The Assyrian records make this number impossible. Tiglath-pileser's entire reign lasted only eighteen years, yet it more than covered the entire reign of Pekah. When he first invaded the kingdom of Samaria, Menahem was upon the throne ('Eponym Canon,' p. 120, line 29); when he last attacked it, probably in  <span class="date">B.C. 730</span> - two years before his death in  <span class="date">B.C. 728</span> - he set up Hoshea, or, at any rate, sanctioned his usurpation (ibid., pp. 123, 124, lines 15-18). Pekah's entire reign must have come in the interval, which is certainly not more than one of fifteen, probably not more than one of ten years. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To collect the requisite amount, Menahem imposed upon all persons of property a tax of fifty shekels each. &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; with &#1506;&#1500;, he caused to arise, i.e., made a collection. &#1492;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; in a causative sense, from &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, to arise, to be paid (<a href="/2_kings/12-13.htm">2 Kings 12:13</a>). &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;: not warriors, but men of property, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2.htm">Ruth 2</a> Kings <a href="/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>. &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, for the individual. Pul was the first king of Assyria who invaded the kingdom of Israel and prepared the way for the conquest of this kingdom by his successors, and for the extension of the Assyrian power as far as Egypt. According to the thorough investigation made by Marc. v. Niebuhr (Gesch. Assurs u. Babels, pp. 128ff.), Pul, whose name has not yet been discovered upon the Assyrian monuments, was the last king of Nineveh of the family of the Derketades, who still ruled over Babylon according to Berosus, and the last king but one of this dynasty.<p>(Note: It is true that some trace of his expedition has been found in the monuments, since an inscription has been deciphered with tolerable certainty, stating that king Minikhimmi of Samirina (Menahem of Shomron or Samaria) paid tribute to an Assyrian king. But the name of this Assyrian king is not determined with certainty, as Rawlinson, and Oppert read it Tiglat-palassar, and suppose Tiglath-pileser to be intended; whereas M. v. Niebuhr (p. 132, note 1) imagines it to be the full name of Pul, since no Assyrian king ever had a name of one syllable like Pul as his official name, and even before that Hincks had detected in the name Minikhimmi the king Menahem who had to purchase the friendship of the Assyrian ruler Pul with 1000 talents of silver.
