Though Judah was not without troubles, yet that kingdom was happy, compared with the state of Israel. The imperfections of true believers are very different from the allowed wickedness of ungodly men. Such is human nature, such are our hearts, if left to themselves, deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.

Probably Pekah occupied some such position about the king, which gave him the opportunity of attacking his master, for the murder was perpetrated ‘in the castle of the king’s house’. From the mention of the fifty men of the Gileadites who took part with him in the conspiracy, it has been conjectured that Pekah was himself a native of that wild land, the home in former days of Jephthah and of Elijah. His conduct is of the kind to be expected from one nursed in such wild localities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the palace</span> [R.V. <span class="bld">castle</span>] <span class="ital">of the king’s house</span>] The word is rendered ‘palace’ everywhere in A.V. except <a href="/proverbs/18-19.htm" title="A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.">Proverbs 18:19</a> ‘like the bars of a <span class="ital">castle</span>’.

Hence the change in R.V. We know so little of the construction of the royal houses of Israel that it is difficult to be precise about what is meant.

"The Four Hundred" were probably the royal body-guard, which at this time may have consisted of Gileadites. <span class="cmt_word">And he killed him, and reigned in his room.</span> It does not appear that Pekah had any grievance. His crime seems to have been simply prompted by ambition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the time of Menahem, Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and Menahem gave him 1000 talents of silver - more than two and a half millions of thalers (375,000) - "that his hands might be with him, to confirm the kingdom in his hand." These words are understood by the majority of commentators from the time of Ephraem Syrus, when taken in connection with <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>, as signifying that Menahem invited Pul, that he might establish his government with his assistance. But the words of Hosea, "Ephraim goes to the Assyrian," sc. to seek for help (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13</a>, cf. <a href="/2_kings/7-11.htm">2 Kings 7:11</a> and <a href="/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>), are far too general to be taken as referring specially to Menahem; and the assumption that Menahem invited Pul into the land is opposed by the words in the verse before us, "Pul came over the land." Even the further statement that Menahem gave to Pul 1000 talents of silver when he came into the land, that he might help him to establish his government, presupposes at the most that a party opposed to Menahem had invited the Assyrians, to overthrow the usurper. At any rate, we may imagine, in perfect harmony with the words of our account, that Pul marched against Israel of his own accord, possibly induced to do so by Menahem's expedition against Thapsacus, and that his coming was simply turned to account as a good opportunity for disputing Menahem's possession of the throne he had usurped, so that Menahem, by paying the tribute mentioned, persuaded the Assyrian to withdraw, that he might deprive the opposing party of the Assyrian support, and thereby establish his own rule. </body></html>
