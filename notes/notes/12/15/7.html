In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam&#8212;It is thought that the throne of Judah continued vacant eleven or twelve years, between the death of Amaziah and the inauguration of his son Azariah.

But his reign was a very active as well as eventful one, and is fully related (2Ch 26:1-23). Elated by the possession of great power, and presumptuously arrogating to himself, as did the heathen kings, the functions both of the real and sacerdotal offices, he was punished with leprosy, which, as the offense was capital (Nu 8:7), was equivalent to death, for this disease excluded him from all society. While Jotham, his son, as his viceroy, administered the affairs of the kingdom&#8212;being about fifteen years of age (compare 2Ki 15:33)&#8212;he had to dwell in a place apart by himself (see on [342]2Ki 7:3). After a long reign he died, and was buried in the royal burying-field, though not in the royal cemetery of "the city of David" (2Ch 26:23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Azariah slept with his fathers,....

Benjamin of Tudela (p) places his grave near the pillar of Absalom, and the fountain of Siloah, near the brook Kidron: <p>and Jotham his son reigned in his stead; who reigned sixteen years; a further account of him, and his reign, we have in the latter part of this chapter, after the reigns of several of the kings of Israel. <p>(p) Itinerar. p. 43. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David</span>] His body, as appears from 2 Chron., was not laid with the rest of the kings in the royal sepulchre, but apparently in the same piece of land. ‘They buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings: for they said; He is a leper’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jotham his son reigned</span>] We can scarcely suppose that this notice would have been thus set down in the ordinary formula after Azariah’s death, if Jotham had been joint ruler all the time of his father’s leprosy. The smiting of the king must have been in the latter part of his reign. The conquests, buildings, agriculture, and military organization described by the Chronicler (see above on verse 4) must have needed many years to bring to the perfection they attained. Therefore, though Azariah’s reign was fifty-two years long, we need not think of him as a leper for more than the last ten years. As Jotham succeeded his father at twenty-five he would only have been fifteen when he was placed over the household. This may perhaps make ten years appear too long a time to assign to his father’s leprosy.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David.</span> Here again the writer of Chronicles is more exact. Azariah, he tells us (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-23.htm">2 Chronicles 26:23</a>), was not buried in the rock-sepulcher which contained the bodies of the other kings, but in another part of the field wherein the sepulcher was situated. This was quite consonant with Jewish feeling with respect to the uncleanness of the leper. <span class="cmt_word">And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</span> Jotham, already for some years prince regent, became king as a matter of course on his father's demise. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Azariah (Uzziah) or Judah (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>). - The statement that "in the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam Azariah began to reign" is at variance with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/14-16.htm">2 Kings 14:16-17</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>.
