The “innocent blood” shed by Manasseh was that of the prophets of Jehovah and their followers. “As the nation fell back into the grooves of its old existence, ancient customs began to reassert their sway. The worship which the prophets condemned, and which Hezekiah had proscribed, was too deeply interwoven with all parts of life to be uprooted by royal decree, and the old prejudice of the country folk against the capital, so clearly apparent in (the pages of the prophet) Micah, must have co-operated with superstition to bring about the strong revulsion against the new reforms which took place under Hezekiah’s son, Manasseh. A bloody struggle ensued between the conservative party and the followers of the prophets, and the new king was on the side of the reaction (<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Talmudic tradition relates that Isaiah himself was sawn asunder in the trunk of a cedar tree in which he had taken refuge.

The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1-4</a>.

It is singular that the Chronicler makes no special mention of this particular offence. Josephus on the contrary (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> x. 3, 1) says ‘He did not even spare the prophets, but even of these he slew some daily (<span class="greekheb">καθ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἡμέραν</span>) so that Jerusalem ran with blood’. The tradition that Isaiah himself was one of the sufferers in this slaughter was current among early Christian legends, and some have taken the mention of ‘sawing asunder’ (<a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>) as an allusion to his fate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from one end to another</span>] Lit. ‘from mouth to mouth’.

Some culminating horror is required, something not touched upon before, and something specially attaching to the monarch himself. These conditions are answered by supposing a bloody persecution of the faithful to be intended. Josephus declares positively that Manasseh "cruelly put to death all the righteous among the Hebrews, and did not even spare the prophets" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:3. &sect; 1). A tradition, very widely received, declared Isaiah to have been one of the victims ('Gemara Jebam.,' 4:13; 'Sanhedr.,' f. 103; Tertullian, 'De Patientia,' &sect; 14; Augustine, 'De Cir. Dei,' 18:24, etc.). Stanley says, "A reign of terror commenced against all who ventured to resist the reaction. Day by day a fresh batch of the prophetic order were ordered for execution. It seemed as if a devouring lion were let loose against them. From end to end of Jerusalem were to be seen traces of their blood. The nobles who took their part were thrown headlong from the rocky cliffs of Jerusalem" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' pt. 2. p. 492). The persecution has been compared to that of Anglicans under Mary Tudor. <span class="cmt_word">Till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another</span>  <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> "till he had filled it with blood and slaughter" (comp. <a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord</span> (see ver. 9). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord therefore announced through the prophets, to the rebellious and idolatrous nation, the destruction of Jerusalem and the deliverance of Judah into the hands of its enemies; but, as is added in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-10.htm">2 Chronicles 33:10</a>, they paid no heed to them. The prophets who foretold this terrible judgment are not named. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-18.htm">2 Chronicles 33:18</a>, their utterances were entered in the annals of the kings. Habakkuk was probably one of them, since he (<a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>) predicted the Chaldaean judgment as a fact which excited astonishment and appeared incredible.
