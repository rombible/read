But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first step in the re-establishment of idolatry seems to have been the restoration of the high places where Yahweh was professedly worshipped <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-22.htm">2 Kings 18:22</a>, but with idolatrous rites <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. The next was to re-introduce the favorite idolatry of Israel, Baal-worship, which had formerly flourished in Judaea under Athaliah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>, and Ahaz <a href="/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>. After this, Manasseh seems to have especially affected Sabaism, which had been previously unknown in Judaea (compare <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a> and note).<p>Worshipped all the host of heaven - Sabaism, or pure star-worship, without images, and without astrological superstitions, included a reverence for the sun, the moon, the chief stars, and the twelve signs of the Zodiac (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a> note). The main worship was by altars, on which incense was burned <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>. These altars were placed either upon the ground <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>, or upon the house-tops <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>.

The star-worship of the Jews has far more the character of an Arabian than an Assyrian or Chaldaean cult. It obtained its hold at a time when Assyria and Babylonia had but little communication with Judaea - i. e., during the reign of Manasseh. It crept in probably from the same quarter as the Molech worship, with which it is here (and in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-6</a>) conjoined. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 21<p>2Ki 21:1-18. Manasseh's Wicked Reign, and Great Idolatry.<p>1-3. Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign&#8212;He must have been born three years after his father's recovery; and his minority, spent under the influence of guardians who were hostile to the religious principles and reforming policy of his father, may account in part for the anti-theocratic principles of his reign. The work of religious reformation which Hezekiah had zealously carried on was but partially accomplished. There was little appearance of its influence on the heart and manners of the people at large. On the contrary, the true fear of God had vanished from the mass of the people; corruption and vice increased, and were openly practised (Isa 28:7, &c.) by the degenerate leaders, who, having got the young prince Manasseh into their power, directed his education, trained him up in their views, and seduced him into the open patronage of idolatry. Hence, when he became sovereign, he introduced the worship of idols, the restoration of high places, and the erection of altars or pillars to Baal, and the placing, in the temple of God itself, a graven image of Asherah, the sacred or symbolic tree, which represented "all the host of heaven." This was not idolatry, but pure star-worship, of Chaldaic and Assyrian origin [Keil]. The sun, as among the Persians, had chariots and horses consecrated to it (2Ki 23:11); and incense was offered to the stars on the housetops (2Ki 23:12; 2Ch 33:5; Jer 19:13; Zep 1:5), and in the temple area with the face turned toward the sunrise (Eze 8:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The host of heaven; </span> the stars, which the Gentiles had transformed into gods. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deu 4:19</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed,....

It had, perhaps, been introduced among the Jews by Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). At any rate, it was from the time of Manasseh one of the favorite idolatries of the Jewish people. The stars were believed to guide the destiny of men, and astrology was cultivated as a main part, or even as the essence, of religion. Astrological tracts form an important element in the literature of the Babylonians (see' Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 153-163). The chief objects of adoration in this worship were the sun and moon, the five planets, and the signs of the zodiac. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The words, "of thy sons, which shall proceed from thee, which thou shalt beget," do not necessarily refer to the actual sons, but only to lineal descendants.
