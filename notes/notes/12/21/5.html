But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "altars" of this verse seem to be the same with those of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>, and consequently were not in the temple building, but in the outer and inner courts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. the two courts of the house of the Lord&#8212;the court of the priests, and the large court of the people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The one of the priests, the other of the people, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/6-36.htm" title="And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.">1 Kings 6:36</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he built altars for all the host of heaven,....

The outer court was for the people, the inner for the priests and Levites. Manasseh desecrated the temple to the extent of setting up in each of these two courts an idolatrous altar, dedicated to the worship of the host of heaven. In the inner court his altar was a rival to the great brazen altar of Solomon (1 Kings 9:64; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), which Ahaz had for a time removed from its place in front of the porch (<a href="/2_kings/16-14.htm">2 Kings 16:14</a>), but which Hezekiah had most certainly reinstated. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Close of Hezekiah's reign. - On the basin (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1495;) and the aqueduct constructed by him, see at <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>. </body></html>
