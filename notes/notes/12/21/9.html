But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations.

When such a king succeeds one of strict and rind principles, he easily carries away the multitude with him, and leads them on to any excess of profligacy and irreligion. The beginnings of sin are delightful, and the votaries of pleasure, readily beguiled into evil courses, know not where to stop. Manasseh seduced them, we are told, <span class="cmt_word">to do more evil than did the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel</span>; that is, than the Hivites, Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Gergashites, and Jebusites (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>, etc.). The sin of Israel exceeded that of the Canaanitish nations, not so much in any outward and tangible features, as in the fact that it was committed against light, in spite of the Law, and against all the warnings and denunciations of the prophets (comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13, 14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, "he built again" the high places, which Hezekiah had destroyed (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), erected altars for Baal and an Asherah, like Ahab of Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-32.htm">1 Kings 16:32-33</a>). &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; is the image of Asherah mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>, whereas in the Chronicles the thought is generalized by the plurals &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;. To these two kinds of idolatry, the idolatrous bamoth and the (true) Baal-and Asherah-worship, Manasseh added as a third kind the worship of all the host of heaven, which had not occurred among the Israelites before the Assyrian era, and was probably of Assyrian or Chaldaean origin. This worship differed from the Syrophoenician star-worship, in which sun and moon were worshipped under the names of Baal and Astarte as the bearers of the male and female powers of nature, and was pure star-worship, based upon the idea of the unchangeableness of the stars in contradistinction to the perishableness of everything earthly, according to which the stars were worshipped not merely as the originators of all rise and decay in nature, but also as the leaders and regulators of sublunary things (see Movers, Phniz. i. pp. 65 and 161). This star-worship was a later development of the primary star-worship of Ssabism, in which the stars were worshipped without any image, in the open air or upon the housetops, by simple contemplation, the oldest and comparatively the purest form of deification of nature, to which the earlier Arabians and the worshippers of the sun among the Ssabians (Zabians) were addicted (cf. Delitzsch on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26-27</a>), and which is mentioned and forbidden in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>. In this later form the sun had sacred chariots and horses as among the Persians (<a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>), and incense was offered to the stars, with the face turned towards the east, upon altars which were built either upon housetops, as in the case of the Nabataeans (Strabo, xvi. 784), or within the limits of the temple in the two courts (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, also <a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/33-5.htm">2 Chronicles 33:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). This burning of incense took place not merely to the sun and moon, but also to the signs of the zodiac and to all the host of heaven, i.e., to all the stars (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>); by which we are no doubt to understand that the sun, moon, planets and other stars, were worshipped in conjunction with the zodiac, and with this were connected astrology, augury, and the casting of nativities, as in the case of the later so-called Chaldaeans.<p>(Note: Movers (Phniz. i. p. 65) correctly observes, that "in all the books of the Old Testament which are written before the Assyrian period there is no trace of any (?) star-worship; not that the Phoenician (Canaanitish) gods had not also a sidereal significance, but because this element was only a subordinate one, and the expressions, sun, moon, and stars, and all the host of heaven, which are not met with before, become for the first time common now," - although his proofs of the difference between the Assyrian star-worship and the Phoenician and Babylonian image-worship stand greatly in need of critical sifting.)<p>This star-worship is more minutely described in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4</a>, <a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>.
