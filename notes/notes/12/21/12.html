The words used represent the city emptied and utterly desolate, yet not destroyed thereby, but cleansed, and to be kept for the future dwelling of the Jews: forsaken, yet not finally, and only as to outward privileges, for individual believers were preserved in that visitation. The Lord will cast off any professing people who dishonour him by their crimes, but never will desert his cause on earth. In the book of Chronicles we read of Manasseh's repentance, and acceptance with God; thus we may learn not to despair of the recovery of the greatest sinners. But let none dare to persist in sin, presuming that they may repent and reform when they please. There are a few instances of the conversion of notorious sinners, that none may despair; and but few, that none may presume.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophets - None of the prophets of this reign are certainly known.

In both these passages the phrase is used in connexion with utter overthrow, in the one, of Eli’s house, in the other, of Jerusalem.

"It denotes" (Keil) "such a judgment as has never been heard of before, and excites alarm and horror." Not the Jews only, but the other neighboring nations, when they heard of the sufferings endured in the siege (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>), and the severities exercised upon the king (ver. 7.) and the city (vers. 9, 10) and. the inhabitants (ver. 11), would have a thrill of pain go through them at the hearing, partly unselfish, partly perhaps selfish, since the treatment that was dealt out to others might also be reserved for them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He also offered his son in sacrifice to Moloch, like Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>), in the valley of Benhinnom (Chr. cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), and practised soothsaying and witchcraft of every kind.
