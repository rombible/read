But this his graceless son, on the contrary, made it his study to banish religion and morality out of the country, to revive the old idolatry, and to introduce new and unheard-of idols and ceremonies; besides witchcraft, sorceries, and every wicked custom that was used among the heathen far and near. Baal became now the favourite object of his worship: Moloch and the valley of Hinnom were now more frequented than ever; the impious king encouraging his impious subjects to sacrifice their children there, as Ahaz had done before. He did not, however, pass unpunished for these offences: but for the particulars of his punishment, which are not mentioned in this book, the reader must be referred to <a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm" title="Why the LORD brought on them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>, &c.

But this, for the most part, ruins their future comfort, and causes mischief to others. It is much happier when young persons are sheltered under the care of parents or guardians, till age gives experience and discretion. Though such young persons are less indulged, they will afterwards be thankful. Manasseh wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, as if on purpose to provoke him to anger; he did more evil than the nations whom the Lord destroyed. Manasseh went on from bad to worse, till carried captive to Babylon. The people were ready to comply with his wishes, to obtain his favour and because it suited their depraved inclinations. In the reformation of large bodies, numbers are mere time-servers, and in temptation fall away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Manasseh during his minority naturally fell under the influence of the chief Jewish nobles, with whom the pure religion of Yahweh was always unpopular (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1-2</a>). They seem to have persuaded him, not only to undo Hezekiah's work, but to proceed to lengths in polytheism, magic, and idolatry, unknown before. The sins of Manasseh's reign appear to have been those which filled up the measure of Judah's iniquity, and brought down the final sentence of doom on the last remnant of the chosen people (<a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>; compare <a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 21<p>2Ki 21:1-18. Manasseh's Wicked Reign, and Great Idolatry.<p>1-3. Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign&#8212;He must have been born three years after his father's recovery; and his minority, spent under the influence of guardians who were hostile to the religious principles and reforming policy of his father, may account in part for the anti-theocratic principles of his reign. The work of religious reformation which Hezekiah had zealously carried on was but partially accomplished. There was little appearance of its influence on the heart and manners of the people at large. On the contrary, the true fear of God had vanished from the mass of the people; corruption and vice increased, and were openly practised (Isa 28:7, &c.) by the degenerate leaders, who, having got the young prince Manasseh into their power, directed his education, trained him up in their views, and seduced him into the open patronage of idolatry. Hence, when he became sovereign, he introduced the worship of idols, the restoration of high places, and the erection of altars or pillars to Baal, and the placing, in the temple of God itself, a graven image of Asherah, the sacred or symbolic tree, which represented "all the host of heaven." This was not idolatry, but pure star-worship, of Chaldaic and Assyrian origin [Keil]. The sun, as among the Persians, had chariots and horses consecrated to it (2Ki 23:11); and incense was offered to the stars on the housetops (2Ki 23:12; 2Ch 33:5; Jer 19:13; Zep 1:5), and in the temple area with the face turned toward the sunrise (Eze 8:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; </span> partly by the instigation of the wicked princes of Judah, who in Hezekiah’s time were secret enemies to his reformation, and now, when their fetters were knocked off by Hezekiah’s death, break forth into open hostility against it, and corrupt the king’s tender years with their wicked counsel; and principally by his own vicious inclination. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,....

He probably fell under the influence of the "princes of Judah," who, supported by many of the priests, had maintained themselves as a party antagonistic to Isaiah during the whole of Hezekiah's reign. Hezekiah's reformation had been carried out against their wishes. They had always leant towards foreign alliances (<a href="/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>) and foreign rites (<a href="/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>). The accession of a boy-king would be joyfully hailed by them, and they would make every effort to draw him to their side.

The sin of vanity was to be punished by the carrying away of that of which his heart was proud. Isaiah did not go to Hezekiah by his own impulse, but by the direction of God. His inquiries: "What have these men said, and whence do they come to thee?" were simply intended to lead the king to give expression to the thoughts of his heart. In the answer, "From a distant land have they come, from Babel," his vanity at the great honour that had been paid him comes clearly to light.</body></html>
