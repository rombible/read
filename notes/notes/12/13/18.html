And if, added to this, we may suppose, with the generality of interpreters, that the prophet had apprized him beforehand that such was the symbolical intent of what he now put him upon, that the oftener he smote upon the ground, the more would be the victories which his arms should obtain; and that thus, in some measure, his success in the war was put into his own power; the king’s conduct was utterly inexcusable, if, diffident of the prophet’s promise, and considering the great strength of the kings of Syria, more than the power of God, he stopped his hand after he had smote thrice, supposing that the prediction would never have been fulfilled, had he gone on and smote upon the earth oftener. Upon the whole, therefore, the prophet had just reason to be offended at the king for not believing God, who had done so many signal miracles in favour of the Israelites; for not believing <span class="ital">him, </span>who, according to his own acknowledgment, had been a constant defender of the state, and now, in his dying hours, was full of good wishes and intentions for his country.

It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend the sick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour. Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God for direction and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but go on, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dying prophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more force than the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning the sign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dying prophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wish well, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantages against spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Smite upon the ground - Some prefer to render - "Shoot to the ground;" i. e.

Take bow and arrows&#8212;Hostilities were usually proclaimed by a herald, sometimes by a king or general making a public and formal discharge of an arrow into the enemy's country. Elisha directed Joash to do this, as a symbolical act, designed to intimate more fully and significantly the victories promised to the king of Israel over the Syrians. His laying his hands upon the king's hands was to represent the power imparted to the bow shot as coming from the Lord through the medium of the prophet. His shooting the first arrow eastward&#8212;to that part of his kingdom which the Syrians had taken and which was east of Samaria&#8212;was a declaration of war against them for the invasion. His shooting the other arrows into the ground was in token of the number of victories he was taken to gain; but his stopping at the third betrayed the weakness of his faith; for, as the discharged arrow signified a victory over the Syrians, it is evident that the more arrows he shot the more victories he would gain. As he stopped so soon, his conquests would be incomplete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Smite upon the ground:</span> the former sign portended victory, and this was to declare the number of the victories. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, take the arrows, and he took them,....

It appears as though the prophet wished blows to be aimed as if intended to strike down a foe. So the sense is equivalent to ‘strike (some one) down to the ground’. It does not seem that there was to be any shooting of the arrows in this second figurative action, but only a series of blows made with them as they were grasped, and aimed at some imaginary enemy who was to be brought down.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And he smote thrice, and stayed</span>] On ‘stayed’ in this sense of ‘ceased’ cf. on <a href="/2_kings/4-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel.

Keil and Bahr, on the contrary, think that the order was to shoot the arrows down from the window and hit the earth with them. But some contrast seems to be intended between the "shoot" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 19 and the "strike" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>) of the present passage. Ewald's explanation is thus to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">And he smote thrice, and stayed.</span> Joash struck with the arrows against the floor three times, and then paused, thinking he had done enough. He did not enter into the spirit of the symbolical act, which represented the smiting and slaying of enemies. Perhaps he had not much faith in the virtue of the symbolism, which he may even, with the arrogance of a proud and worldly minded man, have thought childish. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Jehoash or Joash of Israel. - On the commencement of his reign see at <a href="/2_kings/13-1.htm">2 Kings 13:1</a>.
