It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend the sick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour. Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God for direction and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but go on, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dying prophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more force than the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning the sign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dying prophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wish well, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantages against spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is that "he, the king of Syria" (<a href="/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a> Hazael) limited the standing army of Jehoahaz.<p>Like the dust by threshing - An expression not only employed metaphorically, and importing defeat, conquest, and grinding oppression <a href="/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>, but implying also the literal use of threshing-instruments in the execution of prisoners of war (marginal reference, and compare <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 13:8-25.

Our author seems to include both son and father in the same category (comp. ver. 2). The narrative contained in ver. 14 is probably the foundation of the historian's favorable judgment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this oppression Jehoahaz prayed to the Lord (&#1497;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>); and the Lord heard this prayer, because He saw their oppression at the hands of the Syrians, and gave Israel a saviour, so that they came out from the power of the Syrians and dwelt in their booths again, as before, i.e., were able to live peaceably again in their houses, without being driven off and led away by the foe. The saviour, &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;, was neither an angel, nor the prophet Elisha, nor quidam e ducibus Joasi, as some of the earlier commentators supposed, nor a victory obtained by Jehoahaz over the Syrians, nor merely Jeroboam (Thenius); but the Lord gave them the saviour in the two successors of Jehoahaz, in the kings Jehoash and Jeroboam, the former of whom wrested from the Syrians all the cities that had been conquered by them under his father (<a href="/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>), while the latter restored the ancient boundaries of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-22.htm">2 Kings 13:22-25</a>, the oppression by the Syrians lasted as long as Jehoahaz lived; but after his death the Lord had compassion upon Israel, and after the death of Hazael, when his son Benhadad had become king, Jehoash recovered from Benhadad all the Israelitish cities that had been taken by the Syrians. It is obvious from this, that the oppression which Benhadad the son of Hazael inflicted upon Israel, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>, falls within the period of his father's reign, so that it was not as king, but as commander-in-chief under his father, that he oppressed Israel, and therefore he is not even called king in <a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>.</body></html>
