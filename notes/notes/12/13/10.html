This difficulty, however, is solved by supposing, what is very probable, that Jehoahaz had made his son Jehoash king, jointly with himself, two or three years before his death. This is the more probable, because he was perpetually in a state of war, and consequently in danger of an untimely death; and because his son was a man of valour, as is implied, <a href="/2_kings/13-12.htm" title="And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2 Kings 13:12</a>, and declared, <a href="/context/2_chronicles/25-17.htm" title="Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face....">2 Chronicles 25:17-24</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:10-19 Jehoash, the king, came to Elisha, to receive his dying counsel and blessing. It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend the sick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour. Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God for direction and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but go on, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dying prophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more force than the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning the sign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dying prophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wish well, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantages against spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is that "he, the king of Syria" (<a href="/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4</a> Hazael) limited the standing army of Jehoahaz.<p>Like the dust by threshing - An expression not only employed metaphorically, and importing defeat, conquest, and grinding oppression <a href="/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>, but implying also the literal use of threshing-instruments in the execution of prisoners of war (marginal reference, and compare <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 13:8-25.

The writer passes from the reign of Jehoahaz, Jehu's son, to that of Joash, Jehu's grandson, which he seems to have intended at first to dispatch in the short space of four verses (vers. 10-13). He afterwards, however, saw reason to add to his narrative, first, an account of an interview between Joash and Elisha, shortly Before the death of the latter (vers. 14-19); secondly, an account of a miracle wrought soon afterwards by means of Elisha's corpse (vers. 20, 21); and thirdly, a brief notice of Joash's Syrian war (vers. 22-25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the thirty and seventh year of Joash King of Judah.</span> Three years before his death, since he reigned forty years  (<a href="/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>).

The saviour, &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506;, was neither an angel, nor the prophet Elisha, nor quidam e ducibus Joasi, as some of the earlier commentators supposed, nor a victory obtained by Jehoahaz over the Syrians, nor merely Jeroboam (Thenius); but the Lord gave them the saviour in the two successors of Jehoahaz, in the kings Jehoash and Jeroboam, the former of whom wrested from the Syrians all the cities that had been conquered by them under his father (<a href="/2_kings/13-25.htm">2 Kings 13:25</a>), while the latter restored the ancient boundaries of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). According to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-22.htm">2 Kings 13:22-25</a>, the oppression by the Syrians lasted as long as Jehoahaz lived; but after his death the Lord had compassion upon Israel, and after the death of Hazael, when his son Benhadad had become king, Jehoash recovered from Benhadad all the Israelitish cities that had been taken by the Syrians. It is obvious from this, that the oppression which Benhadad the son of Hazael inflicted upon Israel, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>, falls within the period of his father's reign, so that it was not as king, but as commander-in-chief under his father, that he oppressed Israel, and therefore he is not even called king in <a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>.</body></html>
