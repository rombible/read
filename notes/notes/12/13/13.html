It may turn much to our spiritual advantage, to attend the sick-beds and death-beds of good men, that we may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have from it in a dying hour. Elisha assured the king of his success; yet he must look up to God for direction and strength; must reckon his own hands not enough, but go on, in dependence upon Divine aid. The trembling hands of the dying prophet, as they signified the power of God, gave this arrow more force than the hands of the king in his full strength. By contemning the sign, the king lost the thing signified, to the grief of the dying prophet. It is a trouble to good men, to see those to whom they wish well, forsake their own mercies, and to see them lose advantages against spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to ordinary laws of historical composition, these verses should form the closing paragraph of the present chapter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah&#8212;(See on [340]2Ki 14:8-14).

The name means, "he whose people is many," and was thus anticipative of that great enlargement of the Israelite kingdom, which took place under him (see <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel</span> (see the comment on ver. 9). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;) he had not left," etc., furnishes the ground for <a href="/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a> : God gave them a saviour, ... although they did not desist from the sin of Jeroboam, ... for Israel had been brought to the last extremity; He (Jehovah) had left to Jehoahaz people (&#1506;&#1501;, people of war), only fifty horsemen, etc. For &#1492;&#1495;&#1496;&#1497; instead of &#1492;&#1495;&#1496;&#1497;&#1488; (<a href="/2_kings/13-6.htm">2 Kings 13:6</a>), see at <a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>.
