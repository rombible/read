Elijah was honoured <span class="ital">in </span>his departure; Elisha <span class="ital">after </span>his departure. Thus God dispenses honours as he pleases. 2d, To seal and confirm his doctrine and prophecies, and thereby confute the false doctrine and worship of the Israelites. 3d, To strengthen the faith of Joash and the Israelites in the promises which he had given them of success against the Syrians. And, 4th, In the midst of all their calamities to comfort such Israelites as were Elisha’s followers, with the hopes of that eternal life, whereof the reviving of this dead man was a manifest pledge, and to awaken the people to a due care about, and preparation for it. According to Calmet, this was further a symbol and prophecy of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, with this difference, and a mighty one it is, that Elisha raised a dead body without raising himself, while the Lord Jesus not only raised himself, but gives life to all those that believe in him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:20-25 God has many ways to chastise a provoking people. Trouble comes sometimes from that point whence we least feared it. The mention of this invasion on the death of Elisha, shows that the removal of God's faithful prophets is a presage of coming judgments. His dead body was a means of giving life to another dead body. This miracle was a confirmation of his prophecies. And it may have reference to Christ, by whose death and burial, the grave is made a safe and happy passage to life to all believers. Jehoash was successful against the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with the arrows, then a stop was put to his victories. Many have repented, when too late, of distrusts and the straitness of their desires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They cast the man - Rather, "they thrust the man." The graves of the Jews were not pits dug in the ground, like ours, but caves or cells excavated in the side of a rock, the mouth of the cave being ordinarily shut by a heavy stone.<p>Stood up on his feet - Coffins were not used by the Jews. The body was simply wrapped or swathed in grave-clothes (compare <a href="/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a>; <a href="/john/11-44.htm">John 11:44</a>).<p>This miracle of Elisha's after his death is more surprising than any of those which he performed during his lifetime. The Jews regarded it as his highest glory (compare Ecclesiaticus 48:13, 14). It may be said to belong to a class of Scriptural miracles, cases, i. e. where the miracle was not performed through the agency of a living miracle-worker, but by a material object in which, by God's will, "virtue" for the time resided (compare <a href="/acts/19-12.htm">Acts 19:12</a>). The primary effect of the miracle was, no doubt, greatly to increase the reverence of the Israelites for the memory of Elisha, to lend force to his teaching, and especially to add weight to his unfulfilled prophecies, as to that concerning the coming triumphs of Israel over Syria. In the extreme state of depression to which the Israelites were now reduced, a very signal miracle may have been needed to encourage and reassure them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Elisha died&#8212;He had enjoyed a happier life than Elijah, as he possessed a milder character, and bore a less hard commission. His rough garment was honored even at the court.<p>coming in of the year&#8212;that is, the spring, the usual season of beginning campaigns in ancient times. Predatory bands from Moab generally made incursions at that time on the lands of Israel. The bearers of a corpse, alarmed by the appearance of one of these bands, hastily deposited, as they passed that way, their load in Elisha's sepulchre, which might be easily done by removing the stone at the mouth of the cave. According to the Jewish and Eastern custom, his body, as well as that of the man who was miraculously restored, was not laid in a coffin, but only swathed; so that the bodies could be brought into contact, and the object of the miracle was to stimulate the king's and people of Israel's faith in the still unaccomplished predictions of Elisha respecting the war with the Syrians. Accordingly the historian forthwith records the historical fulfilment of the prediction (2Ki 13:22-25), in the defeat of the enemy, in the recovery of the cities that had been taken, and their restoration to the kingdom of Israel.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As they were burying, </span> or, were about to bury, as that particle is oft used in the Hebrew tongue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They spied a band of men</span> coming towards them, but at some distance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; </span> not daring to carry the dead corpse further to the place appointed for his burial, they made use of the next burying-place, where Elisha was buried, and there they removed some stone, or opened some door, and hastily flung down their dead corpse there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The man, </span> i.e. the man’s dead body, or the coffin in which he was put. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Touched the bones of Elisha; </span> which might easily be, the coffin and linen in which Elisha’s body was put, and the flesh of his body, being now consumed; for this was some considerable time after his death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He revived, and stood up on his feet; </span> which miracle God wrought there, partly, to do honour to that great prophet, and that by this seal he might confirm his doctrine, and thereby confute the false doctrine and worship of the Israelites; partly, to strengthen the faith of Joash, and of the Israelites, in his promise of their success against the Syrians; and partly, in the midst of all their calamities, to comfort such Israelites as were Elisha’s followers with the hopes of that eternal life whereof this was a manifest pledge, and to awaken the rest of that people to a due care and preparation for it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, as they were burying a man,.... That is, as they were going to bury him; for as yet they were not come to the place they designed to bury him at, as appears by what follows: <p>that, behold, they spied a band of men; one of the bands of the Moabites, which came to rob and plunder, and which was about the place where they intended to bury the man; or they supposed would be there by that time they got to it, or at least before they could bury him, and therefore being frightened stopped: <p>and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; that being nearest, they opened it, or rather rolled away the stone from it, and threw the body in great haste: <p>and when the man was let down, and touched the bone's of Elisha; or "went and touched" (r); that is, as Kimchi interprets it, being cast in, he rolled till he came to the body of the prophet, and touched it: <p>he revived, and stood upon his feet; which might serve to confirm the faith of Joash in the predictions of the prophet concerning his victories; is a proof of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal life, and an emblem of our being quickened through the death of Christ. The Jews say (s) this man was Shallum the son of Tikvah, and husband of Huldah the prophetess, and was a good man, much given to alms, for which he was rewarded; and they further say, he went to his own house, and lived many years, and begat children, and particularly Hananeel, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7</a>, which is not likely; though others say (t) he was a wicked man, Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah, <a href="/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24</a> and therefore not suffered to continue in the prophet's grave; but the former is more probable; and, according to Josephus (u), it was the band of robbers that left this man, whom they had murdered, in the grave of Elisha. This grave seems to have been in the field, where the Jews of old, and in later times, buried, as in the field of Hebron, the potter's field, &amp;c. so the Greeks, as Pausanias relates (w), and the Romans also (x), buried by the wayside. <p>(r)  "abit et tetigit", Pagninus, Montanus.

The body was carried on a bier, and was not enclosed in a coffin (cf. <a href="/context/luke/7-12.htm" title="Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her....">Luke 7:12-14</a>), so that when cast into the grave it would touch any other body which had been deposited there before. In the East the graves are usually excavated in the rock, and closed by a stone at the mouth. The bodies were laid there, but there was no covering them with earth as in burials among western nations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">behold they spied a band</span> of men] The R.V. omits the italics. The band was a band of the marauding Moabites, at whose approach the Israelites were terrified, and so made all haste to dispose of the corpse they were carrying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the sepulchre of Elisha</span>] This must have been nearer at hand than the grave which they intended to use. The distance from which the Moabites were visible allowed the bearers to open the first grave they came to, and there to lay down their burden, but gave time for nothing more. Josephus says that it was <span class="ital">the robbers</span> who had killed a man and that <span class="ital">they</span> cast him into Elisha’s grave (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> IX. 8. 6).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and when the man was let down and touched</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and as soon as the man touched</span>. It will be seen from the margin of R.V. that the Hebrew means ‘and when the man went and touched’; a very unusual kind of expression, but which does not warrant the idea conveyed by the A.V. that the body was lowered into the tomb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the bones of Elisha</span>] We need not press the literal sense of ‘bones’, as though a long time had elapsed since Elisha died. The lying prophet of Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:">1 Kings 13:31</a>), speaking of his own death and burial, says ‘Lay my <span class="ital">bones</span> beside his <span class="ital">bones</span>’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he revived and stood up on his feet</span>] The record of this miracle seems intended to set forth that it was nothing in the prophet himself which had given him the great powers he manifested in his lifetime. Through his dead body God could work a miracle also. ‘Israel shall well see that He lives, by whose virtue Elisha was, both in life and death, miraculous. While the prophet was alive, the impetration might seem to be his, though the power were God’s; now that he is dead, the bones can challenge nothing, but send the wandering Israelites to that Almighty agent to whom it is all one to work by the quick or dead.’ (Bp. Hall.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that.</span> "They" is used indefinitely of some unnamed Israelites, like the French on.

Hastily, and somewhat roughly, it may be, the bearers of the body thrust it into Elisha's tomb, which happened to be at hand, and from the mouth of which they were able to remove the closing stone. They did not "throw" the body in, but pushed it in. <span class="cmt_word">And when the man was let down.</span> The man was not "let down." Our translators seem to have been unacquainted with the Jewish mode of burial. They imagine that Elisha's tomb is a pit dug in the ground from the surface downwards, like a modern grave, and the man has therefore to be "let <span class="accented">down</span>," or to "go <span class="accented">down"</span> (marginal translation) into it.

At the moment of contact the dead man came to life  - "revived." <span class="cmt_word">And stood up on his feet.</span> In many Jewish tombs the sepulchral chamber would allow of this. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Take-said Elisha to Joash-bow and arrows, ... and let thy hand pass over the bow" (&#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;), i.e., stretch the bow. He then placed his hands upon the king's hands, as a sign that the power which was to be given to the bow-shot came from the Lord through the mediation of the prophet. He then directed him to open the window towards the east and shoot, adding as he shot off the arrow: "An arrow of salvation from the Lord, and an arrow of salvation against the Syrians; and thou wilt smite the Syrians at Aphek (see at <a href="/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26</a>) to destruction." The arrow that was shot off was to be a symbol of the help of the Lord against the Syrians to their destruction. This promise the king was then to appropriate to himself through an act of his own. Elisha therefore directed him (<a href="/2_kings/13-18.htm">2 Kings 13:18</a>) to "take the arrows;" and when he had taken them, said: &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492; &#1492;&#1498;, "strike to the earth," i.e., shoot the arrows to the ground, not "smite the earth with the bundle of arrows" (Thenius), which neither agrees with the shooting of the first arrow, nor admits of a grammatical vindication; for &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, when used of an arrow, signifies to shoot and to strike with the arrow shot off, i.e., to wound or to kill (cf. <a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>). The shooting of the arrows to the earth was intended to symbolize the overthrow of the Syrians. "And the king shot three times, and then stood (still)," i.e., left off shooting.</body></html>
