He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moab, the region immediately east of the Dead Sea and of the lower Jordan, though in part suited for agriculture, is in the main a great grazing country. Mesha resembled a modern Arab Sheikh, whose wealth is usually estimated by the number of his flocks and herds. His tribute of the wool of 100, 000 lambs was a tribute in kind, the ordinary tribute at this time in the East.<p>Mesha is the monarch who wrote the inscription on the "Moabite stone" (<a href="/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a> note). The points established by the Inscription are:<p>1. That Moab recovered from the blow dealt by David <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>, and became again an independent state in the interval between David's conquest and the accession of Omri;<p>2. That Omri reconquered the country, and that it then became subject to the northern kingdom, and remained so throughout his reign and that of his son Ahab, and into the reign of Ahab's son and successor, Ahaziah;<p>3. That the independence was regained by means of a war, in which Mesha took town after town from the Israelites, including in his conquests many of the towns which, at the original occupation of the holy land, had passed into the possession of the Reubenites or the Gadites, as Baal-Meon <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>, Kirjathaim <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>, Ataroth <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>, Nebo <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm">Numbers 32:38</a>, Jahaz <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>, etc.;<p>4.

King Jehoram &#8230; numbered Israel&#8212;made a levy from his own subjects, and at the same time sought an alliance with Jehoshaphat, which, as on the former occasion with Ahab, was readily promised (1Ki 22:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Out of Samaria, </span> to some place appointed for the rendezvous of his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All Israel, </span> to wit, such as were fit for war. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And King Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time,  As soon as he came to the throne: <p>and numbered all Israel; who were fit to bear arms, got them together at some certain place, and mustered them, and prepared for a war with Moab, to reduce them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_kings/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">went out of Samaria the same time</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">at that time</span>. The time indicated is probably the occasion of the first refusal of the tribute to Jehoram. He might perhaps regard the former refusal, which no doubt had been given to Ahaziah, as prompted by the knowledge that the king of Israel was weak and unfit for war, and so there was a good opportunity to strive for freedom. Hence he would wait till the season came round, and prepare his campaign when he found that he was to be treated with the same measure as his brother.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and numbered</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">mustered</span>. The verb implies a good deal more than the mere numbering. It includes all the inspection necessary to find whether an army is ready for war. Hence the king gathered the troops outside Samaria. The word ‘muster’ is the rendering of one form of this verb in A.V. (<a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm" title="The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts musters the host of the battle.">Isaiah 13:4</a>) but in most other passages ‘number’ is used for it. What Jehoram did was to gather together all the men of war from the ten tribes to a camp near Samaria and when all was arranged to start on his march.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time</span> - literally, the <span class="accented">same</span> day - <span class="cmt_word">and numbered all Israel</span>; rather, <span class="accented">mustered</span> or <span class="accented">reviewed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, LXX.) all Israel.
