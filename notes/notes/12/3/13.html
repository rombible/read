He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jehoram's humility in seeking <a href="/2_kings/3-12.htm">2 Kings 3:12</a> instead of summoning Elisha, does not save him from rebuke.

What have I to do with thee? &c.&#8212;Wishing to produce a deep spirit of humility and contrition, Elisha gave a stern repulse to the king of Israel, accompanied by a sarcastic sneer, in bidding him go and consult Baal and his soothsayers. But the distressed condition, especially the imploring language, of the royal suppliants, who acknowledged the hand of the Lord in this distress, drew from the prophet the solemn assurance, that solely out of respect to Jehoshaphat, the Lord's true servant, did he take any interest in Jehoram.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What have I to do with thee?</span> I desire to have no discourse nor converse with thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother, </span> i.e. to the calves, which thou after thy father’s example dost worship; and to the Baals which thy mother yet Worshippeth by thy permission, and to which thy heart is yet inclined, though thou hast destroyed one of his images for politic reasons.

We know indeed that this was not done. Only the special outward mark, ‘the pillar of Baal’ (verse 2), which indicated the royal attachment to the idolatrous rites, and stood perhaps in the king’s own ground, was put down. Jehoram would be forced to trust to the power of opinion to banish the worship completely. It is so much more easy to encourage wrong than to get rid of it. Hence to Elisha the acts of Jehoram would seem very fainthearted, and he would be held for a sharer in the ways of Ahab and Jezebel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nay</span>] i.e. Send me not away thus.

Jehoram must not be allowed to suppose that he has done enough by his half-repentance and partial reformation; he must be rebuked and shamed, that he may, if possible, be led on to a better frame of mind. "What," says the prophet, "have I to do with thee? What common ground do we occupy? What is there that justifies thee in appealing to me for aid? Get thee to the prophets of thy father" - the four hundred whom Ahab gathered together at Samaria, to advise him as to going up against Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>) - "and the prophets of thy mother," the Baal-prophets, whom Jezebel, who was still alive, and held the position of queen-mother, still maintained (<a href="/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19</a>) - "get thee to <span class="accented">them</span>, and consult <span class="accented">them</span>. On them thou hast some claim; on me, none." <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Israel said unto him; Nay: for the Lord hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> A most soft and meek answer - one well calculated to "turn away wrath." "Nay," says the king; "say not so. Let not that be thy final answer. For it is not I alone who am in danger. We are <span class="accented">three</span> kings who have come down to thee to ask thy aid; we are all in equal danger; have respect unto them, if thou wilt not have respect unto me; and show them a way of deliverance." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The statement concerning the rebellion of the Moabites, which has already been mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>, is repeated here, because it furnished the occasion for the expedition about to be described. Ahaziah had been unable to do anything during his short reign to renew the subjugation of Moab; Joram was therefore anxious to overtake what had been neglected immediately after his ascent of the throne. He went to Samaria &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, at that time, namely, when he renewed his demand for the tribute and it was refused (Thenius), and mustered all Israel, i.e., raised an army out of the whole kingdom, and asked Jehoshaphat to join in the war, which he willingly promised to do (as in <a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>), notwithstanding the fact that he had been blamed by prophets for his alliance with Ahab and Ahaziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>). He probably wished to chastise the Moabites still further on this occasion for their invasion of Judah (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>), and to do his part by bringing them once more under the yoke of Israel, to put it out of their power to make fresh incursions into Judah.</body></html>
