A kingdom may be upheld and prosper, in consequence of the fervent prayers of those who are dear to God. May we place our highest regard upon such as are most precious in his account. When sinners are saying Peace, peace, destruction comes upon them: despair will follow their mad presumption. In Satan's service and at his suggestion, such horrid deeds have been done, as cause the natural feelings of the heart to shudder; like the king of Moab's sacrificing his son.

The preceding year, they and their allies had mutually destroyed each other <a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>. It seemed to them, from their knowledge of the jealousies between Judah, Israel, and Edom, not unlikely that a similar calamity had now befallen their foes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-24. when the meat offering was offered&#8212;that is, at the time of the morning sacrifice, accompanied, doubtless, with solemn prayers; and these led, it may be, by Elisha on this occasion, as on a similar one by Elijah (1Ki 18:36).<p>behold, there came water by the way of Edom&#8212;Far from the Israelitish camp, in the eastern mountains of Edom, a great fall of rain, a kind of cloudburst, took place, by which the wady was at once filled, but they saw neither the wind nor the rains. The divine interposition was shown by introducing the laws of nature to the determined end in the predetermined way [Keil]. It brought not only aid to the Israelitish army in their distress, by a plentiful supply of water, but destruction on the Moabites, who, perceiving the water, under the refulgent rays of the morning sun, red like blood, concluded the confederate kings had quarrelled and deluged the field with their mutual slaughter; so that, rushing to their camp in full expectation of great spoil, they were met by the Israelites, who, prepared for battle, fought and pursued them. Their country was laid waste in the way, which has always been considered the greatest desolation in the East (2Ki 3:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They pursued them to their own country, and entered it with and after them; the passes, which before the Moabites defended, being now open for them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they came to the camp of Israel,....

Before their assailants could gather themselves for resistance they were able to put them to a confused flight.

The Hebrew text presents some difficulty here. The word which R.V. has represented by ‘into the land’ is literally ‘into it’. But as Moab (translated Moabites) has been mentioned in the previous clause the pronoun may fairly be referred to it. The verb ‘they went forward’ is not of the usual form and for <span class="greekheb">יכאו = יכו</span> the marginal reading of the Massoretic text suggests <span class="greekheb">יכו</span> = they smote, and this the margin of A.V. translates, ‘and they smote in it, even smiting’. But the suggestion seems unnecessary. The LXX. read <span class="greekheb">יכו</span> for they give <span class="greekheb">εἰσῆλθον εἰσπορευόμενοι</span>, apparently having taken the preposition and pronoun <span class="greekheb">בה</span> for the verb <span class="greekheb">בוא</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up.</span> The first rush of the main body would be upon the camp, where they would expect to find the richest spoil. It was near at hand; and the occupants kept themselves concealed in it, expecting the disorderly attack which actually took place. They then "rose up," and fell upon the crowd of assailants, who were off their guard, and expecting nothing less. A confused rout followed. <span class="cmt_word">And smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them.</span> Josephus says, "Some of the Moabites were cut to pieces; the others fled, and dispersed themselves over their country." <span class="cmt_word">But they went forward, smiting the Moabites even in their country.</span> There are two readings here, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5d5;</span>.

In the announcement of the devastation of the land there is an allusion to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>, according to which the Israelites were ordered to spare the fruit-trees when Canaan was taken. These instructions were not to apply to Moab, because the Moabites themselves as the arch-foes of Israel would not act in any other way with the land of Israel if they should gain the victory. &#1492;&#1499;&#1488;&#1489;, to add pain, is a poetical expression for spoiling a field or rendering it infertile through the heaping up of stones.</body></html>
