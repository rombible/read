The former was the shortest route for both kings. But Moab’s strongest defences were on the north frontier, and the allies would be liable to attacks from the Syrians in Ramoth-gilead (<a href="/2_kings/8-28.htm" title="And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.">2Kings 8:28</a>). The longer and more difficult southern road may have been chosen partly on these grounds, and partly because Jehoshaphat wished to march as far as might be within his own territory, and to get a contingent from Edom, which was at this time subject to him (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48</a>), and perhaps to hold it in check.

He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The readiest and most natural "way" was across the Jordan near Jericho into the Arboth-Moab, and then along the eastern shore of the Dead Sea to Moab proper, the tract south of the Arnon. But the way chosen was that which led to the Edomite country, namely, round the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and across the Arabah, or continuation of the Jordan and Dead Sea valley. Thus would be effected a junction with the forces of Edom, which had resumed its dependence on Judah, though the year before it had been in alliance with Moab <a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>; and they would come upon the Moabites unprepared. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-12. Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom&#8212;This was a long and circuitous route, by the southern bend of the Dead Sea. Jehoshaphat however preferred it, partly because the part of the Moabite territory at which they would arrive, was the most defenseless; and partly because he would thereby enlist, in the expedition, the forces of the king of Edom. But, in penetrating the deep, rocky valley of Ahsy, which forms the boundary between Edom and Moab, the confederate army was reduced, both man and beast, to the greatest extremities for want of water. They were disappointed by finding the wady of this valley, the brook Zered (De 2:13-18) [Robinson], dry. Jehoram was in despair. But the pious mind of Jehoshaphat inquired for a prophet of the Lord; and, on being informed that Elisha was at hand, the three kings "went down to him"; that is, to his tent, which was either in the camp, or close by it. He had been directed thither by the Spirit of God for this special purpose. They went to him, not only as a mark of respect, but to supplicate for his assistance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He said; </span> either Jehoshaphat; or rather, Jehoram; for the following answer may seem to be Jehoshaphat’s. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Through the wilderness of Edom; </span> which though it was much the longer way, yet they thought it best; partly to secure the king or viceroy of Edom, of whom they might have some suspicion, from that passage, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm" title="And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.">2 Chronicles 20:22</a></span>, and to carry both him and his soldiers along with them into the war, both to get their assistance, and to prevent them from, making a war of diversion against Judah, whilst Jehoshaphat was engaged against Moab; and partly that they might invade Moab on their weakest side, and where they least expected them. God also thus disposed their hearts to make way for the following miracle. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, which way shall we go up.... That is, Jehoram said so to Jehoshaphat, consulting with him which was the best way to take to the land of Moab, whether the shortest way, over Jordan; or some other: <p>and he answered, the way through the wilderness of Edom; which bordered upon it, and the same through which the Israelites passed; for Kadesh was on the extreme border of Edom, whither they came, <a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a> and this Jehoshaphat proposed, partly that they might come upon Moab unawares, and attack them where they were weakest, and not on their guard; and partly, to take the king of Edom with them, who was no other than Jehoshaphat's deputy, and so be assisting to them, and prevent him from revolting, which otherwise he might take this opportunity of doing. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said, Which way shall we go up?

They might have crossed the Jordan to the north of the Dead Sea and so come upon Moab from the north, but they would have had more difficulty then in bringing the king of Edom and his army along with them. The LXX. has ‘Which way shall <span class="ital">I</span> go up?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through the wilderness of Edom</span>] It would seem from <a href="/1_kings/22-47.htm" title="There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.">1 Kings 22:47</a> (see note there) that the Edomite royal family had come to an end, and that Jehoshaphat claimed the rights over that land which had been held in former times by Solomon. Hence the ‘deputy’ spoken of in that passage as ‘king of Edom’ would be one set up and maintained on his throne by the king of Judah. We can see from this how the way through Edom would be easy and would commend itself to Jehoshaphat.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Which way shall we go up?</span> Jehoram asked Jehoshaphat's advice as to the plan of campaign. There 'were two ways in which Moab might be approached - the direct one across the Jordan and then southward through the country east of the Dead Sea to the Amen, which was the boundary between Moab and Israel; and a circuitous one through the desert west of the Red Sea, and across the Arabah south of it, then northwards through Northern Edom, to the brook Zered, or Wady-el- Ahsy, which was the boundary between Moab and Edom. If the former route were pursued, Moab would be entered on the north; if the latter, she would be attacked on the south. Jehoshaphat recommended the circuitous route. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom</span>; probably for two reasons: Edom, though under a native king, was a dependency of Judah (<a href="/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and on passing through the Edomite country, an Edomite contingent might be added to the invading force; Moab, moreover, was mere likely to be surprised by an attack on this quarter, which was unusual, and from which she would not anticipate danger. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Joram of Israel. - For the chronological statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>, see at <a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>. Joram or Jehoram was not so ungodly as his father Ahab and his Mother Jezebel. He had the statue or pillar of Baal, which his father had erected in Samaria, removed; and it was only to the sin of Jeroboam, i.e., the calf-worship, that he adhered. Joram therefore wished to abolish the worship of Baal and elevate the worship of Jehovah, under the image of the calf (ox), into the region of his kingdom once more. For the singular suffix &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; see Ewald, 317, a. He did not succeed, however, in exterminating the worship of Baal. It not only continued in Samaria, but appears to have been carried on again in the most shameless manner (cf. <a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18</a>.); at which we cannot be surprised, since his mother Jezebel, that fanatical worshipper of Baal, was living throughout the whole of his reign (<a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>). </body></html>
