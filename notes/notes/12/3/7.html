He called these kings together, yet he charges it upon Providence. Thus the foolishness of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth against the Lord, Pr 19:3. It was well that Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord now, but it had been much better if he had done it before he engaged in this war. Good men sometimes neglect their duty, till necessity and affliction drive them to it. Wicked people often fare the better for the friendship and society of the godly. To try their faith and obedience, Elisha bids them make the valley full of pits to receive water. Those who expect God's blessings, must dig pools for the rain to fill, as in the valley of Baca, and thus make even that a well, Ps 84:6. We need not inquire whence the water came. God is not tied to second causes. They that sincerely seek for the dew of God's grace, shall have it, and by it be made more than conquerors.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The close alliance between the two kingdoms still subsisted. Jehoram therefore sends confidently to make the same request with respect to Moab that his father had made two years before with respect to Syria (marginal reference). Jehoshaphat consented at once, notwithstanding that his former compliance had drawn upon him the rebuke of a prophet <a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>. Perhaps Jehoram's removal of the Baal-worship <a href="/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2</a> weighed with him. He had himself been attacked by the Moabites in the preceding year; and though the attempt had failed, Jehoshaphat would feel that it might be renewed, and that it was important to seize the opportunity of weakening his enemy which now offered itself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 3:6-24.

He joins with him in this war, partly because the war was very just in itself, and convenient for Jehoshaphat, both in the general, that rebels and revolters should be chastised and suppressed, lest the example should pass into his dominions, and the Edomites should be hereby encouraged to revolt from him, as they did from his son; and in particular, that the Moabites should be humbled, who had with others invaded his land before this time, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.">2 Chronicles 20:1</a></span>, and might do so again if they were not brought low, for which a fair opportunity was now offered to him; and partly because Jehoram had reformed some things, and Jehoshaphat hoped by this means to engage him to proceed further in that work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, the king of Moab hath rebelled against me,....

Thus <a href="/exodus/2-1.htm" title="And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.">Exodus 2:1</a>, ‘There <span class="ital">went a man</span> … and took to wife a daughter of Levi’.

Cf. Ahab’s message to king Jehoshaphat (<a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm" title="And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.">1 Kings 22:4</a>). Jehoshaphat gives to Jehoram almost the same reply which he had given on the previous occasion to his father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will go up</span>] The hill country of Moab was considerably more elevated than the lands on the west of the Jordan; not so mountainous as Gilead, but sufficient to justify the expression of Jehoshaphat, though Jehoram had not used the word.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the King of Judah, saying.</span> Jehoshaphat had originally allied himself with Ahab, and had cemented the alliance by a marriage between his eldest son, Jehoram, and Athaliah, Ahab's daughter (<a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>). He had joined Ahab in his attack on the Syrians at Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>), and had thereby incurred the rebuke of Jehu the son of Hanani (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). This, however, had net prevented him from continuing his friendship with the Israelite royal house; he "joined himself with Ahaziah" (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a>), Ahab's successor, and though their combined naval expedition met with disaster (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), yet he still maintained amicable relations with the Israelite court. Jehoram, therefore, confidently sought his active help when he made up his mind to engage in a war with Moab. <span class="cmt_word">The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle! And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my hones as thy horses.</span> Compare the answer which the same king had made to Ahab, when requested to join him in his attack on the Syrians (<a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>). The words were probably a common formula expressive of willingness to enter into the closest possible alliance. Jehoshaphat, it appears from <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-35</a>, had, a little before this, been himself attacked by the united forces of Moab and Ammon, and brought into a peril from which he was only delivered by miracle. It was, therefore, much to his advantage that Moab should be weakened. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Joram of Israel. - For the chronological statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>, see at <a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>. Joram or Jehoram was not so ungodly as his father Ahab and his Mother Jezebel. He had the statue or pillar of Baal, which his father had erected in Samaria, removed; and it was only to the sin of Jeroboam, i.e., the calf-worship, that he adhered. Joram therefore wished to abolish the worship of Baal and elevate the worship of Jehovah, under the image of the calf (ox), into the region of his kingdom once more. For the singular suffix &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; see Ewald, 317, a. He did not succeed, however, in exterminating the worship of Baal. It not only continued in Samaria, but appears to have been carried on again in the most shameless manner (cf. <a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18</a>.); at which we cannot be surprised, since his mother Jezebel, that fanatical worshipper of Baal, was living throughout the whole of his reign (<a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>). </body></html>
