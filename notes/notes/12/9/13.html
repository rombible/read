(Comp. <a href="/luke/19-36.htm" title="And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.">Luke 19:36</a>.) The instantaneous action of the generals shows that there must have existed a strong feeling against Joram in the army and an enthusiasm for Jehu which only required a word from him to precipitate a revolution.<p><span class= "bld">Put it under him on the top of the stairs.</span>—So Kimchi, “at the uppermost step.” The words are much discussed by commentators. The LXX. has, “and put it underneath him on the <span class= "ital">garem</span> of the steps” (retaining the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">gèrem</span>); the Syriac, “and put it under him on a seat of steps;” the Targum, “at the steps of the hours,” i.e., a flight of steps which served as a sundial (comp. <a href="/2_kings/20-11.htm" title="And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.">2Kings 20:11</a>); the Vulg., “and each one, taking his cloak, put it under his feet <span class= "ital">in similitudinem tribunalis</span>,” <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in the fashion of a rostrum, or elevated platform; the Arabic, “on the steps of the rise” (or “elevation”).<p>The word <span class= "ital">gèrem</span>, rendered “top,” can hardly have that meaning. In Hebrew it rarely occurs (<a href="/proverbs/17-22.htm" title="A merry heart does good like a medicine: but a broken spirit dries the bones.">Proverbs 17:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-15.htm" title="By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.">Proverbs 25:15</a>), and means <span class= "ital">bone</span>, for which in Aramaic it is the usual term (<a href="/daniel/6-25.htm" title="Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.">Daniel 6:25</a>). In Arabic the word means “body,” and it is usually so explained in one passage of the Bible (<a href="/genesis/49-14.htm" title="Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:">Genesis 49:14</a>), “Issachar is a strong ass;” literally, <span class= "ital">an ass of body</span>. As the Aramaic <span class= "ital">garmâ</span> is used in the sense of “self,” some would render the present phrase, “on the stairs themselves.” But perhaps we may better translate on the analogy of the Arabic word, “They put (their cloaks) under him, on to (‘el) the body of the stairs.” The stairway on the outside of the house, leading to the roof, served as an extemporised throne, or rather platform, for the king. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>.)

But above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable.

That general returned to join his brother officers in the public apartment, who, immediately on learning his destined elevation, conducted him to the top of the stairs leading to the roof. This was the most conspicuous place of an Oriental structure that could be chosen, being at the very top of the gate building, and fully in view of the people and military in the open ground in front of the building [Kitto]. The popularity of Jehu with the army thus favored the designs of Providence in procuring his immediate and enthusiastic proclamation as king, and the top of the stairs was taken as a most convenient substitute for a throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then they hasted; </span> being well-pleased with the thing; partly, from the advantage which hereby they expected; partly, from that desire of change which is in most men’s natures; and principally, by God’s providence inclining their hearts to Jehu. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Took every man his garment, </span> and put it under him; a ceremony used in the eastern parts towards superiors, in token of great reverence to his person, that they would not have his feet to touch the ground, and that they put themselves and their concerns under his feet, and into his disposal. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/matthew/21-7.htm" title="And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.">Matthew 21:7</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On the top of the stairs; </span> in some high and eminent place, whence he might be seen and owned by all the soldiers, who were called together upon this great occasion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs,....

The expression ‘under him’ shews what use was made of all the garments. Some have thought that the robes were used as a carpet, and laid all the way up the stairs from the court where they had been in conference. The stairs were outside the building and went from the courtyard up to the roof. Thus Jehu would have walked in state to the place which they chose for the proclamation. But the conspirators were in too great haste for this sort of parade. They extemporised a cushion with their robes, and set Jehu upon them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on the top of the stairs</span>] There is some difficulty in explaining the word rendered ‘top’. Primarily it means ‘a bone’. Then something strong and firm. Hence it has been thought to have the sense here of the body of the staircase, and so to signify ‘the stairs themselves’. Thus the translation would be merely ‘on the stairs’. Others clinging to the sense of ‘bone’ have translated ‘on the bare steps’ (R.V. margin). The Vulgate appears to have taken the word as equivalent to ‘in the manner of’ and translates ‘in similitudinem tribunalis’. But without the steps there could be little made by the garments to look like a rostrum or tribune. The LXX. merely transliterates the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ γαρὲμ</span>. The sense ‘top’ is obtained by considering that the prominent part of the staircase is meant by this expression, and that for the purpose here desired, the best possible place was that where Jehu would be set above the people. The generals must have gathered such a company as they could on a short notice, and when Jehu was seated in the best state they could prepare, have made their proclamation while he sat on the extemporized throne.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">blew with trumpets</span>] For this cf. the proclamation of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/1-34.htm" title="And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow you with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.">1 Kings 1:34</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs.</span> Kings were honored by the spreading of garments in their way, that their feet might not touch the dusty ground (<a href="/matthew/20-8.htm">Matthew 20:8</a>). The captains of the host, without hesitation, acclaimed Jehu king on the strength of the prophetical announcement, made his cause their own, and joined in his rebellion. It is reasonably conjectured (Bahr) that "a deep dissatisfaction with Joram must have prevailed in the <span class="accented">army</span>," though whether the dissatisfaction arose from the idolatry of the house of Ahab, or from Joram's withdrawal from the war, may be doubted, Jehu, on the ether hand, was evidently highly esteemed. The captains threw themselves with ardor into his cause, and extemporized a sort of enthronement. As often in an Oriental house, an external staircase led from the court to the upper story or to the roof. This they carpeted with their <span class="accented">begeds</span>, or outer cloaks, and, seating him on the top stair, saluted him as actual king. The expression, <span class="accented">el-gerem ham-ma'aloth</span>, is not literally, "on the <span class="accented">top</span> of the stairs," but rather "on the stairs <span class="accented">themselves</span>."

There the pupil of the prophets poured oil upon Jehu's head, and announced to him that Jehovah had anointed him king for Israel, and that he was to smite, i.e., exterminate, the house of Ahab, to avenge upon it the blood of the prophets (vid., <a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>).</body></html>
