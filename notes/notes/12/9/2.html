The superscription is: “Tribute of Ya’ua, son of Humrì (Omri)—(ingots of) silver and gold, a bowl of gold, ewers of gold, goblets of gold, buckets of gold, (ingots of) lead, a rod of the hand of the king, spears—I received it.”<p><span class= "bld">Go in.</span>—Into Jehu’s house.<p><span class= "bld">From among his brethren</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, his comrades in arms; his fellow-captains.<p><span class= "bld">Carry him.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">cause him to enter</span>.

But in the case of Jehu, in whom the succession of the kingdom of Israel was to be translated out of the right line of the family of Ahab into another family, which had no right to the kingdom, but merely the appointment of God, there was a necessity for his unction, in order both to convey to him a title, and to invest him in the actual possession of the kingdom.” — Dodd. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-10 In these and the like events, we must acknowledge the secret working of God, disposing men to fulfil his purposes respecting them. Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed.

Elijah had been bidden to anoint him king, but apparently had neglected to do so, or rather had devolved the task upon his successor. Meantime Jehu served as a soldier under Ahaziah and Jehoram, Ahab's sons, and attained such distinction that he became one of the captains of the host (<span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 5), according to Josephus (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.) the chief captain. Jehu was commonly known as "the son of Nimshi" (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-20.htm">2 Kings 9:20</a>), either because, his father having died young, he was brought up by his grandfather, or perhaps simply "because Nimshi was a person of more importance than Jehoshaphat." <span class="cmt_word">And go in</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, seek his presence, go into his quarters, wherever they may be, have direct speech with him - <span class="cmt_word">and make him arise up from among his brethren</span> (comp. vers. 5 and 6).

Secrecy was of extreme importance, lest Joram should get knowledge of what was happening, and prepare himself for resistance. Had he not been taken by surprise, the result might have been a long and bloody civil war. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reign of Ahaziah of Judah (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-1.htm">2 Chronicles 22:1-6</a>). - Ahaziah, the youngest son of Joram, ascended the throne in the twenty-second year of his age. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a>, that he was forty-two years old when he became king, rests upon a copyist's error, namely, a confusion of &#1499; twenty with &#1502; forty. Now, since his father became king at the age of thirty-two, and reigned eight years, Ahaziah must have been born in the nineteenth year of his age. Consequently it may appear strange that Ahaziah had brothers still older than himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>); but as early marriages are common in the East, and the royal princes had generally concubines along with their wife of the first rank, as is expressly stated of Joram in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>, he might have had some sons in his nineteenth year. His mother was called Athaliah, and was a daughter of the idolatrous Jezebel. In <a href="/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/22-2.htm">2 Chronicles 22:2</a> she is called the daughter, i.e., grand-daughter, of Omri; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>, she was a daughter of Ahab. Omri, the grand-father, is mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a> as the founder of the dynasty which brought so much trouble upon Israel and Judah through its idolatry. </body></html>
