Moreover, different computations might make the same year the eleventh or tweftth of Joram. (The verse is a parenthesis, and perhaps spurious.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:16-29 Jehu was a man of eager spirit. The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin. It is dangerous to join evil-doers; we shall be entangled in guilt and misery by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the eleventh year - The twelfth according to <a href="/2_kings/8-25.htm">2 Kings 8:25</a>.

It is not usual to mention the date at which a king begins to reign, after his death, but at his accession. This was done for Ahaziah in <a href="/2_kings/8-25.htm" title="In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.">2 Kings 8:25</a>, but there it is said that it was in the <span class="ital">twelfth</span> year of Joram that his reign began. So small a variation is of very little account when we consider how the Jews reckoned the regnal years of their kings, but the unusual position of the notice in this verse casts some suspicion upon it. The LXX. however represents it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Israel.</span> In <a href="/2_kings/8-25.htm">2 Kings 8:25</a> the accession of Ahaziah is placed in Joram's twelfth, instead of his eleventh, year.
