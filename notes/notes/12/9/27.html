Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin.

The garden house may have been some building at the extremity of the domain by which flight from the scene of destruction appeared easy to Ahaziah. The LXX. however treats it as a proper name, writing <span class="greekheb">Βαιθγάν</span>. This has been supposed to be the same as En-gannim = ‘the well of the gardens’ which is identified with the modern <span class="ital">Jenin</span>. This place lies south from Jezreel on the road to Samaria, and would be on the shortest route by which Ahaziah could make his way to Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And Jehu followed after him</span>] i.e. In the person of his partizans and followers, to whom he gave the order ‘Smite him also’. Jehu wished to get into Jezreel as soon as possible, and left the fate of the king of Judah to others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Smite him also in the chariot</span>] In the original the command continues ‘at the going up to Gur’ (R.V. at the ascent of Gur), as though Jehu knowing the country specified to his men the place where they would be most likely to overtake Ahaziah, where the ground began to rise, and so would retard his flight. This seeming somewhat unnatural, the A.V. inserted ‘And they did so’, the R.V. ‘and they smote him’. Neither Gur nor Ibleam have been identified, and there is some difference between the statements here and the narrative in Chronicles. There we read (<a href="/2_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.">2 Chronicles 22:9</a>) that Jehu ‘sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (for he was hid in Samaria) and brought him to Jehu, and when they had slain him they buried him’. The LXX. in this passage has a rendering which suggests how the two accounts may be reconciled. There it is said that Ahaziah had gone to Samaria to be cured (<span class="greekheb">ἰατρευόμενον</span>). Suppose that in the pursuit Jehu’s command to smite him had been carried out, and the wounded king escaped to Samaria in which direction he was hurrying. If he remained there to have his wound attended to, the emissaries of Jehu might discover him, when the new king came to his capital to take possession, and Ahaziah might then be taken to Megiddo and slain. The Chronicler speaks more at length on the particulars of Ahaziah’s death, as the evil issue of an alliance between a king of Judah and the house of Ahab was the sort of lesson on which it suited his purpose to dwell.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And he fled</span> to <span class="ital">Megiddo</span>] Megiddo was on the southern extremity of the plain of Esdraelon, and by its position was a place of much strategical importance. It had a king when the Israelites entered Canaan, and it was the scene of the battle against the Canaanites in the days of Deborah. It was a place of importance in the days of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-12.htm" title="Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:">1 Kings 4:12</a>) for he made it one of his commissariat stations. At a later period it was the scene of Josiah’s death (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2 Kings 23:29</a>) when he had taken part with Assyria against Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt. If we consider ‘Samaria’ in <a href="/2_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.">2 Chronicles 22:9</a> to mean ‘the land of Samaria’ and not the city, Megiddo was a part thereof, and in that way another method of reconciling the narratives in Kings and Chronicles would be found.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and died there</span>] It was part of Jehu’s commission to have Ahaziah slain, for he was Ahab’s grandson.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-29.</span> <span class="accented">- Murder of Ahaziah</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house.</span> As soon as Ahaziah saw Jehu shoot his arrow, he too took to flight; not, however, in the same direction as Joram, but southwards, towards his own land. If "garden house" is the right translation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, we can say no more than that it was probably one of the lodges of the royal demesne, which lay south-east and south of Jezreel, whereof nothing more is known. But it is quite possible that we ought to translate, with the LXX., "by the way of Beth-Gan" - <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x28;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>. In this case "Beth-Gan" would be a village or town, probably identical with En-gannim, which lay at the foot of the hills bounding the Plain of Esdraelon, nearly due south of Jezreel (Zerin), and which is now known as Jenin (see the Map of Western Palestine, by Mr. Trelawney Saunders, compiled from the surveys of the Palestine Exploration Fund, where Ahaziah's flight is well traced. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu followed after him; and said, Smite him also in the chariot</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his chariot</span>, not in that of Jehoram, since the two kings rode respectively in their own chariots (ver. 21). It was a bold step in a pretender not yet settled upon the throne to provoke the hostility of a neighboring country by murdering its monarch; but Jehu probably thought he had more to fear from Ahaziah himself, who had been on such close terms of friendship with Jehoram, than from any probable successors. He, therefore, finding him in his power, pursued after him and slew him. From a religious point of view he could justify the act; since the commission given to him (ver. 7) was to smite all the house of Ahab, and Ahaziah was Ahab's grandson. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. The "ascent of Gur," <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5be;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, was probably the rising ground between the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraslon and the place known as" Ibleam," or "Bileam" (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-70.htm">1 Chronicles 6:70</a>), which is reasonably identified with the modern <span class="accented">Bir-el-Belameh</span>, two miles south of Jenin. Here the steep ascent necessarily delayed the chariot, and Ahaziah's pursuers gained upon him, approached him, and wounded him. <span class="cmt_word">And he fled to Megiddo.</span> Wounded at the ascent of Gur, and despairing of making his way through the rough mountainous country which lay between him and Jerusalem, Ahaziah suddenly changed his route, perhaps thereby baffling his pursuers, and, skirting the hills, had himself conveyed to Megiddo (Ledjun), where he died, either of his wounds, or through some fresh violence on the part of Jehu (see <a href="/2_chronicles/12-8.htm">2 Chronicles 12:8, 9</a>). The reconciliation of <a href="/2_chronicles/12-8.htm">2 Chronicles 12:8, 9</a> with the present passage is difficult, but not wholly impossible.
