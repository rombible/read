Jehu was anointed king over Israel, by the Lord's special choice. The Lord still had a remnant of his people, and would yet preserve his worship among them. Of this Jehu was reminded. He was commanded to destroy the house of Ahab, and, as far as he acted in obedience to God, and upon right principles, he needed not to regard reproach or opposition. The murder of God's prophets is strongly noticed. Jezebel persisted in idolatry and enmity to Jehovah and his servants, and her iniquity was now full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chief officers - the generals - were assembled together in Jehu's quarters, perhaps holding a council of war.

So the young man &#8230; went to Ramoth-gilead&#8212;His ready undertaking of this delicate and hazardous mission was an eminent proof of his piety and obedience. The act of anointing being done through a commissioned prophet, was a divine intimation of his investiture with the sovereign power. But it was sometimes done long prior to the actual possession of the throne (1Sa 16:13); and, in like manner, the commission had, in this instance, been given also a long time before to Elijah [1Ki 19:16], who, for good reasons, left it in charge to Elisha; and he awaited God's time and command for executing it [Poole].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Smite, </span> i.e. kill and destroy, as that word is used, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm" title="And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.">Genesis 8:21</a></span>, and elsewhere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy master; </span> thy former lord and king. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master,....

Jehu is expressly ordered by God to "smite," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> destroy utterly, the whole house of Ahab. This command he carried out (vers. 24, 33; <a href="/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1-11</a>); and his obedience to it obtained for him the temporal reward that his children to the fourth generation should sit on the throne of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). Yet still his conduct in destroying the house of Ahab is spoken of by the Prophet Hosea as a sin, and God declares, by Hosea's mouth, that he will "avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu" (<a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>). It is naturally asked - "How could Jehu's shedding this blood, at God's command and in fulfillment of his will, be a sin?" And it is rightly answered, "Because, if we do what is the will of God for any end of our own, for anything except God, we do in fact our own will, not God's. It was not lawful for Jehu to depose and slay the king his master, except at the express command of God, <span class="accented">who</span>, as the supreme King, sets up and puts down earthly rulers as he wills. For any other end, and done otherwise than at God's express command, such an act is sin. Jehu was rewarded for the measure in which he fulfilled God's commands, as Ahab, 'who had sold himself to work wickedness,' had yet a temporal reward for humbling himself publicly, when rebuked by God for his sin, and so honoring God, amid an apostate people. But Jehu, by cleaving, against the will of God, to Jeroboam's sin (<a href="/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29, 31</a>), which served his own political ends, showed that, in the slaughter of his master, he acted, not as he pretended, out of zeal for the will of God (<a href="/2_kings/10-16.htm">2 Kings 10:16</a>), but served his own will and his own ambition only. By his disobedience to the one command of God, he showed that he would have equally disobeyed the other, had it been contrary to his own will or interest. He <span class="accented">had no principle of obedience</span>. And so the blood which was shed according to the righteous judgment of God, became sin to him that shed it in order to fulfill, not the will of God, but his own" (see Dr. Pusey's 'Minor Prophets, with a Commentary,' p. 9, col. 1). <span class="cmt_word">That I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets.</span> Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a> and 1 Kings 19:14. Elijah believed all the prophets of Jehovah, except himself, to have been either slain or banished under Ahab, as we see from <a href="/1_kings/18-22.htm">1 Kings 18:22</a> and 1 Kings 19:10, 14. <span class="cmt_word">And the blood of all the servants of the Lord.</span> There had evidently been a general persecution of the followers of Jehovah, and not merely a persecution of the prophets.

At the hand of Jezebel. Jezebel was at the bottom of all the persecutions. Sometimes she took matters into her own hands, gave her own orders, and saw them carried out (<a href="/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8-14</a>).

Schmidt).</body></html>
