See how a heart, hardened against God, will brave it out to the last. There is not a surer presage of ruin, than an unhumbled heart under humbling providences. Let those look at Jezebel's conduct and fate, who use arts to seduce others to commit wickedness, and to draw them aside from the ways of truth and righteousness. Jehu called for aid against Jezebel. When reformation-work is on foot, it is time to ask, Who sides with it? Her attendants delivered her up. Thus she was put to death. See the end of pride and cruelty, and say, The Lord is righteous. When we pamper our bodies, let us think how vile they are; shortly they will be a feast for worms under ground, or beasts above ground. May we all flee from that wrath which is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Leaving the mangled body on the bare earth, Jehu went to the banquet. It was, no doubt, important that he should at once show himself to the court as king. In calling Jezebel "this cursed one," Jehu means to remind his hearers that the curse of God had been pronounced upon her by Elijah <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-36.htm">2 Kings 9:36</a>, and so to justify his own conduct.<p>A king's daughter - Merely as the widow of Ahab and mother of Jehoram, Jehu would not have considered Jezebel entitled to buriah. But she was the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians (marginal reference), and so a princess born. This would entitle her to greater respect. Wilfully to have denied her burial would have been regarded as an unpardonable insult by the reigning Sidonian monarch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Ki 9:36, 37. Jezebel Eaten by Dogs.<p>36. This is the word of the Lord&#8212;(See 1Ki 21:23). Jehu's statement, however, was not a literal but a paraphrased quotation of Elijah's prophecy.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These words are not extant in the place where this prophecy is first mentioned, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm" title="And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.">1 Kings 21:23</a></span>, but are here added, either by Jehu, by way of explication and amplification; or rather, because Elijah spoke them, though they be not there recorded, as being for the substance of them contained in the former words; it being usual to insert some passages in following writings which had been omitted in the former. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel,....

Now though the words of this verse are not recorded elsewhere, as the words of the Lord, by Elijah, yet as Jehu was present when they were spoken, and within the hearing of them, he now remembered them, and could repeat them, these circumstances bringing them fresh to his mind. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; <i>so</i> that they shall not say, <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> This <i>is</i> Jezebel.</span><p>(p) Thus God's judgments appear even in this world against those who suppress his word and persecute his servants.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/83-10.htm">Psalm 83:10</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-22.htm">Jeremiah 9:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>, etc.).

When Jehu came to Jezreel and Jezebel heard of it, "she put her eyes into lead polish (i.e., painted them with it), and beautified her head and placed herself at the window." &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; is a very favourite eye-paint with Oriental women even to the present day. It is prepared from antimony ore (Arab. khl, Cohol or Stibium of the Arabs), which when pounded yields a black powder with a metallic brilliancy, which was laid upon the eyebrows and eyelashes either in a dry state as a black powder, or moistened generally with oil and made into an ointment, which is applied with a fine smooth eye-pencil of the thickness of an ordinary goose-quill, made either of wood, metal, or ivory. The way to use it was to hold the central portion of the pencil horizontally between the eyelids, and then draw it out between them, twisting it round all the while, so that the edges of the eyelids were blackened all round; and the object was to heighten the splendour of the dark southern eye, and give it, so to speak, a more deeply glowing fire, and to impart a youthful appearance to the whole of the eyelashes even in extreme old age. Rosellini found jars with eye-paint of this kind in the early Egyptian graves (vid., Hille, ber den Gebrauch u. die Zusammensetzung der oriental. Augenschminke: Deutsch. morg. Ztsch. v. p. 236ff.). - Jezebel did this that she might present an imposing appearance to Jehu and die as a queen; not to allure him by her charms (Ewald, after Ephr. Syr.). For (<a href="/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>) when Jehu entered the palace gate, she cried out to him, "Is it peace, thou Zimri, murderer of his lord?" She addressed Jehu as Zimri the murderer of the king, to point to the fate which Jehu would bring upon himself by the murder of the king, as Zimri had already done (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/16-10.htm">1 Kings 16:10-18</a>). </body></html>
