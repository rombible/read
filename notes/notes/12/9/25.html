The wisdom of God is seen in the choice of those employed in his work. But it is not for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that has rule over his own spirit, is better than the mighty. Joram met Jehu in the portion of Naboth. The circumstances of events are sometimes ordered by Divine Providence to make the punishment answer to the sin, as face answers to face in a glass. The way of sin can never be the way of peace, Isa 57:21. What peace can sinners have with God? No peace so long as sin is persisted in; but when it is repented of and forsaken, there is peace. Joram died as a criminal, under the sentence of the law. Ahaziah was joined with the house of Ahab. He was one of them; he had made himself so by sin.

By ‘riding together after Ahab’ we are not to understand that they were both together in the same chariot or both in Ahab’s chariot, but that they were together among the king’s retinue, when he went down to take possession of Naboth’s vineyard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">laid this burden upon him</span>] Or (as R.V. margin) ‘uttered this oracle against him’. The noun is that which is so often used by the prophets, especially Isaiah, for the oracle spoken against any city or nation.

Jehu recalls his captain's recollection to an occurrence which was deeply impressed upon his own. "When thou and I rode together after Ahab" probably means "when we two stood behind Ahab in his chariot." The Assyrian sculptures usually represent the monarch as attended by two body-guards, who ride in the same chariot with him, standing up behind him, and often interposing their shields to protect his person. In this near proximity Jehu and Bidkar would hear any speech which was addressed to Ahab. By a "burden" is meant a sentence of punishment (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>; etc.; <a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/2_kings/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the horsemen, who were sent to meet him on the announcement of the watchman upon the tower at Jezreel that a troop was approaching, joined the followers of Jehu, and eventually the watchman, looking down from the tower, thought that he could discover the driving of Jehu in the approaching troop, Joram and Ahaziah mounted their chariots to drive and meet him, and came upon him by the portion of the ground of Naboth the Jezreelite.
