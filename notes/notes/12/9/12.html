The captains reply to Jehu’s “Oh, you know all about it!” with the one word, “trickery!” i.e., “you are pretending!” “mere evasion!” They then assume a tone of persuasion: “Do tell us.” Even if they had really guessed the import of the prophet’s visit, their manner now convinced Jehu that he might safely trust them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:11-15 Those who faithfully deliver the Lord's message to sinners, have in all ages been treated as madmen. Their judgment, speech, and conduct are contrary to those of other men; they endure much in pursuit of objects, and are influenced by motives, into which the others cannot enter. But above all, the charge is brought by the worldly and ungodly of all sorts, who are mad indeed; while the principles and practice of the devoted servants of God, prove to be wise and reasonable. Some faith in the word of God, seems to have animated Jehu to this undertaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This mad fellow - The captains, seeing his excited look, his strange action, and his extreme haste, call him (as soldiers would) "this wild fellow." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_kings/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Is all well? &c.&#8212;Jehu's attendants knew that the stranger belonged to the order of the prophets by his garb, gestures, and form of address; and soldiers such as they very readily concluded such persons to be crackbrained, not only from the sordid negligence of their personal appearance and their open contempt of the world, but from the religious pursuits in which their whole lives were spent, and the grotesque actions which they frequently performed (compare Jer 29:26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_kings/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It is false:</span> there is something extraordinary and of great importance in his message, as we plainly perceive by his calling thee into an inner chamber, by his great expedition, and by his gesture and carriage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tell us now:</span> his concealment of the thing made them more greedy to know it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_kings/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they said, it is false, tell us now,.... They did not believe he spoke truth, but concealed from them the real matter; which they concluded to be of some importance, by the hastiness of the messenger, the privacy between them, the countenance of Jehu, which discovered thoughtfulness and concern, and the trifling answer he sought to put them off with; all which increased their curiosity, and made them urgent and importunate to know the truth of the matter: and he said: <p>thus and thus spake he to me; such and such words as above: and particularly <p>saying, thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel; and no doubt told them that he poured oil on his head, and anointed him, and he might show them the oil. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_kings/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they said, It is false; tell us now.

Jehu and his companions, being about the court of Ahab, Ahaziah and Joram, no doubt joined in the idolatry and excesses of the time. But at the voice of the prophet they are prepared to dethrone the house of Ahab and put Jehu in his place.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said, It is false.</span> There was no rudeness in the reply.
