Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/obadiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border - Destruction is more bitter, when friends aid in it. Edom had all along with unnatural hatred persecuted his brother, Jacob. So, in God's just judgment, its friends should be among its destroyers. Those confederates were probably Moab and Ammon, Tyre and Zidon, with whom they united to resist Nebuchadnezzar <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>, and seduced Zedekiah to rebel, although Moab, Ammon, and Edom turned against him <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a>. These then, he says, sent them "to the border."  "So will they take the adversary's part, that, with him, they will drive thee forth from the borders, thrusting thee into captivity, to gain favor with the enemy." This they would do, he adds, through mingled treachery and violence. "The men of thy peace have deceived, have prevailed against thee." As Edom turned peace with Judah into war, so those at peace with Edom should use deceit and violence against them, being admitted, perhaps, as allies within their borders, and then betraying the secret of their fastnesses to the enemy, as the Thessalians dealt toward the Greeks at Thermopylae. It was to be no common deceit, no mere failure to help them.<p>The men of "thy bread have laid a wound" (better, a snare)  "under thee." Perhaps Obadiah thought of David's words <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, "mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me." As they had done, so should it be done to them. "They that take the sword," our Lord says <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>, "shall perish by the sword;" so they who show bad faith, are the objects of bad faith, as Isaiah says . The proverb which says, "there is honor among thieves," attests how limited such mutual faith is. It lasts, while it seems useful. Obadiah's description relates to one and the same class, the allies of Edom; but it heightens as it goes on; not confederates only, but those confederates, friends; not friends only, but friends indebted to them, familiar friends; those joined to them through that tie, so respected in the East, in that they had eaten of their bread. Those banded with them should, with signs of friendship, conduct them to their border, in order to expel them; those at peace should prevail against them in war; those who ate their bread should requite them with a snare.<p>There is none understanding in him - The brief words comprise both cause and effect. Had Edom not been without understanding, he had not been thus betrayed; and when betrayed in his security, be was as one stupefied. Pride and self-confidence betray man to his fall; when he is fallen, self-confidence betrayed passes readily into despair. In the sudden shock, the mind collapses. People do not use the resources which they yet have, because what they had overvalued, fails them. Undue confidence is the parent of undue fear. The Jewish historian relates, how, in the last dreadful siege, when the outer wall began to give way , "fear fell on the tyrants, more vehement than the occasion called for. For, before the enemy had mounted, they were paralyzed, and ready to flee. You might see men, aforetime stouthearted and insolent in their impiety, crouching and trembling, so that, wicked as they were, the change was pitiable in the extreme. Here, especially, one might learn the power of God upon the ungodly. For the tyrants bared themselves of all security, and, of their own accord, came down from the towers, where no force, but famine alone, could have taken them: For those three towers were stronger than any engines." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/obadiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Men of thy confederacy&#8212;that is, thy confederates.<p>brought thee &#8230; to the border&#8212;that is, when Idumean ambassadors shall go to confederate states seeking aid, these latter shall conduct them with due ceremony to their border, giving them empty compliments, but not the aid required [Drusius]. This view agrees with the context, which speaks of false friends deceiving Edom: that is, failing to give help in need (compare Job 6:14, 15). Calvin translates, "have driven," that is, shall drive thee; shall help to drive thee to thy border on thy way into captivity in foreign lands.<p>the men that were at peace with thee&#8212;literally, "the men of thy peace." Compare Ps 41:9; Jer 38:22, Margin, where also the same formula occurs, "prevailed against thee."<p>they that eat thy bread&#8212;the poorer tribes of the desert who subsisted on the bounty of Edom. Compare again Ps 41:9, which seems to have been before Obadiah's mind, as his words were before Jeremiah's.<p>have laid a wound under thee&#8212;"laid" implies that their intimacy was used as a SNARE laid with a view to wound; also, these guest friends of Edom, instead of the cushions ordinarily laid under guests at table, laid snares to wound, that is, had a secret understanding with Edom's foe for that purpose. Maurer translates, "a snare." But English Version agrees with the Hebrew, which means, literally, "a bandage for a wound."<p>none understanding&#8212;none of the wisdom for which Edom was famed (see Ob 8) to extricate him from his perilous position.<p>in him&#8212;instead of "in thee." The change implies the alienation of God from Edom: Edom has so estranged himself from God, that He speaks now of him, not to him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/obadiah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the men of thy confederacy; </span> they who by league had bound themselves to assist with men and arms, who had made an offensive and defensive league. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have brought thee even to the border; </span> either have conducted in honourable manner through their country the ambassadors thou didst send, concluded first a confederacy, and next conveyed home the ambassadors who made it; or else have counselled thee to meet the war before it entereth thy country, and have marched as confederates with thee until thou weft come to the borders of thy country, as if they would there tight for thee against the enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The men that were at peace with thee:</span> this is ingemination, or repeating of the same thing before mentioned, unless <span class="ital">men of thy peace</span> be men that did make peace, and accept the terms thou didst propose for thy advantage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have deceived thee; </span> proved treacherous, nay, designed to betray thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Prevailed against thee; </span> either thus their plot took, or else they turned to the enemy, and under his colours destroyed thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They that eat thy bread; </span> thy friends, those thou hast maintained, the soldiers thou keptest in pay. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have laid a wound under thee; </span> have laid a snare, armed with some sharp and piercing instrument, that wounds as soon as thou fallest on the snare. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There is none understanding in him; </span> either no prudence to foresee and prevent this, or to manage and lessen it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/obadiah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border,.... Or of "thy covenant" (r); that are in league with thee; thine allies, even all of them, prove treacherous to thee, in whom thou trustedst; when they sent their ambassadors to them, they received them kindly, promised great things to them, dismissed them honourably, accompanied them to the borders of their country, but never stood to their engagements: or those allies came and joined their forces with the Edomites, and went out with them to meet the enemy, as if they would fight with them, and them; but when they came to the border of the land they left them, and departed into their own country; or went over to the enemy; or these confederates were the instruments of expelling them out of their own land, and sending them to the border of it, and carrying them captive; or they followed them to the border of the land, when they were carried captive, as if they lamented their case, when they were assisting to the enemy, as Kimchi; so deceitful were they. The Targum is to the same purpose, <p>"from the border all thy confederates carried thee captive (s):'' <p>the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; outwitted them in their treaties of peace, and got the advantage of them; or they proved treacherous to them, and joined the enemy against them; or they persuaded them to declare themselves enemies to the Chaldeans, which proved their ruin; and so they prevailed against them: <p>they that eat thy bread: so the Targum and Kimchi supply it; or it may be supplied from the preceding clause, "the men of thy bread"; who received subsidies from them, were maintained by them, and quartered among them: <p>have laid a wound under thee; instead of supporting them, secretly did that which was wounding to them.

The general drift of this verse is plain. It introduces another particular in which the pride of Edom had deceived her. Her trust in the wisdom of her policy, in the sagacious alliances which she had formed, should fail her no less signally than her confidence in the natural security of her position. But the details of the verse, as regards both the alliances referred to and the meaning of some of the expressions used, are not without difficulty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the men of thy confederacy</span>] As regards the first of these points, the majority of commentators understand by “the men of thy confederacy,” “the men that were at peace with thee,” neighbouring nations, “probably Moab and Ammon, Tyre and Zidon” (Pusey); or, “Arabian tribes” (Speaker’s <span class="ital">Comm.</span>). But there is reason to believe that the Edomites shared a common fate with the Moabites and Ammonites at the hands of the Chaldean invader, when after the destruction of Jerusalem he was pushing his way towards Egypt. (See Introd. § 3, comp. Ezekiel 25.) It is of course possible that the Edomites were the first to suffer, and that when Nebuchadnezzar came upon them they were deserted and betrayed by their neighbours and allies in the manner described in this verse. But it is at least worthy of consideration (it is a view which Calvin appears to assume as a matter of course) whether the Chaldeans themselves are not intended by “the men of thy confederacy,” “the men that were at peace with thee,” of whom the prophet speaks. Well might Edom plume himself upon the “understanding” which led him, on the approach of Nebuchadnezzar towards Judea, to make alliance with him, and thus to seize an opportunity of at once venting his ancient spite upon Israel, and securing himself against the attack of the invader. But the wisdom of this astute policy should prove in the issue to be foolishness. It should justify and call forth on the part of the beholder the exclamation, “There is no understanding in him!” The Chaldean should use Edom for his purpose, and then take and destroy him in his own craftiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have brought thee even to the border</span>] This has been taken to mean that the neighbouring nations, thy allies, to whom thou sentest for help in thy time of need, have conducted back to the border or frontier thy ambassadors with all the usual marks of respect, but have courteously declined to render thee assistance. The words, however, may mean, have “driven thee out,” R.V. margin (as in <a href="/genesis/3-23.htm" title="Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from from where he was taken.">Genesis 3:23</a>, <a href="/1_kings/9-7.htm" title="Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:">1 Kings 9:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorce, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have you sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.">Isaiah 50:1</a>, where the same verb is used), and may refer to the Chaldeans. This meaning is given to them by some commentators who understand the reference to be to neighbouring tribes, who are thus described, they think, as not merely refusing aid to Edom, but taking active part with the Chaldeans against him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">prevailed against thee</span>] This may mean prevailed against thee in counsel, outwitted thee, but it is simpler to take it of actual violence and physical compulsion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee</span>] The words, “they that eat” are not in the Hebrew. Many commentators connect them with the preceding clause, an arrangement which the order of the words in the original facilitates: <span class="ital">they have prevailed against thee, the men of thy peace, of thy bread</span>, i.e. the men who were, at peace with thee and who ate thy bread. But it is better to take the clause, “thy bread they make a wound (or a net) under thee,” separately, and to understand it to mean that thy allies and confederates make thy bread which they eat (and the sacred obligation according to Eastern ideas of eating bread together must not here be lost sight of), or thy table at which they sit, an occasion to deal thee a secret and deadly wound, or to catch thee as it were in the snare of their insidious plots against thee. If the rendering “snare” be adopted, and it seems on the whole preferable, the passage receives elucidation from the words of the Psalmist (<a href="/psalms/69-22.htm" title="Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.">Psalm 69:22</a>):<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Let their table before them become a snare,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And when they are in peace (let it be) a trap;”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>of which “perhaps the meaning may be: let them be like persons who while sitting at their meals ‘in peace,’ in security, unarmed, and unsuspecting, are suddenly surprised by their enemies. Their ‘table becomes a snare,’ as exposing them to certain destruction.” Dean Perowne, <span class="ital">on the Psalms</span>. The whole verse may then be paraphrased: “Thy confederates, the Chaldeans with whom thou didst enter into treaty, have driven thee to the border of thy country on every side, and expelled thee totally from it. Those that were at peace with thee have treated thee with mingled treachery and violence. The Chaldeans whom thou regardedst as friends have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee. Thy bread which they ate, they have used as a snare to entrap thee, taking advantage of the friendly relations which existed to work thy unlooked-for ruin. There is no understanding in him! To think that the vaunted penetration of Edom should have betrayed him into so humiliating and complete an overthrow!”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In this dire calamity Eden shall be deserted by her friends and allies - a punishment for her behaviour to her sister Judah. <span class="cmt_word">The men of thy confederacy.</span> The LXX. and the Vulgate annex these words to the following clause. The allies intended may be Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, who joined together to resist Nebuchadnezzar, and were smitten by him (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>); or, as Perowne thinks, the Chaldeans themselves, who, though the Edomites had aided in the attack on Jerusalem, afterwards turned against them.

It is easier to understand the passage in this way - Thy very allies have assisted the enemy in ex-polling thee from thy borders, and refusing to receive fugitives who came to them. The men that were at peace with thee. Either the same as "the men of thy confederacy," or the neighbouring Arabian tribes who resorted to Petra for commercial reasons (comp. <a href="/judges/4-17.htm">Judges 4:17</a>). The phrase here, literally, <span class="accented">the men of thy peace</span>, is found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> and Jot. 38:22. Have deceived thee, by not bringing the expected help; and have prevailed against thee, by actual violence. They that eat thy bread. The Hebrew is simply, "thy bread," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of thy bread. Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui comedunt tecum</span>; <span class="accented">the</span> LXX. omits the words. The expression (comp. <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>)  implies the closest friendship, especially in Eastern lands, where such a tie is of general obligation. <span class="cmt_word">Have laid a wound under thee;</span> rather, <span class="accented">lay a snare under thee</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "they set snares under thee;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ponent insidias subter te</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22</a>). Another interpretation is this: "As thy bread (which they as friends were bound to offer) they lay a sling under thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> prepare an ambush for thee, like Jael did for Sisera. Pusey notes the climax in this verse - not confederates only, but friends; not friends only, but familiar friends, indebted to them. Those banded with them should expel them from their country; those at peace should prevail against them in war; those who ate their bread should requite them with treachery. There is none understanding in him; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Edom. The shock of this defection of allies and the sudden destruction that has overwhelmed them have deprived the Edomites of their wonted sagacity and prudence. They know not whither to turn or what to do. The following verse expands this thought. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Aram-Damascus. - <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>.

And break in pieces the bolt of Damascus, and root out the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and the sceptre-holder out of Beth-eden: and the people of Aram will wander into captivity to Kir, saith Jehovah." In the formula, which is repeated in the case of every people, "for three transgressions, and for four," the numbers merely serve to denote the multiplicity of the sins, the exact number of which has no bearing upon the matter. "The number four is added to the number three, to characterize the latter as simply set down at pleasure; in other words, it is as much as to say that the number is not exactly three or four, but probably a still larger number" (Hitzig). The expression, therefore, denotes not a small but a large number of crimes, or "ungodliness in its worst form" (Luther; see at <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>)<p>(Note: J. Marck has correctly explained it thus: "When this perfect number (three) is followed by four, by way of gradation, God not only declares that the measure of iniquity is full, but that it is filled to overflowing and beyond all measure.").<p>That these numbers are to be understood in this way, and not to be taken in a literal sense, is unquestionably evident from the fact, that nit he more precise account of the sins which follows, as a rule, only one especially grievous crime is mentioned by way of example. &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; (I will not reverse it) is inserted before the more minute description of the crimes, to show that the threat is irrevocable. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; signifies to turn, i.e., to make a thing go back, to withdraw it, as in <a href="/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>. The suffix attached to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; refers neither to qo&#772;lo&#772; (his voice), nor "to the idea of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; which is implied in &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (thus saith), or the substance of the threatening thunder-voice" (Baur); for he&#772;sh&#305;&#772;bh da&#770;bha&#770;r signifies to give an answer, and never to make a word ineffectual. The reference is to the punishment threatened afterwards, where the masculine stands in the place of the neuter. Consequently the close of the verse contains the epexegesis of the first clause, and <a href="/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4</a> and <a href="/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a> follow with the explanation of &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493; (I will not turn it). The threshing of the Gileadites with iron threshing-machines is mentioned as the principal transgression of the Syrian kingdom, which is here named after the capital Damascus (see at <a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>). This took place at the conquest of the Israelitish land to the east of the Jordan by Hazael during the reign of Jehu (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>, cf. <a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>), when the conquerors acted so cruelly towards the Gileadites, that they even crushed the prisoners to pieces with iron threshing-machines, according to a barbarous war-custom that is met with elsewhere (see at <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>). Cha&#770;ru&#772;ts ( equals  cha&#770;r&#305;&#772;ts, <a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>), lit., sharpened, is a poetical term applied to the threshing-roller, or threshing-cart (mo&#772;rag cha&#770;ru&#772;ts, <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>). According to Jerome, it was "a kind of cart with toothed iron wheels underneath, which was driven about to crush the straw in the threshing-floors after the grain had been beaten out." The threat is individualized historically thus: in the case of the capital, the burning of the palaces is predicted; and in that of two other places, the destruction of the people and their rulers; so that both of them apply to both, or rather to the whole kingdom. The palaces of Hazael and Benhadad are to be sought for in Damascus, the capital of the kingdom (<a href="/jeremiah/49-27.htm">Jeremiah 49:27</a>). Hazael was the murderer of Benhadad I, to whom the prophet Elisha foretold that he would reign over Syria, and predicted the cruelties that he would practise towards Israel (<a href="/2_kings/8-7.htm">2 Kings 8:7</a>.). Benhadad is generally regarded as his son; but the plural "palaces" leads us rather to think of both the first and second Benhadad, and this is favoured by the circumstance that it was only during his father's reign that Benhadad II oppressed Israel, whereas after his death, and when he himself ascended the throne, the conquered provinces were wrested from him by Joash king of Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/13-22.htm">2 Kings 13:22-25</a>). The breaking of the bar (the bolt of the gate) denotes the conquest of the capital; and the cutting off of the inhabitants of Biq&#8219;ath-Aven indicates the slaughter connected with the capture of the towns, and not their deportation; for hikhr&#305;&#772;th means to exterminate, so that ga&#770;la&#770;h (captivity) in the last clause applies to the remainder of the population that had not been slain in war. In the parallel clause &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1498; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1501;, the sceptre-holder, i.e., the ruler (either the king or his deputy), corresponds to yo&#772;she&#772;bh (the inhabitant); and the thought expressed is, that both prince and people, both high and low, shall perish.<p>The two places, Valley-Aven and Beth-Eden, cannot be discovered with any certainty; but at any rate they were capitals, and possibly they may have been the seat of royal palaces as well as Damascus, which was the first capital of the kingdom. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, valley of nothingness, or of idols, is supposed by Ewald and Hitzig to be a name given to Heliopolis or Baalbek, after the analogy of Beth-aven  equals  Bethel (see at <a href="/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>). They base their opinion upon the Alex. rendering &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3a9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;, taken in connection with the Alex. interpretation of the Egyptian On (<a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>) as Heliopolis. But as the lxx have interpreted &#1488;&#1503; by Heliopolis in the book of Genesis, whereas here they have merely reproduced the Hebrew letters &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; by &#x3a9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;, as they have in other places as well (e.g., <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>, <a href="/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>), where Heliopolis cannot for a moment be thought of, the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3a9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; of the lxx furnishes no evidence in favour of Heliopolis, still less does it warrant an alteration of the Hebrew pointing (into &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;). Even the Chaldee and Syriac have taken &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; as a proper name, and Ephraem Syrus speaks of it as "a place in the neighbourhood of Damascus, distinguished for idol-chapels." The supposition that it is a city is also favoured by the analogy of the other threatenings, in which, for the most part, cities only are mentioned. Others understand by it the valley near Damascus, or the present Bekaa between Lebanon and Antilibanus, in which Heliopolis was always the most distinguished city, and Robinson has pronounced in favour of this (Bibl. Res. p. 677). Be&#772;th-&#8219;Eden, i.e., house of delight, is not to be sought for in the present village of Eden, on the eastern slope of Lebanon, near to the cedar forest of Bshirrai, as the Arabic name of this village 'hdn has nothing in common with the Hebrew &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; (see at <a href="/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a>); but it is the &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of the Greeks, which Ptolemy places ten degrees south and five degrees east of Laodicea, and which Robinson imagines that he has found in Old Jusieh, not far from Ribleh, a place belonging to the times before the Saracens, with very extensive ruins (see Bibl. Researches,  pp. 542-6, and 556). The rest of the population of Aram would be carried away to Kir, i.e., to the country on the banks of the river Kur, from which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>, the Syrians originally emigrated. This prediction was fulfilled when the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser conquered Damascus in the time of Ahaz, and broke up the kingdom of Syria (<a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>). The closing words, 'a&#770;mar Yeho&#772;va&#770;h (saith the Lord), serve to add strength to the threat, and therefore recur in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>, and <a href="/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>. </body></html>
