While the judgment is falling upon all the heathen nations, Mount Zion will be an asylum for all the Israelites who had fled for safety, and been scattered and dispersed.<p><span class= "bld">Holiness.</span>—See margin. Zion was once more to become a sanctuary, and those who inhabited it holy. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Their possessions.</span>—Whose—their own that had been lost, or those of the nations? The Vulgate, following the LXX., read “those who had possessed them,” indicating subjugation of the heathen tribes. But the parallelism is undoubtedly in favour of the other view—the remnant of Israel would be saved, and regain their old possessions. Having stated this, the prophet goes on to describe what would happen to Edom and its possessions.<p>(18) Though, in the preceding verse, “house of Jacob” would seem to embrace all the restored Israel, without any reference to the distinction of the two kingdoms, in this verse, being opposed to “house of Joseph,” it requires to be taken as synonymous with Judah; as in <a href="/isaiah/46-3.htm" title="Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:">Isaiah 46:3</a> : “Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel.” (Comp. <a href="/psalms/77-15.htm" title="You have with your arm redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.

Three divisions are enumerated of the house of Jacob (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Judah; see Note, <a href="/obadiah/1-18.htm" title="And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it.">Obadiah 1:18</a>), and separate mention made of Benjamin.<p><span class= "bld">They of the south.</span>—Those at present occupying the <span class= "ital">south</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">negev</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the <span class= "ital">dry parched</span> country forming the southern portion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-21.htm" title="And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,">Joshua 15:21</a>), are to inhabit Mount Esau: <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> are to extend their territory to its extreme south-eastern limit; they of the Shephelah, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the western lowland on the Mediterranean, are to seize on the neighbouring Philistia, at present Idumæan; while they at present confined to the hill-country in the north and centre of Judah are to spread themselves over Ephraim and Samaria. Our present Hebrew text leaves the subject of this latter clause uncertain, as it is in the Authorised Version “they.” But the LXX., <span class= "greekheb">τὸ ὄρος</span> indicates that <span class= "ital">hahor=</span>the mountain, has dropped out, a conjecture which is abundantly borne out by the geographical arrangement of the localities in the passage. Benjamin, for which no room is left on the west of Jordan, is to push across it into Gilead instead. This prophetic vision recalls <a href="/genesis/28-14.htm" title="And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 28:14</a>.<p>(20) But there are still others of the restored Israel, besides those comprised within the ancient territory of Judah. The prophetic survey proceeds northwards, and we get a general idea from this verse that there were exiles, who had found refuge on the north-western and northern boundaries of ancient Palestine, who would settle themselves partly on the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, partly in the south country, whose inhabitants had pushed downwards into Edom. But while this is plainly its general drift, the text is full of difficulties.<p>It is difficult to attach an intelligible meaning to “the captivity (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> exiles, <span class= "ital">galuth</span>; comp. <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm" title="So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.">Isaiah 20:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-13.htm" title="I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 45:13</a>) of this host of (literally, <span class= "ital">to</span>) the sons of Israel.”<p>The prophet seems to allude to some body of exiles, including himself, who had escaped from the army. But there is a difference of opinion among grammarians as to the identification of <span class= "ital">chël</span> with <span class= "ital">chayil</span> = host. Ewald takes it to be a dialectic variety of <span class= "ital">chol =</span> sand, generally of the sea-coast; and so here “the banished ones of <span class= "ital">this</span> coast,” where the prophet was at the time. The rendering <span class= "ital">chël=</span>trench, or fortification, which some adopt, is out of the question. The LXX. have <span class= "greekheb">τῆς μετοικεσίας ἡ ἀρχὴ</span>, but whether <span class= "greekheb">ἀρχὴ</span><span class= "ital"> = power</span>, or <span class= "ital">beginning,</span> with allusion to the first dispersion of exiles, cannot be determined. Another difficulty arises with respect to the words <span class= "ital">that of the Canaanites</span>—<span class= "ital">asher Khenaanîm</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">which Canaanites</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> To make it an object, as in our version, the particle <span class= "ital">eth</span> is wanted, and Ewald, instead of <span class= "ital">asher,</span> reads <span class= "ital">eth-ari = the cities of.</span> That some change has taken place in the text appears from the LXX., who have <span class= "greekheb">γῆ</span><span class= "ital">, the land</span> (Heb., <span class= "ital">erets</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Keil, keeping the present reading, renders, “And the captives of this army of the sons of Israel (will take possession) of what Canaanites there are as far as Zarephath . . .” Pusey: “And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel which are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath,” making it joint subject with “the captives of Jerusalem” to “shall possess the cities of the south,” which is in accordance with the construction of the LXX. and the Syriac. But the absence of the preposition <span class= "ital">be</span> before <span class= "ital">Khenaanim</span> seems to make this rendering impossible. The Hebrew as it stands can only mean “which are Canaanites.” The choice lies between Ewald’s emendation of the text and Keil’s interpretation. The Jews understand by Zarephath the country of <span class= "ital">France.</span><p>The last clause is better in the text than in the margin: “The exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall take possession of the cities of the south.” The only difficulty is in the name Sepharad, a place never mentioned elsewhere, and which has not yet been satisfactorily identified. The various conjectures have been—<p>1. That of the LXX., <span class= "greekheb">ἕως Ἐϕραθὰ</span> followed by the Arabic translation, probably from reading <span class= "ital">Sepharath.</span> Jerome, in his Commentary on Obadiah, appears to have understood this reading as pointing to the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Phrath,</span> since he translates, <span class= "ital">Transmigratio Jerusalem usque Euphratem.</span><p>2. The reading of the Vulg., <span class= "ital">quœ in Bosphoro est,</span> was derived by Jerome from a Jewish instructor, who treated the particle in <span class= "ital">Bisparad</span> as part of the name, and rejected the final <span class= "ital">d</span> altogether.<p>3. The Targum Jonathan, the Peshito-Syriac, and from them the modern Jews, interpret Sepharad as Spain (Ispamia or Ispania); hence <span class= "ital">Sephardim,</span> a name for the Spanish Jews.<p>4. Sipphara in Mesopotamia. But this is more probably identified with <span class= "ital">Sepharvaim.</span><p>5. Sardis, from a supposed connection with ÇPaRaD. or (Çparda, mentioned in the great arrow-headed inscription of Nakshi Rustam, in a list of names of tribes between Cappadocia and Ionia, which De Sacy identified with <span class= "ital">Sepharad</span>, and Lassen with <span class= "ital">Sardis.</span><p>6. Sparta. Some relations there were between the Jews after the captivity and the Lacedæmonians (see <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/12-2.htm" title="He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.">1 Maccabees 12:2</a>, <span class= "ital">seqq.,</span> 14:16, <span class= "ital">seqq.,</span> 15:23). Possibly there was a colony of the exiles in Sparta.<p>7. Ewald conjectures <span class= "ital">Sepharam</span> instead of <span class= "ital">Sepharad,</span> and finds the place in Shefa Amar, a well-known place a few miles south-east of Acco. The general drift of the passage seems to require some place not far distant from, and in the direction of, Zarephath. The only serious objection to this conjecture is the fact that Shefa Amar was within the boundaries of Palestine, and therefore those who had taken refuge there would not strictly be exiles. But it is distinctly stated that these were “of Jerusalem,” and they might well be called refugees, since they had had to go so far north to find an asylum.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Saviours.—</span>Comp. <a href="/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Judges 3:15</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-27.htm" title="Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.">Nehemiah 9:27</a>. The Jewish interpreters understood by “saviours” men like the judges of old, Gideon, Barak, &c., who will chastise the Christians and subdue them. The Mount of Esau is of course, according to this interpretation, Rome.<p><span class= "bld">And the kingdom shall be the Lord’s.—</span>See the reference in margin to Zechariah, who gives this anticipation of the pure form of the theocracy in its wider extent. But here, too, the prophetic look over the world seems to extend far beyond Judah and the fortunes of the Jewish race, and as the vision widens Zion and Edom both retire from sight; both are comprehended in the one Divine kingdom, and God is all in all. For the bearing of this conclusion to the prophecy on its date, see Excursus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/obadiah/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/obadiah/1-17.htm" title="But on mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions....">Obadiah 1:17-18</a>. </span><span class="ital">But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance — </span>Literally taken, this refers to the Jews; mystically, to the gospel church. By <span class="ital">deliverance </span>here may be first meant an asylum, or place of refuge, to escape the evil; and it may be spoken with a reference to the invasion of Judea by Sennacherib, and his being prevented by God from taking Jerusalem, (though he took all the other fenced cities of Judah,) so that all persons of the neighbouring places found a deliverance, or an asylum, there; and so escaped falling into the enemies’ hands. It may also, perhaps, chiefly refer to the restoration of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon. But yet this promise was more remarkably verified in the time of the first preaching of the gospel, when God’s <span class="ital">law </span>went <span class="ital">forth out of Zion, </span>and <span class="ital">the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, </span><a href="/psalms/100-2.htm" title="Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.">Psalm 100:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>; and when, through believing in Christ, and embracing the gospel, the Christians escaped the destruction that came upon the Jewish nation, concerning which see note on <a href="/joel/2-32.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD has said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.">Joel 2:32</a>.

Much of this prophecy was fulfilled when the Jews returned to their own land. But the salvation and holiness of the gospel, its spread, and the conversion of the Gentiles, seem also to be intended, especially the restoration of Israel, the destruction of antichrist, and the prosperous state of the church, to which all the prophets bear witness. When Christ is come, and not till then, shall the kingdom be the Lord's in the full sense of the term. As none that exalt themselves against the Lord shall prosper, and all shall be brought down; so none that wait upon the Lord, and put their trust in him, shall ever be dismayed.

In the triumph of the world, the lot was cast on Jerusalem, her sons were carried captive and slain, her holy places were desecrated. On the destruction of the nations, Mount Zion rises in calm majesty, as before; "a remnant" is replaced there, after its sifting; it is again "holiness;" not holy only, but a channel of holiness; "and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions (literally inherit their inheritances)"; either their own former possessions, receiving and "inheriting" from the enemy, what they had lost; or the "inheritances" of the nations. For the whole world is the inheritance of the Church, as Jesus said to the apostles, sons of Zion <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, "Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." and <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>, "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." Holiness is its title-deeds to the inheritance of the world, that holiness, which was in the "upper chamber" in "Mount Zion," the presence of God the Holy Spirit, issuing in holy teaching, holy Scriptures, holy institutions, holy sacraments, holy lives. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/obadiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. upon &#8230; Zion &#8230; deliverance&#8212;both in the literal sense and spiritual sense (Joe 2:32; Isa 46:13; 59:20; Ro 11:26).

Not only by Cyrus, at the end of the seventy years' captivity; and by the Maccabees from the Idumeans, and other enemies; but by the Messiah; for not merely temporal deliverance is here intended, unless as a shadow, type, and figure; but spiritual deliverance from the law, sin, Satan, the world, death, hell, and wrath to come, by Christ; who is the Deliverer that should both come to Zion and out of Zion, and who has wrought the above deliverance for Zion, his church and people; and where it is preached and proclaimed, and where those who are delivered come and dwell: or, "upon Mount Zion shall be an escape"; or, "they that escape" (b); the pollutions of the world, the vengeance of divine justice, the curses of the law, and the damnation of hell, by fleeing to Christ for refuge: <p>and there shall be holiness: that is, on Mount Zion, on the church, which is the holy hill of God, and where only holy persons should dwell; and for whomsoever deliverance is wrought out, sooner or later there will be in them holiness, both of heart and life; and indeed, without this, complete deliverance and salvation, which will be in heaven, will not be enjoyed; hence those that are chosen to this salvation are chosen through sanctification of the Spirit; and such as are redeemed and delivered by Christ are purified to be a peculiar people, zealous of good works; and are, in consequence of such deliverance and redemption, called with a holy calling, and have principles of holiness implanted in them, and live holy lives and conversations; and such kind of holiness, as it appeared in Zion, in the churches of Christ in the first times of the Gospel, so it will be more conspicuous among them in the latter day; see <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a> <a href="/zechariah/14-20.htm">Zechariah 14:20</a>; or, "there shall be an Holy One", or "thing" (c); the holy Jesus, who is holy in both his natures, in all his offices, works, and words; the Lamb that should, and has been, seen on Mount Zion; and the Holy Spirit of God, who dwells and abides in his church, and among his people, to anoint and assist the ministers of the word; to accompany the word with power, and make it successful; and to sanctify and comfort the Lord's people in Zion; and there are the holy word of God, the doctrines of grace according to godliness preached, and the sacred ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper administered. The Targum is, <p>"and they shall be holy;'' <p>the Lord's people: and so Kimchi interprets it of Israel being holy to the Lord; <p>and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions: that is, either the Israelites shall possess the possessions of the Heathens, particularly of the Edomites; so the Targum, <p>"and they of the house of Jacob shall possess the substance of the people that possessed them;'' <p>see <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>; which was fulfilled spiritually in the first times of the Gospel, when the apostles, who were of the house of Jacob, and were Israelites indeed, preached the Gospel to the Gentiles, and were the means of converting many of them, and of bringing them into the Gospel church; which may be called the house of Jacob, when they and theirs become their possession, and Christ, the master of this house, had the Heathen given him for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession, <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>; or else the sense is, that the people of God, true Christians, shall in Gospel times possess their own possessions; God himself, who is their portion and inheritance, and shall enjoy communion with him; Christ, and all that are his, all spiritual blessings in him; the Spirit and his graces, as the earnest of a future and eternal inheritance; exceeding great and precious promises they are heirs of, and a kingdom and glory hereafter; of which the possessions in the land of Canaan, restored to the right owners of them in the year of jubilee, were a type. R. Moses says this prophecy has respect to the times of Hezekiah; in which he is followed by Grotius, very wrongly; R. Jeshuah, better, to the times of the second temple; but Japhet, best of all, to time to come, to the times of the Messiah, to which it no doubt belongs: here begin the prophecies concerning Christ, his church, and kingdom. <p>(b)  "erit evasio", Vatablus, Piscator, Mercerus, Liveleus.

The Restoration of Israel<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By an easy transition the prophet passes to the second and brighter part of his picture. The destruction of her enemies is accompanied by the restoration and salvation of Israel. There is however no sudden break between the two portions of the prophecy. The key-note of deliverance had already been struck in the earlier portion by the implied promise (<span class="ital"><a href="/obadiah/1-16.htm" title="For as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.">Obadiah 1:16</a></span>) that the punishment of Israel was not to be, like that of her enemies, continual. The tones of vengeance are heard still in the later portion, and are only lost at length in the final strain of victory, “The kingdom shall be the Lord’s.” Israel is to regain her former possessions (<span class="ital"><a href="/obadiah/1-17.htm" title="But on mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.">Obadiah 1:17</a></span>), to overcome her ancient foes (<span class="ital"><a href="/obadiah/1-18.htm" title="And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it.">Obadiah 1:18</a></span>), to spread abroad in all directions (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/obadiah/1-19.htm" title="And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead....">Obadiah 1:19-20</a></span>), till as the ultimate issue which in the fulness of time shall be reached, God’s kingdom is set up in the world (<span class="ital"><a href="/obadiah/1-21.htm" title="And saviors shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.">Obadiah 1:21</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-21.</span> - Part II.

The Hebrew pronoun is ambiguous, and "their possessions" may mean either those that the Jews themselves had lost, or those of the Edomites. But nothing is said of Israel being carried away captive and losing its country; and, though the prophet may have looked forward to such a catastrophe and to a future restoration, this is not the subject here. The possessions referred to are those of the enemy represented by the Edomites, and those which the Jews had lost since the days of David and Solomon; and "the house of Jacob" signifies, not merely the earthly kingdom of Judah, but "the people of God, who are eventually to obtain the dominion of the world" (Keil); <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ammon. - <a href="/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>. "Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, and for four, I shall not reverse it, because they have ripped up the pregnant women of Gilead, to widen their border, <a href="/amos/1-14.htm">Amos 1:14</a>. I kindle fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it will devour its palaces, with the war-cry on the day of slaughter, in the storm on the day of the tempest. <a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes all at once, saith Jehovah." The occasion on which the Ammonites were guilty of such cruelty towards the Israelites as is here condemned, is not recorded in the historical books of the Old Testament; possibly during the wars of Hazael with Israel, when they availed themselves of the opportunity to widen their territory by conquering back the land which had been wrested from them by Sihon king of the Amorites, and was then taken possession of by the Israelites, when he was overcome by them, - a thing which they had attempted once before in the time of Jephthah the judge (<a href="/judges/11-12.htm">Judges 11:12</a>.). We may see from <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1</a>. that they had taken possession of the territory of the tribe of Gad, which lay nearest to them, though probably not till after the carrying away of the tribes beyond Jordan by the Assyrians (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). The ripping up of the women with child (see at <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>) is singled out as the climax of the cruelties which the Ammonites inflicted upon the Israelites during the war. As a punishment for this, their capital was to be burned, and the king, with the princes, to wander into exile, and consequently their kingdom was to be destroyed. Rabba&#770;h, i.e., the great one, is the abbreviated name of the capital; Rabbah of the children of Ammon, which has been preserved in the ruins of Aura&#770;n (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>). The threat is sharpened by the clause &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, at the war-cry on the field of battle, i.e., an actual fact, when the enemy shall take the city by storm. &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1506;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is a figurative expression applied to the storming of a city carried by assault, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; in <a href="/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14</a>. The reading &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;, "their (the Ammonites') king," is confirmed by the lxx and the Chaldee, and required by &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; (cf. <a href="/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>), whereas &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;, Melchom, which is found in Aq., Symm., Jerome, and the Syriac, rests upon a false interpretation. </body></html>
