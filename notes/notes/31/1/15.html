Its destruction seems to have been typical, as their father Esau's rejection; and to refer to the destruction of the enemies of the gospel church. See the prediction of the success of that war; Edom shall be spoiled, and brought down. All the enemies of God's church shall be disappointed in the things they stay themselves on. God can easily lay those low who magnify and exalt themselves; and will do it. Carnal security ripens men for ruin, and makes the ruin worse when it comes. Treasures on earth cannot be so safely laid up but that thieves may break through and steal; it is therefore our wisdom to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. Those that make flesh their trust, arm it against themselves. The God of our covenant will never deceive us: but if we trust men with whom we join ourselves, it may prove to us a wound and dishonour. God will justly deny those understanding to keep out of danger, who will not use their understandings to keep out of sin. All violence, all unrighteousness, is sin; but it makes the violence far worse, if it be done against any of God's people. Their barbarous conduct towards Judah and Jerusalem, is charged upon them. In reflecting on ourselves, it is good to consider what we should have done; to compare our practice with the Scripture rule. Sin, thus looked upon in the glass of the commandment, will appear exceedingly sinful. Those have a great deal to answer for, who are idle spectators of the troubles of their neighbours, when able to be active helpers. Those make themselves poor, who think to make themselves rich by the ruin of the people of God; and those deceive themselves, who call all that their own on which they can lay their hands in a day of calamity. Though judgment begins at the house of God, it shall not end there. Let sorrowful believers and insolent oppressors know, that the troubles of the righteous will soon end, but those of the wicked will be eternal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/obadiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the day of the Lord is near upon all the pagan - The prophet once more enforces his warning by preaching judgment to come. "The day of the Lord" was already known <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, as a day of judgment upon "all nations," in which God would "judge all the pagan," especially for their outrages against His people. Edom might hope to escape, were it alone threatened. The prophet announces one great law of God's retribution, one rule of His righteous judgment. "As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee." Pagan justice owned this to be just, and placed it in the mouth of their ideal of justice.  "Blessed he," says the Psalmist <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>, "that recompenses unto thee the deed which thou didst to us." "Blessed," because he was the instrument of God. Having laid down the rule of God's' judgment, he resumes his sentence to Edom, and speaks to all in him. In the day of Judahs calamity Edom made itself as "one of them." It, Jacob's brother, had ranked itself among the enemies of God's people. It then too should be swept away in one universal destruction. It takes its place with them, undistinguished in its doom as in its guilt, or it stands out as their representa tive, having the greater guilt, because it had the greater light. Obadiah, in adopting Joel's words <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-7.htm">Joel 3:7</a>, "thy reward shall return upon thine own head," pronounces therewith on Edom all those terrible judgments contained in the sentence of retribution as they had been expanded by Joel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/obadiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

This destruction of Edom here prophesied of, and of all the Heathen, was accomplished about five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, so that it might be truly said to be near; and some time within this space Obadiah seems to have prophesied; and the day of the Lord is not far off upon the Pagans, Mahometans, and all the "antichristian" states, When mystical Edom or Rome will be destroyed; see <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <p>as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy reward shall return upon thine own head; this is particularly directed to Edom, upon whom the day of the Lord's vengeance shall come; when he punished the Heathens, then the Edomites should be retaliated in their own way; and as they had rejoiced at the destruction of the Jews, and had insulted them in their calamities, and barbarously used them, they should be treated in like manner; see <a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>; and thus will mystical Babylon, or the mystical Edomites, be dealt with, even after the same manner as they have dealt with the truly godly, the faithful professors of Christ, <a href="/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/obadiah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the day <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> of the LORD <i>is</i> near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</span><p>(k) When he will summon all the heathen, and send them to destroy you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/obadiah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">The day of the Lord</span>] The order of the words, “for near is the day of the Lord,” accords with the fact that the day of the Lord is here spoken of as something already known and familiar. It was first revealed to the prophet Joel (<a href="/joel/1-15.htm" title="Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm" title="Blow you the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD comes, for it is near at hand;">Joel 2:1</a>; <a href="/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a> [Heb, 3:4]). There as here it had reference first to some nearer typical visitation and judgment, but included the great final day into which the prophet’s view here expands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as thou hast done</span>] comp. <a href="/ezekiel/35-15.htm" title="As you did rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you: you shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 35:15</a> and <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm" title="O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewards you as you have served us.">Psalm 137:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy reward</span>] rather, <span class="bld">thy work</span>; <span class="ital">dealing</span>, R.V. Comp. <a href="/joel/3-7.htm" title="Behold, I will raise them out of the place where you have sold them, and will return your recompense on your own head:">Joel 3:7</a> [Heb., 4:7].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">As ye have drunk</span>] This is commonly interpreted to mean, “As ye Edomites have drunk in triumphant revelry and carousal on my holy mountain, rejoicing with unhallowed joy over its destruction, so shall (ye and) all the nations drink continually the wine of God’s wrath and indignation.” But it is better to understand the first clause as referring to the Jews: “As ye have drunk (who are) upon my holy mountain; as even you, who are my chosen people and inhabit the mountain consecrated by my presence, have not escaped the cup of my wrath, so all the nations shall drink of that same cup, not with a passing salutary draught as you have done, but with a continuous swallowing down, till they have wrung out the dregs thereof and been brought to nothing by their consuming power.” The “drinking” is thus the same in both clauses and not as in the other interpretation, literal in the first clause, and figurative in the second. Thus too the word “continually” has its proper force, by virtue of the contrast which it suggests between the Jews, for whom the bitter draught was only temporary, for amendment and not for destruction, and the heathen who were to drink on till they perished. And this view of the words is strikingly confirmed by the parallel passages in Jeremiah. To that prophet the commission is given by God, “Take the wine cup of this fury at mine hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it.” Beginning with “Jerusalem and the cities of Judah” the prophet passes the cup in turn to Edom. And if the nations refuse to take the cup, he is to answer them by Obadiah’s argument that even God’s holy mountain has not escaped: “ye shall certainly drink. For do I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished?” (<a href="/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it....">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>). Again in the chapter in which, as we have seen, Jeremiah has much in common with Obadiah, he uses the figure of the cup of judgment with reference both to Jews and Edomites as though he had so understood it here. “Behold,” he says, “they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken, and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished?” <a href="/jeremiah/49-12.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and are you he that shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink of it.">Jeremiah 49:12</a>. And once more in the book of Lamentations he prophesies, “the cup also (of which we have drunk) shall pass through unto thee,” and then draws, in the following verse, the same contrast in plain language between the punishment of Israel and of Edom, which is here drawn by Obadiah by the figure of the single and the continuous draught. “The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity. He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins” (<a href="/context/jeremiah/4-21.htm" title="How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?...">Jeremiah 4:21-22</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15, 16</span>. After the description in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/obadiah/1-11.htm" title="In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them....">Obadiah 1:11-14</a></span>, of the fault for which Edom was to be punished, the prophet returns in these two verses to the subject of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/obadiah/1-2.htm" title="Behold, I have made you small among the heathen: you are greatly despised....">Obadiah 1:2-9</a></span>, and completes the description of the punishment that should be inflicted on him. He connects them by the word “for,” at once with the prediction of <span class="ital"><a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.">Obadiah 1:10</a></span>, “thou shalt be cut off for ever,” and with the earnest dissuasions of the verses that have followed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - &sect; 3. The warning given in the first section (vers, 1-9) is supplemented by the announcement <span class="accented">that in the day of the Lord, Edom and all the enemies of Israel shall be remembered, and shall suffer just retribution, meeting with the fate which they had inflicted on others.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The day of the Lord. This is not primarily the final day of judgment, but the time when "Jehovah reveals his majesty and omnipotence in a glorious manner, to overthrow all ungodly powers, and to complete his kingdom" (Keil). It is announced by <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 31</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>; but the notion of a judgment to fall on Gentile nations, and to issue in the establishment of the kingdom of God, was familiar long before. Balaam had seen it in dim vision (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17-24</a>); Hannah had anticipated the destruction that would accompany it (<a href="/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9, 10</a>); so had David (<a href="/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5-7</a>) in his last words; it is clearly predicted in the Psalms (see <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and 110.) (Knabenbauer). Is near. Because every such judgment upon individual nations is typical of the great day and preparative of it. As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee (comp. <a href="/judges/1-7.htm">Judges 1:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-15.htm">Jeremiah 50:15</a>). This law of retribution was the ideal of heathen justice, according to the Rhadamanthian rule, "If a man should suffer what he hath done, then there would be strict justice" (Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.' 5:5. 3). Thy reward (<a href="/joel/3-7.htm">Joel 3:7</a> [4:7, Hebrew]; better, <span class="accented">that which thou hast performed</span> - thy work or dealing, <span class="cmt_word">Upon thine own head.</span> Like a stone cast towards heaven (comp. <a href="/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>; <a href="/esther/9.htm">Esther 9</a>. '25). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Edom. - <a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>. "Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I shall not reverse it, because it pursues its brother with the sword, and stifles its compassion, and its anger tears in pieces for ever, and it keeps its wrath for ever, <a href="/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>. I send fire into Teman, and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah." Edom and the two following nations were related to Israel by lineal descent. In the case of Edom, Amos does not condemn any particular sins, but simply its implacable, mortal hatred towards its brother nation Israel, which broke out into acts of cruelty at every possible opportunity. &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514; &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, he annihilates, i.e., suppresses, stifles his sympathy or his compassionate love; this is still dependent upon &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1491;&#1508;&#1493;, the preposition &#1506;&#1500; continuing in force as a conjunction before the infinitive (i.e., as equivalent to &#1506;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;), and the infinitive passing into the finite verb (cf. <a href="/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a>). In the next clause &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493; is the subject: its wrath tears in pieces, i.e., rages destructively (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>, where ta&#770;raph is applied to the wrath of God). In the last clause, on the other hand, Edom is again the subject; but it is now regarded as a kingdom, and construed as a feminine, and consequently &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; is the object, and placed at the head as an absolute noun. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;, with the tone upon the penult. (milel) on account of netsach, which follows with the tone upon the first syllable, stands for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; (it preserves it), the mappik being omitted in the toneless syllable (compare Ewald, 249, b). If &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; were the subject, the verb would have to be pointed &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492;. Again, the rendering proposed by Ewald, "his fury lies in wait for ever," is precluded by the fact that &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, when applied to wrath in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-5.htm">Jeremiah 3:5</a>, signifies to keep, or preserve, and also by the fact that lying in wait is generally inapplicable to an emotion. Teman, according to Jerome (ad h. l.), is Idumaeorum regio quae vergit ad australem partem, so that here, just as in <a href="/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-5.htm">Amos 2:5</a>, the land is mentioned first, and then the capital.<p>(Note: It is true that, according to Eusebius, Jerome does also mention in the Onom. a villa (&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;) named Teman, which was five Roman miles from Petra, and in which there was a Roman garrison; and also that there is a Teman in Eastern Hauran (see Wetzstein in Delitzsch's Comm. on Job, i. 73); but in the Old Testament Teman is never to be understood as referring to a city.)<p>Bozrah, an important city, supposed to be the capital of Idumaea (see comm. on <a href="/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>). It was to the south of the Dead Sea, and has been preserved in el-Buseireh, a village with ruins in Jebl (see Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 570), and must not be confounded with Bossra in Hauran (Burckhardt, Syr. p. 364). </body></html>
