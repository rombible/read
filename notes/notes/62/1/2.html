That the apostle speaks of his eternity <span class="ital">a parte ante, </span>(as they say,) and as from everlasting, is evident, in that he speaks of him as he was in and from the beginning; when he was with the Father, before his manifestation to us; yea, before the making of all things that were made, as <a href="/context/john/1-2.htm" title="The same was in the beginning with God....">John 1:2-3</a>. So that he is the eternal, vital, intellectual Word and Son of the eternal, living Father. Now here was condescension and kindness indeed! that a person possessed of eternal, essential life, should put on flesh and blood, or the entire human nature; should assume infirmity, affliction, and mortality, in order to visit sinful mortals, to dwell among and converse with them; to reveal to them, procure for them, and then confer on them, eternal life; even felicity and glory unspeakable with himself for ever! <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 That essential Good, that uncreated Excellence, which had been from the beginning, from eternity, as equal with the Father, and which at length appeared in human nature for the salvation of sinners, was the great subject concerning which the apostle wrote to his brethren. The apostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, his miracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw him crucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touched him, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person, the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that he might be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through the redemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit. The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believers might share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had free access to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth in their souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communion of believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by the influences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are not like the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others; but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, so that any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say, that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to lead others to partake of the same blessedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the life was manifested - Was made manifest or visible unto us. He who was the life was made known to people by the incarnation. He appeared among people so that they could see him and hear him. Though originally with God, and dwelling with him, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, yet he came forth and appeared among people. Compare the <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a> note; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a> note. He is the great source of all life, and he appeared on the earth, and we had an opportunity of seeing and knowing what he was.<p>And we have seen it - This repetition, or turning over the thought, is designed to express the idea with emphasis, and is much in the manner of John. See <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>. He is particularly desirous of impressing on them the thought that he had been a personal witness of what the Saviour was, having had every opportunity of knowing it from long and familiar contact with him.<p>And bear witness - We testify in regard to it. John was satisfied that his own character was known to be such that credit would be given to what he said. He felt that he was known to be a man of truth, and hence he never doubts that faith would be put in all his statements. See <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; <a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-12.htm">3 John 1:12</a>.<p>And shew unto you that eternal life - That is, we declare unto you what that life was - what was the nature and rank of him who was the life, and how he appeared when on earth. He here attributes eternity to the Son of God - implying that he had always been with the Father.<p>Which was with the Father - Always before the manifestation on the earth. See <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. "The word was with God." This passage demonstrates the pre-existence of the Son of God, and proves that he was eternal. Before he was manifested on earth he had an existence to which the word life could be applied, and that was eternal. He is the Author of eternal life to us.<p>And was manifested unto us - In the flesh; as a man. He who was the life appeared unto people. The idea of John evidently is,<p>(1) that the Being here referred to was forever with God;<p>(2) that it was proper before the incarnation that the word life should be given to him as descriptive of his nature;<p>(3) that there was a manifestation of him who was thus called life, on earth; that he appeared among people; that he had a real existence here, and not a merely assumed appearance; and,<p>(4) that the true characteristics of this incarnate Being could be borne testimony to by those who had seen him, and who had been long with him. This second verse should be regarded as a parenthesis. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. the life&#8212;Jesus, "the Word of life."<p>was manifested&#8212;who had previously been "with the Father."<p>show&#8212;Translate as in 1Jo 1:3, "declare" (compare 1Jo 1:5).

That is, the Word of life, who is life itself, the fountain of life, having it as God, in and of himself, without derivation from, and independent of another, originally and eternally, and who is the cause, author, and giver of life in every sense to others; this living God, who from all eternity was invisible, was in the fulness of time manifested in human nature; see <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. <p>And we have seen it; as before with the eyes of their bodies: <p>and bear witness; for they were both eye and ear witnesses of the Word, and of the truth of his incarnation, and bore a faithful record to his proper deity, and real humanity: <p>and show unto you that eternal life; Jesus Christ, the true God, and eternal life, as in <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>; so called, because he has everlasting life in himself; as he is the living God, and because he has eternal life for all his people; not only the purpose and promise of it are in him, but the thing itself; and it is in his power and gift to bestow it on all the Father hath given to him, and to them he does give it. The beginning of it lies in the knowledge of him, and the consummation of it will be in the lasting vision and enjoyment of him: <p>which was with the Father; that is, which life, eternal life, and Word of life, was from the beginning, or from all eternity with God the Father; which phrase is expressive of the eternal existence of Christ, as the Word and Son of God, with his Father, his relation to him, his oneness in nature, and equality with him, and his personal distinction from him; see <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <p>and was manifested unto us; in human nature, as before observed, and that to the apostles, as he was not to the patriarchs and prophets; for though they saw him in promise, in prophecy, in type, and figure, and he sometimes appeared in an human form for a short time to them, yet they did not see him incarnate, in actual union with human nature; nor had they him dwelling among them, and conversing with them, as the apostles had; this was an happiness peculiar to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">(For the life was manifested, and we have seen <i>it</i>, and bear witness, and <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)</span><p>(c) Being sent by him: and that doctrine is correctly said to be shown, for no man could so much as have thought of it, if it had not been thus shown.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>.

It is true, the idea <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΩῊ ΑἸΏΝΙΟς</span></span></span> has elsewhere in the N. T. admittedly another signification, but this does not justify the explanation of Calvin: ubi secundo repetit: annuntiamus vitam aeternam, non dubito quin de effectu loquatur, nempe quod annuntiet: beneficio Christi partam nobis esse vitam. De Wette’s explanation also, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΖΩῊ Ἡ ΑἸΏΝΙΟς</span></span></span> is an idea “which hovers in the middle between the eternal true life which is to be appropriated by believers (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>), and life in Christ, so that the first is to be considered in closest connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΑΓΓΈΛΛΟΜΕΝ</span></span></span>, but the second in reference to the reflexive <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἭΤΙς ἮΝ</span></span></span>,” can so much the less be held correct as the simple and clear thought of the apostle is thereby rendered complicated and obscure.

Quite erroneously, Socin, Grotius, and others understand the expression of the concealment of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΩῊ ΑἸΏΝ</span></span></span>. in the decree of God. From the fact that John here calls God in His relation to Christ <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΤΉΡ</span></span></span>, it follows that the sonship of Christ to God is to be regarded not as first begun with His incarnation, but as premundane.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΦΑΝΕΡΏΘΗ ἩΜῖΝ</span></span></span>] is not a mere repetition of what has been already said, but in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜῖΝ</span></span></span> a new element is added, by which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΩΡΆΚΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὃ ἈΚΗΚΌΑΜΕΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a>, find their explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] Ebrard wrongly conceives the logical relation thus, that by <span class="greekheb">καί</span> the thought that is latent in the preceding verse: “that Christ was of eternal being, but became incarnate and was manifested,” is <span class="ital">confirmed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[37] </span>Groundlessly Baumgarten-Crusius asserts that <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> “has here more inner, spiritual meaning than in Gospel <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>;” this is to mistake the meaning which the word has in that passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[38] The chief elements which are contained in the idea <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> are differently stated by the commentators; Frommann mentions as such: “the truth, perfection, or the living and happy character of being;” Köstlin: “the mightiness, blessedness, and endlessness of being.” If we keep to the scriptural mode of conception, the chief elements appear to be “consciousness, activity, and happiness;” true activity is only where consciousness is, and happiness is activity which is not disturbed or hindered by any opposition.—Weiss wrongly infers from <a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>, that by <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> is to be understood only the knowledge of God, and it is erroneous for him to maintain that <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωή</span> does not here signify Christ Himself, but “His peculiar knowledge of God,” which He possessed even before His <span class="greekheb">φανέρωσις</span>. The relative clause <span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἦν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα</span>, which is connected with <span class="greekheb">τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον</span>, is opposed to this interpretation; inasmuch as it shows that here <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωὴ ἡ αἰώνιος</span>, and just as much <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζωή</span>, is to be considered as the same subject which John in the prooemium of the Gospel calls <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span>, and of which he says there that it <span class="greekheb">ἦν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[39] Incorrectly a Lapide: quasi martyres i.e. testes Dei tum voce, tum vita, tum <span class="ital">passione, morte</span> et <span class="ital">martyrio.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[40] </span>Bengel’s interpretation: “<span class="ital">Testimonium</span>, genus; species duae: <span class="ital">annuntiatio</span> et <span class="ital">Scriptio; annuntiatio</span> ponit fundamentum, <span class="ital">scriptio</span> superaedificat,” is inadmissible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[41] The statement of Ebrard is inapposite, that by <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> the subject-matter of the relative clause is stated as an already (from ver. 1) <span class="ital">known and at the same time acknowledged</span> element of the substantive idea on which the relative clause depends. The right view seems to lie at the base of the explanation of Sander: “I declare unto you eternal life, <span class="ital">even</span> as <span class="ital">such</span> as,” etc., at least it is not touched at by the remark of Ebrard in opposition: “The meaning of John is plainly this, that the <span class="greekheb">ζ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span>. is really and in itself one which was with the Father and was manifested to us, and is by no means represented as such merely in the proclamation of it.” Düsterdieck rightly says: “By <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> the twofold extension of the predicate is connected with the subject <span class="greekheb">ἡ ζ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ αἰών</span>., not merely in simply relative manner, but in such a way that the extension of the predicate contains at the same time an explanatory and confirmatory reference;” but it is difficult to admit that by virtue of <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐφανερώθη ἡμῖν</span> in its close connection with <span class="greekheb">ἦν πρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατ</span>. is marked as the connecting link which unites to <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἦν ἀπʼ ἀρχ</span>. the accessory elements <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἀκηκόαμεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[42] Besser: “The Word was with God, related to the Father in <span class="ital">filial love.</span>” Still less justifiable is Ebrard’s explanation: “The <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> was a life flowing forth indeed from the bosom of the Father, but immediately returning into it, floating in the inner circulation of the life of God.” (!)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>.

It is S. John’s characteristic use of the simple conjunction. ‘Manifest’ (<span class="greekheb">φανεροῦν</span>) also is one of S. John’s characteristic words, frequent in Gospel and Epistle and occurring twice in Revelation. Words and phrases which connect the Epistle with the Gospel, or either of these with the Apocalypse, should be carefully noted. ‘Was manifested’ means became such that He could be known by man. Note that the sentence does not begin with a relative, ‘which was manifested’, but that the noun is repeated. This repetition, carrying on a part of one sentence into the next for further elucidation and development, is quite in S. John’s style.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have seen</span>] This is the result of the manifestation: the Divine Life has become perceptible by the senses.

John’s style; and ‘bear witness’ (<span class="greekheb">μαρτυρεῖν</span>) is another of his favourite words, occurring frequently in Gospel, Epistle, and Apocalypse. Testimony to the truth, with a view to producing belief in the Truth, on which eternal life depends, is one of his frequent thoughts. But the frequency of ‘bear witness’ in his writings is much obscured in A. V., where the same verb is sometimes rendered ‘bear record’ (<a href="/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1 John 5:7</a>), ‘give record’ (<a href="/1_john/5-10.htm" title="He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.">1 John 5:10</a>), and ‘testify’ (<a href="/1_john/4-14.htm" title="And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.">1 John 4:14</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-9.htm" title="If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.">1 John 5:9</a>), and so also in the Gospel and the Revelation. Similarly the substantive ‘witness’ (<span class="greekheb">μαρτυρία</span>) is sometimes translated ‘record’ (<a href="/context/1_john/5-10.htm" title="He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son....">1 John 5:10-11</a>) and sometimes ‘testimony’. The R.V. in this respect has made great improvements. Comp. ‘This Jesus did God raise up, whereof (or, of whom) <span class="ital">we all are witnesses</span>’ (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm" title="This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.">Acts 2:32</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shew unto you</span>] Better, <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">declare</span> <span class="ital">unto you</span>: it is the same verb as occurs in the next verse; rare in S. John (<a href="/john/16-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.">John 16:25</a>, but not <a href="/john/4-51.htm" title="And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives.">John 4:51</a> or <a href="/john/20-18.htm" title="Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things to her.">John 20:18</a>) but frequent in S.

In this parenthetical verse, as in the main sentence of <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a></span>, the Apostle emphatically reiterates that what he has to communicate is the result of his own personal experience. ‘He that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe’ (<a href="/john/19-35.htm" title="And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.">John 19:35</a> : comp. <a href="/context/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:...">John 20:30-31</a>, <a href="/john/21-24.htm" title="This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.">John 21:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that eternal life</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">life</span>, <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">eternal</span> (<span class="ital">life</span>). “The repetition of the article brings forward separately and distinctly the two notions of life and eternity” (Jelf).

And he answered, No.">John 1:21</a>; <a href="/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>; <a href="/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14</a>; <a href="/john/6-48.htm" title="I am that bread of life.">John 6:48</a>; <a href="/john/6-69.htm" title="And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.">John 6:69</a>; <a href="/john/7-40.htm" title="Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.">John 7:40</a>). For ‘the Life’ as a name for Christ comp. ‘I am the Resurrection and the Life’: ‘I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life’ (<a href="/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>; <a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>). ‘Eternal life’ is another of S. John’s characteristic phrases, a fact somewhat obliterated in A.V. by the Greek phrase being often rendered ‘everlasting life’ or ‘life everlasting’. ‘Eternal’ is better than ‘everlasting’, although in popular language the two words are synonymous. S. John’s ‘eternal life’ has nothing to do with time, but depends on our relation to Jesus Christ. S. John tells us over and over again that eternal life can be possessed in this world (<a href="/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1 John 5:11</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.">1 John 5:20</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a> : see on <a href="/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47</a>). He never applies ‘eternal’ (<span class="greekheb">αἰώνιος</span>) to anything but life, excepting in <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm" title="And I saw another angel fly in the middle of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,">Revelation 14:6</a>, where he speaks of an ‘eternal gospel’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which was with the Father</span>] Or, <span class="ital">which indeed was with the Father</span>: it is not the simple but compound relative, denoting that what follows is a special attribute; ‘which was <span class="ital">such as to be</span> with the Father’. For the ‘was’ see on <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a></span>. ‘With the Father’ is exactly parallel to ‘with God’ in <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. It is anticipated in the passage on the Divine Wisdom; ‘Then I was by Him as one brought up with Him’ (<a href="/proverbs/8-30.htm" title="Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;">Proverbs 8:30</a>). It indicates the distinct Personality of ‘the Life’. Had the Apostle written ‘which was <span class="ital">in</span> God’, we might have thought that he meant a mere attribute of God. ‘With the Father’ is <span class="ital">apud Patrem</span>, ‘face to face’ or ‘at home with the Father’. Comp. ‘to tarry a while <span class="ital">with</span> you’ (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-7.htm" title="For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>); ‘when we were <span class="ital">with</span> you’ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>); ‘whom I would fain have kept <span class="ital">with</span> me’ (<a href="/philemon/1-13.htm" title="Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:">Philemon 1:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">was manifested unto us</span>] Repeated from the beginning of the verse. In both cases we have a change from the imperfect tense (of the continuous preexistence of Christ) to the aorist (of the comparatively momentary manifestation). But S. John’s repetitions generally carry us a step further. The manifestation would be little to us, if we had no share in it. But that Being who was from all eternity with the Father, has been made known, and made known <span class="ital">to us</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐφανερώθη</span>, <span class="ital">was manifested</span>) gave Himself in the flesh to our eyes, ears, and hands: <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>.

The main thought of verses 1 and 3 is, "We declare to you a Being both eternal and yet seen and known by us." That of verse 2 is, "This Being, in his character of the Life, became visible, and in him are centered all the relations between God and man." Quite in St. John's style, verse 2 takes up and develops a portion of verse 1, using its last word as the basis of a new departure (comp. <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> gives the same fact as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> from another point of view). <span class="cmt_word">Became flesh</span> is the fact in itself; the incarnation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. "Was manifested" is the fact in reference to mankind; their admission to the knowledge of it. The union of "see" with "bear witness" recalls <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; and here, again, verse 2 resumes and develops part of verse 1. <span class="cmt_word">Have seen</span> sums up the four verbs in verse 1; for in all languages sight is used of experience generally. <span class="cmt_word">Bear witness and declare</span> carries us a stage further - the communication of the experience.

Corresponding with the Word was made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The two phrases, however, present different aspects of the same truth. The Word became flesh, contemplates simply the historic fact of incarnation. The life was manifested, sets forth the unfolding of that fact in the various operations of life. The one denotes the objective process of the incarnation as such, the other the result of that process as related to human capacity of receiving and understanding it. "The reality of the incarnation would be undeclared if it were said, 'The Life became flesh.' The manifestation of the Life was a consequence of the incarnation of the Word, but it is not coextensive with it" (Westcott).<p>Have seen - bear witness - shew<p>Three ideas in the apostolic message: experience, testimony, announcement.<p>Bear witness<p>See on <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>.<p>Shew (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, as Rev., declare.
