There is a joy of faith, a joy of hope, and a joy of love.

The apostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, his miracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw him crucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touched him, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person, the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that he might be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through the redemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit. The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believers might share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had free access to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth in their souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communion of believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by the influences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are not like the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others; but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, so that any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say, that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to lead others to partake of the same blessedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you - We announce it, or make it known unto you - referring either to what he purposes to say in this Epistle, or more probably embracing all that he had written respecting him, and supposing that his Gospel was in their hands. He means to call their attention to all the testimony which he had borne on the subject, in order to counteract the errors which began to prevail.<p>That ye may have fellowship with us - With us the apostles; with us who actually saw him, and conversed with him. That is, he wished that they might have the same belief, and the same hope, and the same joy which he himself had, arising from the fact that the Son of God had become incarnate, and had appeared among people. To "have fellowship," means to have anything in common with others; to partake of it; to share it with them, (see the notes at <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>); and the idea here is, that the apostle wished that they might share with him all the peace and happiness which resulted from the fact that the Son of God had appeared in human form in behalf of men. The object of the apostle in what he wrote was, that they might have the same views of the Saviour which he had, and partake of the same hope and joy. This is the true notion of fellowship in religion.<p>And truly our fellowship is with the Father - With God the Father. That is, there was something in common with him and God; something of which he and God partook together, or which they shared. This cannot, of course, mean that his nature was the same as that of God, or that in all things he shared with God, or that in anything he was equal with God; but it means that he partook, in some respects, of the feelings, the views, the aims, the joys which God has. There was a union in feeling, and affection, and desire, and plan, and this was to him a source of joy. He had an attachment to the same things, loved the same truth, desired the same objects, and was engaged in the same work; and the consciousness of this, and the joy which attended it, was what was meant by fellowship. Compare the <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a> note; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a> note. The fellowship which Christians have with God relates to the following points:<p>(1) Attachment to the same truths, and the same objects; love for the same principles, and the same beings.<p>(2) the same kind of happiness, though not in the same degree. The happiness of God is found in holiness, truth, purity, justice, mercy, benevolence. The happiness of the Christian is of the same kind that God has; the same kind that angels have; the same kind that he will himself have in heaven - for the joy of heaven is only that which the Christian has now, expanded to the utmost capacity of the soul, and freed from all that now interferes with it, and prolonged to eternity.<p>(3) Employment, or cooperation with God. There is a sphere in which God works alone, and in which we can have no cooperation, no fellowship with him. In the work of creation; in upholding all things; in the government of the universe; in the transmission of light from world to world; in the return of the seasons, the rising and setting of the sun, the storms, the tides, the flight of the comet, we can have no joint agency, no cooperation with him. There God works alone. But there is also a large sphere in which he admits us graciously to a cooperation with him, and in which, unless we work, his agency will not be put forth. This is seen when the farmer sows his grain; when the surgeon binds up a wound; when we take the medicine which God has appointed as a means of restoration to health. So in the moral world. In our efforts to save our own souls and the souls of others, God graciously works with us; and unless we work, the object is not accomplished. This cooperation is referred to in such passages as these: "We are laborers together (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  sunergoi) with God," <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>. "The Lord working with them," <a href="/mark/16-20.htm">Mark 16:20</a>. "We then as workers together with him," <a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>. "That we might be fellow-helpers to the truth," <a href="/3_john/1-8.htm">3 John 1:8</a>. In all such cases, while the efficiency is of God - alike in exciting us to effort, and in crowning the effort with success - it is still true that if our efforts were not put forth, the work would not be done. In this department God would not work by himself alone; he would not secure the result by miracle.<p>(4) we have fellowship with God by direct communion with him, in prayer, in meditation, and in the ordinances of religion. Of this all true Christians are sensible, and this constitutes no small part of their special joy. The nature of this, and the happiness resulting from it, is much of the same nature as the communion of friend with friend - of one mind with another kindred mind - that to which we owe no small part of our happiness in this world.<p>(5) the Christian will have fellowship with his God and Saviour in the triumphs of the latter day, when the scenes of the judgment shall occur, and when the Redeemer shall appear, that he may be admired and adored by assembled worlds. Compare the notes at <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:10</a>. See also <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>.<p>And with his Son Jesus Christ - That is, in like manner there is much which we have in common with the Saviour - in character, in feeling, in desire, in spirit, in plan. There is a union with him in these things - and the consciousness of this gives peace and joy.<p>(There is a real union between Christ and his people, which lies at the foundation of this fellowship. Without this union there can be no communion. But a "union with Christ in these things, i. e., in character and feeling, etc." is nothing more than the union which subsists between any chief and his followers; and why the apostle Paul, or others after him, should reckon this a great mystery, is not easily comprehended. <a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>.

Faith realizes what we have not seen as spiritually visible; not till by faith we too have seen, do we know all the excellency of the true Solomon. He Himself is ours; He in us and we in Him. We are "partakers of the divine nature." We know God only by having fellowship with Him; He may thus be known, but not comprehended. The repetition of "with" before the "Son," distinguishes the persons, while the fellowship or communion with both Father and Son, implies their unity. It is not added "and with the Holy Ghost"; for it is by the Holy Ghost or Spirit of the Father and Son in us, that we are enabled to have fellowship with the Father and Son (compare 1Jo 3:24). Believers enjoy the fellowship OF, but not WITH, the Holy Ghost.

And this declaration of him is made in the Gospel, for the following ends and purposes, <p>that ye also may have fellowship with us; in hearing, seeing, and handling of Christ in a spiritual sense; and by enjoying the same privileges in God's house and family, the same ordinances and spiritual provisions; joining and partaking with them in all the immunities and advantages of a Gospel church state here; and by being with them to all eternity hereafter. <p>And truly our fellowship is with the Father; the Father of Christ, the covenant God and Father of his people; and which they have with him, when under the influence and witnessings of the spirit of adoption, and can in the strength of faith call him their Father, draw nigh to him through Christ as such, and are indulged with his presence, and the discoveries of his love: <p>and with his Son Jesus Christ; being in union to him, they become partakers of him, and of his blessings; they receive out of his fulness, and grace for grace; they are admitted to an intimacy and familiarity with him; they are had into his chambers of secret retirement; they are brought into his banqueting house, where his banner over them is love, and where he sups with them, and they with him; and into this fellowship are they called by the grace of God, through the Gospel; as also they have fellowship with the blessed Spirit, though not here mentioned; see <a href="/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship <i>is</i> with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</span><p>(2) The use of this doctrine is this, that all of us being coupled and joined together with Christ by faith, might become the sons of God: in which only consists all true happiness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>. In the opening words of this verse: <span class="greekheb">ὃ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀκηκόαμεν</span>, the object expressed in <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a> is resumed, and the governing verb, which was there already in the apostle’s view, is added. The drift of this verse does not, however, lie in this, but rather in the final clause: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. While John first meant to state what was the subject of his proclamation, namely, that it was that which was from the beginning and was perceived by his senses,—which he then more particularly defined in <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>,—he now wants to state the <span class="ital">purpose</span> of this proclamation of that subject. In this lies the reason why the object is resumed in abridged form, namely, in the form which the immediately preceding words (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐφανερώθη ἡμῖν</span>) suggested. The <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἦν ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span>, and similarly the <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐθεασάμεθα</span>, was not to be resumed; the former, because it has been fully dealt with in what follows it; the latter, because it was not here in the purpose of the apostle once more to bring out the reality of the sensuous appearance of Him who was from the beginning. That <span class="greekheb">ἑωράκαμεν</span> is placed before <span class="greekheb">ἀκηκόαμεν</span>—in which no artificial parallelism is to be sought for (against Ebrard)—resulted naturally from the interweaving of <span class="greekheb">ἑωράκαμεν</span> into <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a> (de Wette).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπαγγέλλομεν καὶ ὑμῖν</span>] with <span class="greekheb">ἀπαγγέλλομεν</span>, comp. <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καί</span> (see the critical remarks) distinguishes the readers either from others to whom the apostle had declared the same thing (Spener, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Lücke, Düsterdieck, Myrberg, Braune, etc.), or from John (along with the other apostles). Lorinus: vos qui nimirum non audistis, nec vidistis, nec manibus vestris contrectastis verbum vitae; so also Zwingli, Bullinger, Ebrard. The latter interpretation would be preferable, if the following <span class="greekheb">καί</span> before <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, to which the same reference is to be attributed, did not thereby become pleonastic.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα καὶ ὑμεῖς κοινωνίαν ἔχητε μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span>] Many commentators, as Socin, Bengel, Russmeyer, Spener, and others, supply with <span class="greekheb">κοινωνίαν</span> as enlargement: “with God and Christ;” without adequate ground; the enlargement of the idea <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> is <span class="greekheb">μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span> (Baumgarten-Crusius, Düsterdieck, Braune), whereby, however, John does not mean “the apostles and other Christians” (de Wette), but himself, although including the other apostles, who have also seen and heard the Word of Life. This <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> is self-evidently the fellowship of spirit in faith and love, which was brought about by the apostolic preaching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔχειν</span> is neither to be explained, with a Lapide, by: pergere et in ea (<span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>) proficere et confirmari, nor, with Fritzsche, by: “to acquire;” the word is rather to be retained in the signification peculiar to it; the apostle simply indicates the <span class="ital">having</span> fellowship as the aim of the apostolic proclamation, quite apart from the question as to how the hearers of this are related to that.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ κοινωνία δὲ ἡ ἡμετέρα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] By <span class="greekheb">ἡ κοινωνία ἡ ἡμετέρα</span> most commentators understand “the fellowship which the apostles and the believing hearers of their proclamation have <span class="ital">with one another</span>,” and, according as <span class="greekheb">ᾖ</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> is supplied, have thus defined the thought of the verse, that the apostle states of this mutual fellowship that it either should be or is a fellowship with the Father and the Son. But as this view necessitates a scarcely justifiable enlargement of the idea <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἡ κοινωνία ἡ ἡμετέρα ᾖ</span> [or <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>] <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία μετὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.),[43] the explanation of Baumgarten-Crusius, who resolves <span class="greekheb">ἡ κοιν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἡμετέρα</span> into <span class="greekheb">ἡμεις ἔχομεν κοινωνίαν μετὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατρ</span>., deserves the preference (so also Ewald, Braune); taking this explanation, the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> meant here is not identical with that mentioned before, inasmuch as the distinction is marked both by the difference of the subject: <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> (which is contained in <span class="greekheb">ἡμετέρα</span>), and that of the object: <span class="greekheb">μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">μετὰ τοῦ πατρός</span>. According to this acceptation, the apostle here brings out that he (along with the rest of the apostles) has fellowship with the Father and with the Son, and, no doubt, in order to intimate by this that his readers, if they have fellowship with him, are thereby received with him into that fellowship. It is at all events incorrect, with Augustin, Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Ebrard, etc., to supply <span class="greekheb">ᾖ</span> with this sentence. In opposition to it are—(1) the structure of the sentence, for if it were dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> the verb could not be omitted;[44] and (2) the thought, for as the apostles are already in fellowship with the Father and with the Son, it cannot be the aim of their <span class="greekheb">ἀπαγγελία</span> to elevate the fellowship which exists between them and those who accept their word into fellowship with the Father and with the Son. Therefore it is <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> that must be supplied, as Erasmus, a Lapide, Vatablus, Hornejus, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Düsterdieck, Myrberg, Ewald Braune, etc., have rightly recognised. The conjunction <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, which is pretty often found in the N. T., is used when the idea which is <span class="ital">connected</span> with a preceding one is at the same time to be <span class="ital">contrasted</span> with it; “the introduction of <span class="ital">something new</span> is thereby intimated” (Pape, see on <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>). Whether it be the connection or the contrast which is to be the more emphasized, this particle is never used to resume an idea with the view to a further expression of it. This usage therefore also proves that by <span class="greekheb">ἡ κοιν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἡμετέρα</span> it is not the previously mentioned <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span>, but another fellowship, namely, the fellowship of the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of John and the other apostles (not with one another, but) with the Father and with the Son, that is meant.[45] God is here called <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΤΉΡ</span></span></span> in relation to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ΥἹΟῦ ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The full description of Christ as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ΥἹΟῦ ΑὐΤΟῦ ἸΗΣΟῦ ΧΡΙΣΤΟῦ</span></span></span> serves to bring out the identity of that which was from the beginning with Him who became man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[43] This enlargement is involuntarily made by the commentators—although they do not mention it; thus by Lücke, when he explains: “that ye may have fellowship with us: but (not with us only, but—ye know) our fellowship with one another is also <span class="ital">that</span> with the Father and with the Son;” similarly by Düsterdieck; Ebrard also says: “It is the purpose of John in his <span class="greekheb">ἀπαγγελία</span>, that his readers may enter into fellowship with the disciples, and that this fellowship may have its life-principle in the <span class="ital">fellowship</span> with the Father and with the Son.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[44] The omission of <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> very often occurs; on the other hand, <span class="greekheb">ᾖ</span> is <span class="ital">very seldom</span> omitted in the N.

Lücke wrongly says that the particle is used for the more exact definition, expansion, and strengthening of a preceding thought, and that there is contained in it an “<span class="ital">at the same time</span>” or “<span class="ital">not only … but also.</span>” It must also be held as erroneous when Düsterdieck says: “John has just spoken of a ‘fellowship with us;’ now he wants to expand <span class="ital">this</span> idea further; therefore he continues: ‘and <span class="ital">our</span> fellowship’—the new explanatory thought, however, forms a certain antithesis to what was previously said: but <span class="ital">our</span> fellowship is not so much the fellowship with <span class="ital">us</span> as rather that with the Father and with the Son.”—Apart from the fact that <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> has not the force of such a restriction (not so much … as rather), who does not feel that, if John wanted to express this thought, he would have had to write not <span class="greekheb">ἡμετέρα</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὑμετέρα</span>, or rather: <span class="greekheb">αὕτη δὲ κεινωεία</span>?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐωρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀκ</span>., not merely a resumption but a reiteration of the protasis. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>, “ye also” who have not seen Jesus. <span class="greekheb">κοινωνίαν</span>, not merely knowledge through hearsay of what the Apostles had known as eye-witnesses, but personal and direct communion with the living Lord.

Parallels between the two abound: in what follows we have a striking one. Note the sequence of ideas: 1. the <span class="ital">evidence</span> on which their conviction was based, ‘have seen’; 2. their declaration of these convictions as <span class="ital">Apostles</span>, ‘bear witness’; 3. their declaration of them as <span class="ital">Evangelists</span>, ‘declare’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that ye also may have fellowship with us</span>] Comp. ‘that they may be one, even as We are’ (<a href="/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you.

The word is rare in N. T. outside S. Paul’s writings. It “generally denotes the fellowship of persons with persons in one and the same object, always common to all and sometimes whole to each” (Canon Evans on <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>). This is S. John’s conception of the Church: each member of it possesses the Son, and through Him the Father; and this common possession gives communion with all other members as well as with the Divine Persons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and truly our fellowship</span>] Or, <span class="ital">yea, and our fellowship</span>: there is a double conjunction in the Greek, as in <a href="/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a>.

Comp. ‘God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the <span class="ital">fellowship of His Son</span> Jesus Christ our Lord’ (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The fulness of the expression (comp. <a href="/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a>) is not so apparent in the English as in the Greek, which literally rendered runs thus; <span class="ital">is with the Father and with the Son of Him, Jesus Christ</span>. Both the preposition and the definite article are repeated, marking emphatically the distinction and equality between the Son and the Father. Thus two fundamental truths, which the philosophical heresies of the age were apt to obscure or deny, are here clearly laid down at the outset; (1) the distinctness of personality and equality of dignity between the Father and the Son; (2) the identity of the eternal Son of God with the historical person Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀκηκόαμεν</span>, <span class="ital">we have heard</span>) This is now put after sight, because the declaration is principally from hearing.—<span class="greekheb">κοινωνίαν</span>—<span class="greekheb">μεθʼ ἠμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">communion—with us</span>) the same which we have <span class="ital">who have seen</span>.—<span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>) that is <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>. <span class="ital">Communion</span>, so that He Himself is ours; He in us, and we in Him.—<span class="greekheb">μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς</span>, <span class="ital">with the Father</span>) who sent the Son, <a href="/context/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full....">1 John 1:4-10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μετὰ τοῦ ὑιοῦ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">with His Son</span>) whom the Father sent: ch. <a href="/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

To what does it refer? Not to this Epistle, which does not contain the writer's experience of the Word of life manifested to mankind, but to his Gospel, which the Epistle is to accompany. The parallel between the two writings must often be noted, especially between the Epistle and <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>. Compare this verse with <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>. St. John's aim in writing his Gospel is that the great High Priest's prayer may be fulfilled - that believers may be one in that communion of which the unity between the Father and the Son is the pattern and the basis; may "be joined together in the same body, the same belief, the same knowledge, the same sins, the same hopes, the same destinies" (Jelf). Communion with Christians is shown to mean a great deal - no less than communion with the Father and with the Son. Note the double <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> St. John's writings teem with indications of the unity and yet distinctness between the Father and the Son. Communion with the one, so far from absorbing and canceling communion with the other, implies it as a separate bliss.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>, the climax advanced from the lower evidence of hearing to that of sight. Here, in recapitulating, the process is reversed, and the higher class of evidence is put first.<p>Unto you also (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The also is variously explained. According to some, referring to a special circle of Christian readers beyond those addressed at the conclusion of the Gospel. Others, again, as referring to those who had not seen and heard as contrasted with eye-witnesses. Thus Augustine on <a href="/john/20-26.htm">John 20:26</a> sqq. "He (Thomas) touched the man, and confessed the God. And the Lord, consoling us who, now that He is seated in heaven, cannot handle Him with the hand, but touch Him by faith, says, 'Because thou hast seen thou hast believed; blessed are they who have not seen and believe.' It is we that are described; we that are pointed out. May there therefore come to pass in us that blessedness which the Lord predicted should be: the Life itself has been manifested in the flesh, so that the thing which can be seen with the heart alone might be seen with the eyes also, that it might heal our hearts."<p>Fellowship (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>This word introduces us to one of the main thoughts of the Epistle. The true life in man, which comes through the acceptance of Jesus as the Son of God, consists in fellowship with God and with man. On the word, see on <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>; see on <a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>. The verb &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; to come into fellowship, to be made a partner, to be partaker of, occurs <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-11.htm">2 John 1:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>, etc. The expression here, (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;) is stronger, since it expresses the enjoyment or realization of fellowship, as compared with the mere fact of fellowship. See on <a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>.<p>Our fellowship (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;)<p>More strictly, the fellowship, that which is ours, according to John's characteristic practice of defining and emphasizing a noun by an article and possessive pronoun.

The fellowship with both contemplates both as united in the Godhead. Plato says of one who lives in unrestrained desire and robbery, "Such an one is the friend neither of God nor man, for he is incapable of communion (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and he who is incapable of communion (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) us also incapable of friendship" ("Gorgias," 507). So in the "Symposium" (188), and he defines divination as "the art of communion (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) between gods and men." </body></html>
