The apostles had seen Him while they witnessed his wisdom and holiness, his miracles, and love and mercy, during some years, till they saw him crucified for sinners, and afterwards risen from the dead. They touched him, so as to have full proof of his resurrection. This Divine Person, the Word of life, the Word of God, appeared in human nature, that he might be the Author and Giver of eternal life to mankind, through the redemption of his blood, and the influence of his new-creating Spirit. The apostles declared what they had seen and heard, that believers might share their comforts and everlasting advantages. They had free access to God the Father. They had a happy experience of the truth in their souls, and showed its excellence in their lives. This communion of believers with the Father and the Son, is begun and kept up by the influences of the Holy Spirit. The benefits Christ bestows, are not like the scanty possessions of the world, causing jealousies in others; but the joy and happiness of communion with God is all-sufficient, so that any number may partake of it; and all who are warranted to say, that truly their fellowship is with the Father, will desire to lead others to partake of the same blessedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And these things write we unto you - These things respecting him who was manifested in the flesh, and respecting the results which flow from that.<p>That your joy may be full - This is almost the same language which the Saviour used when addressing his disciples as he was about to leave them, <a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>; and there can be little doubt that John had that declaration in remembrance when he uttered this remark. See the notes at that passage. The sense here is, that full and clear views of the Lord Jesus, and the fellowship with him and with each other, which would follow from that, would be a source of happiness. Their joy would be complete if they had that; for their real happiness was to be found in their Saviour. The best editions of the Greek Testament now read "your joy," instead of the common reading "our joy." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. these things&#8212;and none other, namely, this whole Epistle.<p>write we unto you&#8212;Some oldest manuscripts omit "unto you," and emphasize "we." Thus the antithesis is between "we" (apostles and eye-witnesses) and "your." We write thus that your joy may be full. Other oldest manuscripts and versions read "OUR joy," namely, that our joy may be filled full by bringing you also into fellowship with the Father and Son. (Compare Joh 4:36, end; Php 2:2, "Fulfil ye my joy," Php 2:16; 4:1; 2Jo 8). It is possible that "your" may be a correction of transcribers to make this verse harmonize with Joh 15:11; 16:24; however, as John often repeats favorite phrases, he may do so here, so "your" may be from himself. So 2Jo 12, "your" in oldest manuscripts. The authority of manuscripts and versions on both sides here is almost evenly balanced. Christ Himself is the source, object, and center of His people's joy (compare 1Jo 1:3, end); it is in fellowship with Him that we have joy, the fruit of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not insipid, spiritless, empty, as carnal joy is, apt through the deficiency of its cause to admit of intermingled qualms; but lively and vigorous, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.">2Jo 1:12</a></span>, well grounded, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a></span>, such as is of the right kind, and will grow up into the perfect plenitude and fulness of joy, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/16-11.htm" title="You will show me the path of life: in your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand there are pleasures for ever more.">Psalm 16:11</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And these things write we unto you,....

The Syriac version renders it, "that our joy, which is in you, may be full"; it is the joy of the ministers of the word, when the saints are established in the faith of Christ's person and offices, and have communion with him, with which view they declare him, and bear record of him.

After stating the subject and aim of his apostolic proclamation, the apostle intimates specially the aim of this Epistle. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ταῦτα γράφομεν ὑμῖν</span>] By <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, <span class="greekheb">γράφομεν</span> is made co-ordinate with <span class="greekheb">ἀπαγγέλλομεν</span>, the particular with the general, not the composition of the Epistle with that of the Gospel (Ebrard). <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> refers neither merely to what precedes (Russmeyer, Sander), nor merely to what immediately follows (Socin), but to the whole Epistle (Lücke, de Wette, Düsterdieck). With <span class="greekheb">γράφομεν ὑμῖν</span>, comp. <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1 John 2:12</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>. The plural is used because John as an apostle writes in the consciousness that <span class="ital">his</span> written word is in full agreement with the preaching of all the apostles; all the apostles, as it were, speak through him to the readers of the Epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἡ χαρὰ ὑμῶν ᾖ πεπληρωμένη</span>] comp. with this <a href="/john/15-11.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.">John 15:11</a>; <a href="/john/17-13.htm" title="And now come I to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.">John 17:13</a>. The aim of the Epistle is the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωσις</span> of joy which it, as apostolic testimony to the salvation founded on the <span class="greekheb">φανέρωσις</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ αἰώνιος</span> (<a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>), was to produce in its readers. De Wette groundlessly thinks that the effect, namely, the perfected Christian frame of mind, is here put for the cause, namely, Christian perfection. It is rather very especially the perfect <span class="greekheb">χαρά</span> (not merely “the joy of conflict and victory,” Ebrard) that is the goal to which the apostle would lead his readers by this Epistle. With the reading <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> it is the <span class="greekheb">χαρά</span> of the apostles—first of all of John—that is the goal, and no doubt the joy which for them consists in this, that their word produces fruit in their hearers.[46] Incorrectly Ebrard: “If <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> is right, then the apostle resumes the mutual <span class="greekheb">ἡμετέρα</span>: that our (common) joy may be full;” for, on the one hand, <span class="greekheb">ἡμετέρα</span> is not mutual (embracing the apostles and the readers), and, on the other, <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> would have to be referred to the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> that is contained in <span class="greekheb">γράφομεν</span>, but not to the more remote <span class="greekheb">ἡμετέρα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[46] Theophyl.: <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν γὰρ ὑμῖν κοινωνούντων πλείστην ἔχομεν τὰν χαρὰν ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἦν τῆς θερισταῖς ὁ χαίρων σπορεὺς ἐν τῇ τοῦ μισθοῦ ἀπολήψει βραβεύσει</span>, <span class="greekheb">χαιρέντων καὶ τούτων ὅτι τῶν πόνων αὐτῶν ἀπολαύουσι</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1 John 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>, clearly the editorial plural. The reading <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> seems at the first glance more attractive than <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> as evincing a generous solicitude on the part of the Apostle for the highest good of his readers, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the fulfilment of their joy. Rothe: “Wer es weis, dass das uranfängliche Leben erschienen ist und er mit demselben und dadurch mit dem Vater Gemeinschaft haben kann, dessen Herz muss hoch schlagen”. In truth, however, <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> evinces a still more generous solicitude—the very spirit of Jesus. As He could not be happy in Heaven without us, so the Apostle’s joy was incomplete unless his readers shared it. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Samuel Rutherford:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Oh! if one soul from Anwoth<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Meet me at God’s right hand,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>My heaven will be two heavens<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In Immanuel’s land.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">these things write we</span>] These words apply to the whole Epistle, of which he here states the purpose, just as in <a href="/john/20-31.htm" title="But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.">John 20:31</a> he states the purpose of the Gospel. Both ‘write’ and ‘we’ are emphatic: it is a permanent message that is sent, and it is sent by apostolic authority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that your joy may be full</span>] According to the better reading and rendering, <span class="ital">that</span> <span class="bld">our</span> <span class="ital">joy may be</span> <span class="bld">fulfilled</span>. Tyndale in his first edition (1525) has ‘your’, in his second (1534) and third (1535) ‘our’. In the Greek we have a passive participle, not an adjective: that our joy may be made full and may remain so. Moreover the expression that joy is made full or fulfilled is one of S. John’s characteristic phrases, and this should be brought out in translation. The active ‘fulfil my joy’ occurs <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm" title="Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.">Php 2:2</a>; but the passive only here, <a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>; <a href="/john/15-11.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.">John 15:11</a>; <a href="/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>; <a href="/john/17-13.htm" title="And now come I to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.">John 17:13</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-12.htm" title="Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.">2 John 1:12</a>. Comp. ‘These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be fulfilled’, and ‘These things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves’ (<a href="/john/15-11.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.">John 15:11</a>; <a href="/john/17-13.htm" title="And now come I to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.">John 17:13</a>). Once more Christ’s prayer and S. John’s purpose are one and the same. See on <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a></span>. ‘<span class="ital">Our</span> joy’ may mean either the <span class="ital">Apostolic</span> joy at the good results of Apostolic teaching; or the joy in which the <span class="ital">recipients</span> of the teaching share—‘yours as well as ours’. In either case the joy is that serene happiness, which is the result of conscious union with God and good men, of conscious possession of eternal life (see on <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>), and which raises us above pain and sorrow and remorse. The first person plural used throughout this Introduction is the plural of authority, indicating primarily S. John, but S. John as the representative of the Apostles. In the body of the Epistle he uses the first person <span class="ital">singular</span> (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning....">1 John 2:7-8</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake....">1 John 2:12-14</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-21.htm" title="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1 John 2:21</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-26.htm" title="These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.">1 John 2:26</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>). The concluding words of the Introduction to the Epistle of Barnabas are striking both in their resemblance and difference: “Now I, not as a teacher, but as one of you, will set forth a few things, by means of which in your present case ye may be gladdened.” Bede remarks, doubtless as the result of personal experience, that the joy of teachers is made full when by their preaching many are brought to the communion of the Church and of Him through whom the Church is strengthened and increased.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following profound thoughts struggle for expression in these four opening verses. There is a Being who has existed with God the Father from all eternity: He is the Father’s Son: He is also the expression of the Father’s Nature and Will. He has been manifested in space and time; and of that manifestation I and others have had personal knowledge: by the united evidence of our senses we have been convinced of its reality. In revealing to us the Divine Nature He becomes to us life, eternal life. With the declaration of all this in our hands as the Gospel, we come to you in this Epistle, that you may unite with us in our great possession, and that our joy in the Lord may be made complete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We now enter upon the first main division of the Epistle; which extends to <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a>, the chief subject of which (with much digression) is the theme God is Light, and that in two parts: i. the Positive Side—What Walking in the Light involves; the Condition and Conduct of the Believer (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a> to <a href="/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a>): ii. the Negative Side—What Walking in the Light excludes; the Things and Persons to be avoided (<a href="/context/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake....">1 John 2:12-28</a>).

There is the joy of faith, the joy of love, the joy of hope.

The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> seems preferable to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> are not coordinate: <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is the apostolic "we;" <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> means "your joy as well as mine." This verse takes the place of the usual "grace and peace" in the opening of other Epistles; and as verse 3 recalls <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>, so this recalls <a href="/john/17-13.htm">John 17:13</a>. The joy is that of knowing that, though in the world, they are not of it, but are one with one another, and with the Father and with the Son. The gospel is always joy: "Rejoice alway" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>); "Rejoice in the Lord alway" (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). To know that the Eternal Life has been manifested, that we have communion with him, and through him with the Father, must be joy. Whereas Gnosticism, by denying the atonement, and "the personal office of God in the salvation of the world," cuts off one great sphere of God's love, and consequently one great cause of the believer's joy. To sum up this introduction: St. John gives his Gospel to the Church <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in order that all may share in the union for which Christ prayed; and to the Gospel he adds this Epistle <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, that all may realize the joy resulting from this union - <span class="cmt_word">that our joy may be fulfilled.</span> In this introduction we find the following expressions which are characteristic of St. John, serving to show the common authorship of the Gospel and Epistle, and in some cases of the Revelation also: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. It is among the many excellences of the Revised Version that characteristic expressions are marked by a uniform translation; whereas in the Authorized Version they are obscured by capriciously varying the translation: <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is rendered in <span class="accented">four</span> different ways  - "bear witness," "bear record," "give record," "testify" (cf. page 10). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>These things<p>The whole Epistle.<p>Write we unto you (&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The best texts read &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; we, instead of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to you. Both the verb and the pronoun are emphatic. The writer speaks with conscious authority, and his message is to be not only announced (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>), but written.

Frequent in John.

"The peace of reconciliation, the blessed consciousness of sonship, the happy growth in holiness, the bright prospect of future completion and glory, - all these are but simple details of that which, in all its length and breadth is embraced by one word, Eternal Life, the real possession of which is the immediate source of our joy. We have joy, Christ's joy, because we are blessed, because we have life itself in Christ" (Dsterdieck, cit. by Alford). And Augustine: "For there is a joy which is not given to the ungodly, but to those who love Thee for thine own sake, whose joy Thou thyself art. And this is the happy life, to rejoice to Thee, of Thee; this is it and there is no other" ("Confessions," x., 22). Alford is right in remarking that this verse gives an epistolary character to what follows, but it can hardly be said with him that it "fills the place of the &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; greeting, lit., rejoice, so common in the opening of Epistles." </body></html>
