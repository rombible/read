The great God should be represented to this dark world, as pure and perfect light. As this is the nature of God, his doctrines and precepts must be such. And as his perfect happiness cannot be separated from his perfect holiness, so our happiness will be in proportion to our being made holy. To walk in darkness, is to live and act against religion. God holds no heavenly fellowship or intercourse with unholy souls. There is no truth in their profession; their practice shows its folly and falsehood. The eternal Life, the eternal Son, put on flesh and blood, and died to wash us from our sins in his own blood, and procures for us the sacred influences by which sin is to be subdued more and more, till it is quite done away. While the necessity of a holy walk is insisted upon, as the effect and evidence of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, the opposite error of self-righteous pride is guarded against with equal care. All who walk near to God, in holiness and righteousness, are sensible that their best days and duties are mixed with sin. God has given testimony to the sinfulness of the world, by providing a sufficient, effectual Sacrifice for sin, needed in all ages; and the sinfulness of believers themselves is shown, by requiring them continually to confess their sins, and to apply by faith to the blood of that Sacrifice. Let us plead guilty before God, be humble, and willing to know the worst of our case. Let us honestly confess all our sins in their full extent, relying wholly on his mercy and truth through the righteousness of Christ, for a free and full forgiveness, and our deliverance from the power and practice of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If we say that we have not sinned - In times that are past. Some perhaps might be disposed to say this; and as the apostle is careful to guard every point, he here states that if a man should take the ground that his past life had been wholly upright, it would prove that he had no true religion. The statement here respecting the past seems to prove that when, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>, he refers to the present - "if we say we have no sin" - he meant to say that if a man should claim to be perfect, or to be wholly sanctified, it would demonstrate that he deceived himself; and the two statements go to prove that neither in reference to the past nor the present can anyone lay claim to perfection.<p>We make him a liar - Because he has everywhere affirmed the depravity of all the race. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>; 2; 3. On no point have his declarations been more positive and uniform than on the fact of the universal sinfulness of man. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11-12</a>; <a href="/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>; <a href="/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9-20</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21</a>.<p>And his word is not in us - His truth; that is, we have no true religion. The whole system of Christianity is based on the fact that man is a fallen being, and needs a Saviour; and unless a man admits that, of course he cannot be a Christian.<p>Remarks On <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1.htm">1 John 1</a><p>(1) The importance of the doctrine of the incarnation of the Son of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-2</a>. On that doctrine the apostle lays great stress; begins his Epistle with it; presents it in a great variety of forms; dwells upon it as if he would not have it forgotten or misunderstood. It has all the importance which he attached to it, for.<p>(a) it is the most wonderful of all the events of which we have any knowledge;<p>(b) it is the most deeply connected with our welfare.<p>(2) the intense interest which true piety always takes in this doctrine, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-2</a>. The feelings of John on the subject are substantially the feelings of all true Christians. The world passes it by in unbelief, or as if it were of no importance; but no true Christian can look at the fact that the Son of God became incarnate but with the deepest emotion.<p>(3) it is an object of ardent desire with true Christians that all others should share their joys, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3-4</a>. There is nothing selfish, or narrow, or exclusive in true religion; but every sincere Christian who is happy desires that all others should be happy too.<p>(4) wherever there is true fellowship with God, there is with all true Christians, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3-4</a>. There is but one church, one family of God; and as all true Christians have fellowship with God, they must have with each other.<p>(5) wherever there is true fellowship with Christians, there is with God himself, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3-4</a>. If we love his people, share their joys, labor with them in promoting his cause, and love the things which they love, we shall show that we love him. There is but one God, and one church; and if all the members love each other, they will love their common God and Saviour. An evidence, therefore, that we love Christians, becomes an evidence that we love God.<p>(6) it is a great privilege to be a Christian, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3-4</a>.

Parallel to 1Jo 1:8.<p>we have not sinned&#8212;referring to the commission of actual sins, even after regeneration and conversion; whereas in 1Jo 1:8, "we have no sin," refers to the present GUILT remaining (until cleansed) from the actual sins committed, and to the SIN of our corrupt old nature still adhering to us.

The apostle has regard either to the Gnostics, a set of heretics of this age, who fancied themselves pure, spiritual, and perfect, even in the midst of all their impurities, and notwithstanding their vicious lives; or to judaizing Christians, and it may be to the Jews themselves, who entertained such sort of notions as these of being perfect and without sin (h). <p>(h) Vid.

The perfect does not prove that <span class="greekheb">ἡμαρτήκαμεν</span> is meant of sins before conversion (Socinus, Russmeyer, Paulus, etc.); the subject here, as in all the verses before, is the sinning of Christians; for to deny <span class="ital">former</span> sin could not occur to a Christian.[74] The perfect is explained both by John’s usus loquendi, according to which an action lasting up to the present is often represented in this tense, and also by the fact that the confession every time refers to sins previously committed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΕΎΣΤΗΝ ΠΟΙΟῦΜΕΝ ΑὐΤΌΝ</span></span></span>] corresponds to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΑΥΤΟῪς ΠΛΑΝῶΜΕΝ</span></span></span>; it brings out that the Christian by the denial of his sin accuses God (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΌΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸν Θεόν</span>) of lying.

T., is forbidden by the train of thought, for the subject here is not the sinfulness <span class="ital">of man in general</span>, but the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνειν</span> <span class="ital">of Christians.</span>[75] Ebrard interprets <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΛΌΓΟς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span></span></span>. as the “self-proclamation of the nature of God, which has taken place both in the verbal revelations of the O. and N.

The words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἜΣΤΙΝ ἘΝ ἩΜῖΝ</span></span></span> are erroneously explained by Baumgarten-Crusius: “we have given it up, or also: we are not qualified or fit for it;” it means rather: “it is not vividly imprinted in our hearts” (Spener); it has remained external to us, inwardly unknown.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] Therefore it is also not correct to refer <span class="greekheb">ἡμαρτήκ</span>. to present and past, as Hornejus explains: si dixerimus nos non tantum peccatum nunc non habere, sed nec peccatores unquam fuisse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] This has been more or less overlooked by the commentators (even by Düsterdieck and Ebrard), although it is also important for the understanding of chap. <a href="/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:...">1 John 2:1-2</a>. But John may with justice assume that the word of God denies the absolute sinlessness of Christians, since—apart from the fact that even the O. T. does not depict the <span class="greekheb">δίκαιοι</span> as perfectly holy—in every evangelical announcement the <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> is an essential element for believers, which presupposes their having and doing sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">that we have not sinned</span>] This is not the same as ‘that we have no sin’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a></span>), and therefore we have once more not repetition, but expansion and strengthening of what precedes. ‘Have no sin’ refers to a sinful state; ‘have not sinned’ refers to the actual commission of particular acts of sin: the one is the inward principle, the other is its result. But the whole context shews that neither expression refers to sins committed before baptism: no Christian would have denied these: moreover S. John does not write to the recently converted, but to those who have had time to grow lukewarm and indifferent. Both expressions refer to sin after baptism, and the perfect (<span class="greekheb">ἡμαρτήκαμεν</span>) has the common meaning of the Greek perfect, present result of past action; ‘we are in the condition of not having sinned’. This use of the perfect is specially frequent in S. John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we make Him a liar</span>] Worse than ‘we lead ourselves astray’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a></span>), as that is worse than ‘we lie’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a></span>). This use of the verb ‘make’ in the sense of ‘assert that one is’ is frequent in the Gospel: ‘He <span class="ital">made</span> Himself the Son of God’; ‘Every one that <span class="ital">maketh</span> himself a king’ (<a href="/john/19-7.htm" title="The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.">John 19:7</a>; <a href="/john/19-12.htm" title="And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.">John 19:12</a>; comp. <a href="/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>, <a href="/john/8-53.htm" title="Are you greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom make you yourself?">John 8:53</a>, <a href="/john/10-33.htm" title="The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.">John 10:33</a>). God’s promise to forgive sin to the penitent would be a lie if there were no sin to be repented of. And more than this; God’s whole scheme of salvation assumes that all men are sinful and need to be redeemed: therefore those who deny their sinfulness charge God with deliberately framing a vast libel on human nature. Whereas S. Paul says, ‘Let God be found true, but every man a liar’ (<a href="/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">His word is not in us</span>] God’s revelation of Himself has no home in our hearts: it remains outside us, as the light remains outside and separated from him who shuts himself up in darkness. The expressions, ‘to be in’ and ‘to abide in’, to express intimate relationship, are characteristic of S. John: and either of the things related can be said to be in the other. Thus, either ‘His word is not in us’ (comp. <a href="/1_john/2-14.htm" title="I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God stays in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.">1 John 2:14</a>), or ‘If ye abide in My word’ (<a href="/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a>): either ‘The truth is not in us’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a></span>), or ‘He standeth not in the truth’ (<a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>). Sometimes the two modes of expression are combined; ‘Abide in Me, and I in you’ (<a href="/john/15-4.htm" title="Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.">John 15:4</a>). ‘His word’ means especially the Gospel: as it is the sins of <span class="ital">Christians</span> which are being considered, the O.T., though not excluded, cannot be specially meant. ‘Word’ is more personal than ‘the truth’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a></span>), which does not necessarily imply a speaker.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/1-10.htm" title="If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.">1 John 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ψεύστην ποιοῦμεν αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="ital">we make Him a liar</span>) God says, Thou hast sinned; to deny this is impious. Comp. ch. <a href="/1_john/5-10.htm" title="He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.">1 John 5:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">His word</span>) which is true: <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a>. The word accuses us with truth; and by contradiction it is driven from the heart.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">in us</span>) and therefore we are <span class="ital">liars</span>: ch. <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Once more we have no mere repetition, but a fresh thought. "We have not sin" (verse 8) refers to our natural condition; "we have not sinned" (verse 10) refers to definite acts. Note the climax: we lie (verse 6); we lead ourselves utterly astray (verse 8): we make God a liar (verse 10). The whole of God's dealing with man since the Fall, especially in the Incarnation, is based on the fact of man's innate sinfulness. To deny this fact, therefore, is to charge the God of light and truth with acting and maintaining a vast and persistent lie. It is difficult to see how this strong language can be reconciled with the Roman dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary: why does not her "son" (<a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26, 27</a>) except her from its sweep? His word is not in us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, we are cut off from all communication with him (<a href="/john/5-38.htm">John 5:38</a>; <a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>). "His Word" is the sum total of the Divine revelation. That which in itself is "the truth "(verse 8), when communicated to us is "his Word." How thoroughly the Church of England enters into the spirit of these verses (8-10) is shown by the fact that it appoints confession and absolution as part of public service <span class="accented">every morning and evening throughout the year</span>, as well as of every celebration of the Eucharist. As Bede points out, the Lord's Prayer itself, with the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses," is a conclusive answer to Pelagian opponents of St. John's doctrine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We have not sinned (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Committed sins.
