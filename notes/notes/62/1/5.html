The attention is aroused, as by the silence before the thunderstorm, to expect a central and fundamental notion of the utmost importance.<p><span class= "bld">That God is light.</span>—Here is the essence of Christian theology, the truth about the Deity as opposed to all the imperfect conceptions of Him which had embittered the minds of the wise. To the heathen, Deity had meant angry, malevolent beings, worshipped best by the secrecy of outrageous vice; to the Greeks and Romans, forces of nature transformed into superhuman men and women, powerful and impure; to the philosophers, an abstraction either moral or physical; to the Gnostics it was a remote idea, equal and contending forces of good and evil, recognisable only through less and less perfect deputies. All this John, summing up what the Old Testament and our Lord had said about the Almighty Father, sweeps away in one simple declaration of truth. Light was God’s garment in <a href="/psalms/104-2.htm" title="Who cover yourself with light as with a garment: who stretch out the heavens like a curtain:">Psalm 104:2</a>; to Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-2.htm" title="In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,">Ezekiel 1:2</a>), the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord was brightness; to Habakkuk (<a href="/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1John 3:3</a>), His brightness was as the light; Christ had called the sons of God children of the light (<a href="/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>), and announced Himself as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>); in the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>), Christ was the refracted ray of the Father’s glory, “the express image of His person;” to James, the Almighty was the Father of all lights (<a href="/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>); to Paul, He dwells “in the light that no man can approach unto” (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1Timothy 6:16</a>); to St. Peter, the Christian state is an admission “into His marvellous light” (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>). These ideas John comprehends: God is Light. Light physical, because (1) it was He who called everything first out of darkness, and (2) from whom proceeds all health and perfection; light intellectual, because (1) He is the source of all wisdom and knowledge, and (2) in His mind exist the ideals after which all things strive; light moral, because (1) His perfection shows that the difference between good and evil is not merely a question of degree, but fundamental and final, and (2) the life of Christ had exhibited that contrast sharply: once for all. Thus, on this declaration depends the whole doctrine of sin: sin is not merely imperfection; it is enmity to God. There can be no shades of progression, uniting good and evil: in Him is no darkness at all. Good and evil may be mixed in an individual: in themselves they are contrary.<p>(2) (6) <span class= "bld">If we say</span>.—A favourite form with John, expressing sympathetic delicacy.<p><span class= "bld">That we have fellowship with him. . . .</span>—Some of the Gnostics (like the Anabaptists) said that on account of their spiritual knowledge they were free to act as they liked, without committing sin. For walking as a description of the spiritual state, compare <a href="/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1John 2:6</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-6.htm" title="And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.">2John 1:6</a>; <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Darkness</span> would include any conscious habit which was opposed to God’s example of perfection.<p><span class= "bld">We lie</span>.—We are a self-contradiction, and we know it.<p><span class= "bld">And do not the truth</span>.—The truth with St. John is as much a matter of action as of thought and word; that sphere of conduct which is in harmony with God, whose nature is Light.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">As he is in the light</span>.—The effulgence of the atmosphere of the perfectly good, the sinlessly loving, the gloriously pure, which, created by God and proceeding from Him, is specially “His throne.” At the same time, wherever such characteristics of Divine Light are found, there He is particularly present.<p><span class= "bld">We have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</span>—The antithesis to “lying and doing not the truth,” presented under the twofold aspect of (1) the brotherly result of walking with God, (2) its purifying influence. Each human being that comes near us becomes the object of our friendly sympathy; and the sacrifice of Christ has both put away the sin of the world and prevents sin from reigning in our mortal bodies; it obtains forgiveness for us, and by reminding us that it was sin that brought Jesus to the cross, has a continually purifying power over us, through the Spirit of Christ and of the Father. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19-23</a>.)<p>(3) (8) <span class= "bld">If we say that we have no sin.</span>—The preceding words had reminded St. John that even mature Christians, though certainly not “walking in darkness,” yet have sinful tendencies in themselves: sensuous impulses, non-spiritual inclinations, lack of self-knowledge, a lowered standard, principles and views borrowed partly from the world, wavering of will, and hence even graver faults. Not to admit this would be to mislead ourselves, and in us the power and energy of light, searching the very corners of the heart, would not be working. (See <a href="/context/romans/7-18.htm" title="For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.">Romans 7:18-23</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>.)<p>(9) <span class= "bld">If we confess our sins.</span>—An advance in the thought from the general “having sin.” Confession to God must recognise and measure each particular fault. (<a href="/psalms/32-5.htm" title="I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-3.htm" title="For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.">Psalm 51:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm" title="He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.">Proverbs 28:13</a>; <a href="/luke/15-21.htm" title="And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight, and am no more worthy to be called your son.">Luke 15:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</span>—He, from the context, cannot possibly be any other than God. Here another grand progression of thought meets us: not merely “we are in the truth,” but the actual and glorious result on God’s side; faithful and just on account of Christ’s sacrifice and our repentance. For the double notion of forgiving and cleansing, see Note on <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>. The Romish interpreters, in their arbitrary way, limit the cleansing here to purgatory.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">If we say that we have not sinned.</span>—The argument of the passage equally excludes the interpretation “freedom from guilt since conversion” as “innocence during the whole life.” St. John is here repeating, in a more emphatic form, the thought of <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1John 1:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">We make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</span>—Stronger far than “we lie,” or “the truth is not in us.” Our foolish presumption is regarded in its worst aspect: an impiety against God, whose word, revelation, appeal to our conscience, and witness by the Spirit, are thus blasphemously contradicted. Parallel to “we do not the truth” and “the truth is not in us,” the practical result here is that we cannot be regarded as having in any sense received God’s revelation into our hearts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all....">1 John 1:5-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">This then is the message </span>— That is, one part of it; <span class="ital">which we have heard of him </span>— The Son of God; <span class="ital">that God is light </span>— The light of truth, wisdom, holiness, glory.

As if the apostle had said, We who have seen, and you who have not seen, do alike enjoy that fellowship with God and Christ, the imitation of God being the only sure proof of our having fellowship with him. <span class="ital">And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son </span>— With the grace purchased thereby; <span class="ital">cleanseth us from all sin </span>— Taketh away all the guilt, and therewith all the power of sin, both original and actual. There is also a cleansing from all sin in a higher sense, even from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, (see <a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;...">Ephesians 5:25-26</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>,) from whatever is contrary to the mind of Christ and the image of God, which may be experienced in the present life, by the blood of Christ, who, having died to procure for us the influences of the Spirit for fully sanctifying our nature, may be truly said to cleanse us from all sin by his blood. Of this cleansing, however, the apostle does not speak directly in this verse, but he speaks of it <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-10 A message from the Lord Jesus, the Word of life, the eternal Word, we should all gladly receive. The great God should be represented to this dark world, as pure and perfect light. As this is the nature of God, his doctrines and precepts must be such. And as his perfect happiness cannot be separated from his perfect holiness, so our happiness will be in proportion to our being made holy. To walk in darkness, is to live and act against religion. God holds no heavenly fellowship or intercourse with unholy souls. There is no truth in their profession; their practice shows its folly and falsehood. The eternal Life, the eternal Son, put on flesh and blood, and died to wash us from our sins in his own blood, and procures for us the sacred influences by which sin is to be subdued more and more, till it is quite done away. While the necessity of a holy walk is insisted upon, as the effect and evidence of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, the opposite error of self-righteous pride is guarded against with equal care. All who walk near to God, in holiness and righteousness, are sensible that their best days and duties are mixed with sin. God has given testimony to the sinfulness of the world, by providing a sufficient, effectual Sacrifice for sin, needed in all ages; and the sinfulness of believers themselves is shown, by requiring them continually to confess their sins, and to apply by faith to the blood of that Sacrifice. Let us plead guilty before God, be humble, and willing to know the worst of our case. Let us honestly confess all our sins in their full extent, relying wholly on his mercy and truth through the righteousness of Christ, for a free and full forgiveness, and our deliverance from the power and practice of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This then is the message which we have heard of him - This is the substance of the announcement (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  epangelia) which we have received of him, or which he made to us. The message here refers to what he communicated as the sum of the revelation which he made to man. The phrase "of him" (&#x3b1;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  ap' autou) does not mean respecting him, or about him, but from him; that is, this is what we received from his preaching; from all that he said. The peculiarity, the substance of all that he said, may be summed up in the declaration that God is light, and in the consequences which follow from this doctrine. He came as the messenger of Him who is light; he came to inculcate and defend the truths which flow from that central doctrine, in regard to sin, to the danger and duty of man, to the way of recovery, and to the rules by which men ought to live.<p>That God is light - Light, in the Scriptures, is the emblem of purity, truth, knowledge, prosperity, and happiness - as darkness is of the opposite. John here says that "God is light" - &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;  pho&#772;s - not the light, or a light, but light itself; that is, he is himself all light, and is the source and fountain of light in all worlds. He is perfectly pure, without any admixture of sin. He has all knowledge, with no admixture of ignorance on any subject. He is infinitely happy, with nothing to make him miserable. He is infinitely true, never stating or countenancing error; he is blessed in all his ways, never knowing the darkness of disappointment and adversity. Compare the <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> note; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a> note; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a> note.<p>And in him is no darkness at all - This language is much in the manner of John, not only affirming that a thing is so, but guarding it so that no mistake could possibly be made as to what he meant. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>. The expression here is designed to affirm that God is absolutely perfect; that there is nothing in him which is in any way imperfect, or which would dim or mar the pure splendor of his character, not even as much as the smallest spot would on the sun. The language is probably designed to guard the mind from an error to which it is prone, that of charging God with being the Author of the sin and misery which exist on the earth; and the apostle seems to design to teach that whatever was the source of sin and misery, it was not in any sense to be charged on God. This doctrine that God is a pure light, John lays down as the substance of all that he had to teach; of all that he had learned from him who was made flesh.

As all material life and growth depends on light, so all spiritual life and growth depends on God. As God here, so Christ, in 1Jo 2:8, is called "the true light."<p>no darkness at all&#8212;strong negation; Greek, "No, not even one speck of darkness"; no ignorance, error, untruthfulness, sin, or death. John heard this from Christ, not only in express words, but in His acted words, namely, His is whole manifestation in the flesh as "the brightness of the Father's glory." Christ Himself was the embodiment of "the message," representing fully in all His sayings, doings, and sufferings, Him who is LIGHT.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It being the professed scope and design of his writing, to draw men to a final participation and communion with God in his own blessedness, he reckons nothing more necessary to it, than to settle in their minds a right notion of God.

Of God by his Son the Word, or from Christ by his apostles. The Syriac version renders it, "this is the Gospel"; which is good news from a far country, a message sent from the King of kings to sinful men: or this is the annunciation, or declaration; that is, the thing declared, or showed. Some render it, "this is the promise", that whereas God is light, such who walk in the light shall have communion with him, and others shall not: <p>which we have heard of him; of Christ, who has declared him, that he is light without any mixture of darkness; that is a pure Spirit, and must be worshipped in a spiritual way; and that only spiritual worshippers are such as he seeks, and admits to communion with him. Moreover, they might hear and learn this of Christ, by his telling them that he himself was light, who is the image of the invisible God, insomuch, that he that has seen the Son, has seen the Father also. Wherefore, if the one is light, the other must be likewise; nor is there any coming to the Father, and enjoying communion with him, but through Christ; all which our Lord told his disciples. The Ethiopic version reads, "which ye have heard", very wrongly; for the words regard the apostles, who made a faithful declaration of the message they heard, and had from Christ, which is as follows: <p>and declare unto you that God is light; that is, God the Father, as distinguished from "him", Christ, of whom they had heard this message, and from Jesus Christ his Son, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>, what is declared of him, agreeably to the report of Christ, is, that he is "light"; that is, as light is opposed to the darkness of sin; he is pure and holy in his nature and works, and of such pure eyes as not to behold iniquity; and so perfectly holy, that angels cover their times before him, when they speak of his holiness: and as light is opposed to the darkness of ignorance, he is wise and knowing; he knows himself, his own nature, being, and perfections, his Son and Spirit, and their distinct modes of subsisting; he sees clearly all things in himself, all things he could do, or has determined shall be done; he has perfect knowledge of all creatures and things, and the darkness and the light are alike unto him, nor can the former hide from him: he is knowable, and to be discerned; he is clothed with light, and dwells in it; he may be known by the works of creation and providence; even the invisible things of him, his eternal power and Godhead, may be clearly seen and understood by them, and especially in his word, and most clearly in his Son; it is owing to the darkness of men, and not to any in and about God, who is light, that he is so little known as he is: and, like the light, he illuminates others; he is the Father of lights, the author and giver of all light; of the light of reason to men in general; and of grace here, and glory hereafter, to his own people, which are both signified by light; in whose light they see light; and he refreshes and delights their souls with the light of his countenance now, and with his glorious presence in the other world: <p>and in him is no darkness at all; no darkness of sin; nothing is more contrary to him, or more distant from him: nor any darkness of error and ignorance; what is unknown to men, as the times and seasons; what angels were ignorant of, and even Christ, as man, as the day and hour of Jerusalem's destruction, were known to the Father; in him is no ignorance of anything whatever; nor is there any variableness or shadow of turning in him, as there is in the luminous body of the sun; but God is always the same pure and holy, wise and knowing Being. It is usual with the Cabalistic Jews (e), to call the supreme Being  light the most simple light, hidden light, and infinite light, with respect to his nature, glory, and majesty, and with regard also to his grace and mercy, justice and judgment; though, as R. Sangart says (f), this is to be understood of him figuratively. <p>(e) Lex. Cabalist, p. 63, 64.

This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.">2 John 1:6</a>. In all these cases ‘is this’ means ‘This is what it consists in, This is the sum and substance of it’. The conjunction does not introduce an inference: here, as in the Gospel, the main portion of the writing is joined on to the Introduction by a simple ‘and’. Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Rhemish all have ‘and’: ‘then’ comes from Geneva, apparently under the influence of Beza’s <span class="ital">igitur</span>. The connexion of thought seems to be this. S. John is writing that we may have fellowship with God (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a></span>): and in order to have this we must know 1. what God is (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a></span>), and 2. what we consequently are bound to be (6–10). The word for ‘message’ (<span class="greekheb">ἀγγελία</span>) occurs only in this Epistle (<a href="/1_john/3-11.htm" title="For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.">1 John 3:11</a>) in N.T., but is more frequent in LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Once more we have a striking parallel between Gospel and Epistle: the Gospel opens with a sentence very similar in form; ‘And the witness of John is this’ (<a href="/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a>). All these similarities strengthen the belief that the two were written about the same time, and were intended to accompany one another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from Him</span>] From Christ. The pronoun used (<span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>) is not the one (<span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span>) commonly used for Christ in this Epistle. But here the context decides: ‘Him’ refers back to ‘His Son Jesus Christ’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a></span>), the subject of the opening verses (1–3). Moreover, it was from Christ, and not immediately from the Father, that the Apostles received their message.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and declare unto you</span>] Better, <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">announce</span> <span class="ital">unto you</span>: not precisely the same verb as was rendered ‘declare’ in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)...">1 John 1:2-3</a></span>. Both are compounds of the same verb; but while the former has merely the notion of proclaiming and making known, this has the notion of proclaiming <span class="ital">again</span> what has been received elsewhere. The one is <span class="ital">annuntiare</span>, the other <span class="ital">renuntiare</span>. S. John <span class="ital">hands on the message</span> received from Christ: it is no invention of his own. It is a message, and not a discovery. So also the Spirit makes known or reveals to us truths which proceed from the Father (<a href="/context/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come....">John 16:13-15</a>): comp. <a href="/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1 Peter 1:12</a>, where the same verb is used in all cases.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God is light</span>] This is the theme of the first main division of the Epistle, as ‘God is Love’ of the second: so that this verse stands in the same relation to the first great division as <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;...">1 John 1:1-4</a></span> to the whole Epistle. No one tells us so much about the Nature of God as S. John: other writers tell us what God <span class="ital">does</span>, and what attributes He <span class="ital">possesses</span>; S. John tells us what He <span class="ital">is</span>. There are three statements in the Bible which stand alone as revelations of the Nature of God, and they are all in the writings of S. John: ‘God is spirit’ (<a href="/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a>); ‘God is light’, and ‘God is love’ (<a href="/1_john/4-8.htm" title="He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.">1 John 4:8</a>). In all these momentous statements the predicate has no article, either definite or indefinite. We are not told that God is <span class="ital">the</span> Spirit, or <span class="ital">the</span> Light, or <span class="ital">the</span> Love: nor (in all probability) that He is <span class="ital">a</span> Spirit, or <span class="ital">a</span> light. But ‘God is spirit, is light, is love’: spirit, light, love are His very Nature. They are not mere attributes, like mercy and justice: they are Himself. They are probably the nearest approach to a definition of God that the human mind could frame or comprehend: and in the history of thought and religion they are unique. The more we consider them, the more they satisfy us. The simplest intellect can understand their meaning; the subtlest cannot exhaust it. No philosophy, no religion, not even the Jewish, had risen to the truth that God is light. ‘The Lord shall be <span class="ital">to thee</span> an everlasting light’ (<a href="/context/isaiah/60-19.htm" title="The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but the LORD shall be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory....">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>) is far short of it. But S. John knows it: and lest the great message which he conveys to us in his Gospel, ‘God is spirit’, should seem somewhat bare and empty in its indefiniteness, he adds this other message in his Epistle, ‘God is light, God is love’. No figure borrowed from the material world could give the idea of perfection so clearly and fully as <span class="ital">light</span>. It suggests ubiquity, brightness, happiness, intelligence, truth, purity, holiness. It suggests excellence without limit and without taint; an excellence whose nature it is to communicate itself and to pervade everything from which it is not of set purpose shut out. ‘Let there be light’ was the first fiat of the Creator; and on it all the rest depends. Light is the condition of beauty, and life, and growth, and activity: and this is as true in the intellectual, moral, and spiritual spheres as in the material universe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of the many beautiful and true ideas which the utterance ‘God is light’ suggests to us, two are specially prominent in this Epistle; <span class="ital">intelligence</span> and <span class="ital">holiness</span>. The Christian, anointed with the Holy Spirit, and in communion with God in Christ, possesses (1) knowledge, (2) righteousness. (1) ‘Ye know Him which is from the beginning’ (<a href="/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father....">1 John 2:13-14</a>); ‘I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it’ (<a href="/1_john/2-21.htm" title="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1 John 2:21</a>); ‘Ye need not that anyone teach you’ (<a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>); &c. &c. (2) ‘Every one that hath this hope on him purifieth himself, even as He is pure’ (<a href="/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1 John 3:3</a>); ‘Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God’; &c. &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and in Him is no darkness at all</span>] Or, retaining the telling order of the Greek, <span class="ital">and darkness in Him there is none at all</span>. This antithetic parallelism is characteristic of S. John’s style. He frequently emphasizes a statement by following it up with a denial of its opposite. Thus, in the next verse, ‘We lie, and do not the truth’. Comp. ‘We lead ourselves astray, and the truth is not in us’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a></span>); Abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him’ (<a href="/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>); ‘Is true, and is no lie’ (<a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>): comp. <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a>. So also in the Gospel: see on <a href="/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>. The denial here is very strong, the negative being doubled in the Greek; ‘none whatever, <span class="ital">none at all</span>’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another parallel between the Gospel and the Epistle must here be pointed out. In the Prologue to the former we have these ideas in succession; the Word, life, light, darkness. The same four follow in the same order here; ‘the <span class="ital">Word</span> of life’, ‘the <span class="ital">life</span> was manifested’, ‘God is <span class="ital">light</span>, and <span class="ital">darkness</span> in Him there is none’. Must we not suppose that the sequence of thought here has been influenced by the sequence in the corresponding portion of the Gospel?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The figurative use of ‘darkness’ for moral darkness, i.e. error and sin, is very frequent in S. John (<a href="/context/1_john/2-8.htm" title="Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines....">1 John 2:8-9</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a>; see on <a href="/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>; <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>). These passages shew that the meaning of this verse cannot be, ‘God has now been revealed, and no part of His Nature remains unknown’; which, moreover, could never be stated of Him who is incomprehensible. S. John is laying the foundation of Christian Ethics, of which the very first principle is that there is a God who intellectually, morally, and spiritually is <span class="ital">light</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“In speaking of ‘light’ and ‘darkness’ it is probable that S. John had before him the Zoroastrian speculations on the two opposing spiritual powers which influenced Christian thought at a very early date” (Westcott).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a> to <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a>.

What Walking in the Light involves<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This section is largely directed against the Gnostic doctrine that to the man of enlightenment all conduct is morally indifferent. Against every form of this doctrine, which sapped the very foundations of Christian Ethics, the Apostle never wearies of inveighing. So far from its being true that all conduct is alike to the enlightened man, it is the character of his conduct that will shew whether he is enlightened or not. If he is walking in the light his condition and conduct will exhibit these things; 1. <span class="ital">Fellowship with God and with the Brethren</span> (5–7); 2. <span class="ital">Consciousness and Confession of Sin</span> (8–10); 3. <span class="ital">Obedience to God by Imitation of Christ</span> (<a href="/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/1_john/2-25.htm">1 John 2:25</a>, and frequent in the New Testament) must be rejected here and in <a href="/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11</a> in favour of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), on overwhelming evidence. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament means "promise," which would be almost meaningless here. The change from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (verses 2, 3) to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is noteworthy: the one is "declare," the other "announce." The message received from Christ, the apostle announces or <span class="accented">reports</span> (<span class="accented">renunciat</span>) to his readers. He does not <span class="accented">name</span> Christ <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; he is so full of the thought of Christ that he omits to name him (cf. <a href="/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7, 9, 15</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is used of <span class="accented">authoritative</span> announcements; of priests and Levites in the LXX; of the Messiah (<a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>); of the Spirit (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13, 14, 15</a>); of the apostles (<a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 27</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). St. John speaks with authority. <span class="cmt_word">God is light;</span> not <span class="accented">the</span> Light, nor a light, but light; that is his <span class="accented">nature.</span> This sums up the Divine essence on its intellectual side, as "God is love" on its moral side. In neither case has the predicate the article: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Light and love are not attributes of God, but himself. The connexion between this message and the introduction is not at first obvious. But St. John writes with his Gospel before him, and the prologue to that supplies the link. There, as here, three ideas follow in order: <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. There, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> immediately suggests its opposite, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. It is on the revelation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, and the consequent struggle between <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that the Gospel is based. And this revelation is the highest: men alone are competent to receive or reject it. Other organisms exhibit the creative power as life: none but men can recognize it as light. And to know the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as light is to know the Father as  light; for the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the Revelation of the Father's nature. That God is, in his very nature, light, is an announcement peculiar to St. John. Others tell us that he is the Father of lights (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), the Possessor of light (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), dwelling in light (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); but not that he is light. To the heathen God is a God of darkness, an unknown Being; a Power to be blindly propitiated, not a Person to be known and loved. To the philosopher he is an abstraction, an idea, not directly cognizable by man. To the Jews he is a God who hideth himself; not light, but a consuming fire. To the Christian alone he is revealed as light, absolutely free from everything impure, material, obscure, and gloomy. Light was the first product of the Divine creative energy, the earnest and condition of order, beauty, life, growth, and joy. Of all phenomena it best represents the elements of all perfection. "This word 'light' is at once the simplest and the fullest and the deepest which can be used in human discourse. It is addressed to every man who has eyes and who has ever looked on the sun." It tells not only "of a Goodness and Truth without flaw; it tells of a Goodness and Truth that are always seeking to spread themselves, to send forth rays that shall penetrate everywhere, and scatter the darkness which opposes them" (Maurice). In like manner, darkness sums up the elements of evil - foulness, secrecy, repulsiveness, and gloom. In all but the lowest forms of existence it inevitably produces decay and death. Everything of the kind is excluded from the nature of God. And hence St. John, in his characteristic manner, immediately emphasizes the great announcement with an equivalent negative statement: <span class="cmt_word">Darkness in him there is not any at all</span> (comp. verse 8; <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 23, 27</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3, 6-8</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>). He does not say, "in his presence," but "in him." Darkness exists, physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual; there is abundance of obscurity, error, depravity, sin, and its consequence, death. But not a shade of these is "in him." The Divine Light is subject to no spots, no eclipse, no twilight, no night; as a Source of light it cannot in any degree fail. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>This then is (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., correctly and literally, and this.

Not a light, nor the light, with reference to created beings, as the light of men, the light of the world, but simply and absolutely God is light, in His very nature. Compare God is spirit, and see on <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a> : God is love, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>, <a href="/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>. The expression is not a metaphor. "All that we are accustomed to term light in the domain of the creature, whether with a physical or metaphysical meaning, is only an effluence of that one and only primitive Light which appears in the nature of God" (Ebrard). Light is immaterial, diffusive, pure, and glorious. It is the condition of life.<p>Physically, it represents glory; intellectually, truth; morally, holiness. As immaterial it corresponds to God as spirit; as diffusive, to God as love; as the condition of life, to God as life; as pure and illuminating, to God as holiness and truth. In the Old Testament, light is often the medium of God's visible revelations to men. It was the first manifestation of God in creation. The burning lamp passed between the pieces of the parted victim in God's covenant with Abraham. God went before Israel in a pillar of fire, descended in fire upon Sinai, and appeared in the luminons cloud which rested on the mercy-seat in the most holy place. In classical Greek &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; light, is used metaphorically for delight, deliverance, victory, and is applied to persons as a term of admiring affection, as we say that one is the light of our life, or the delight of our eyes. So Ulysses, on seeing his son Telemachus, says, "Thou hast come, Telemachus, sweet light (&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)" (Homer, "Odyssey," xvi., 23). And Electra, greeting her returning brother, Orestes, "O dearest light (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)" (Sophocles, "Electra," 1223). Occasionally, as by Euripides, of the light of truth ("Iphigenia at Tauris," 1046). No modern writer has developed the idea of God as light with such power and beauty as Dante. His "Paradise" might truthfully be called a study of light. Light is the only visible expression of God. Radiating from Him, it is diffused through the universe as the principle of life. This key-note is struck at the very opening of "the Paradise."<p>"The glory of Him who moveth everything<p>Doth penetrate the universe, and shine<p>In one part more and in another less.<p>continued...</body></html>
