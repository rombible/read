Thus, the issue of the divine government will be, that truth and virtue shall be finally victorious over error and wickedness, because God, the Patron of truth and virtue, possesseth far greater power and wisdom than the evil spirits who promote error and wickedness. <span class="ital">They </span>— Those false teachers; <span class="ital">are of the world </span>— Of the number of those that know not God; <span class="ital">therefore speak they of the world </span>— From the principle, wisdom, and spirit, that actuate worldly men; <span class="ital">and, </span>of consequence, <span class="ital">the world heareth them </span>— Namely, with approbation. “Lest the faithful should be discouraged by the success which false teachers oftentimes have in spreading their errors, the apostle observes that their success arises generally from their accommodating their doctrines to the prejudices and evil inclinations of the world. Wherefore, from the prevalence of any doctrine no argument can be drawn in favour of its truth.” <span class="ital">We </span>— Apostles; <span class="ital">are of God </span>— Immediately taught and sent by him, and have approved ourselves to be so by such irresistible evidence, that I may now venture to say, <span class="ital">he who knoweth God </span>— And experiences the governing influence of his fear and love, <span class="ital">heareth </span>and regardeth <span class="ital">us; </span>but <span class="ital">he who is not of God heareth not us </span>— Neither believes nor obeys our word; but, by rejecting our testimony, attended as it is with such evidence, he proves himself destitute of all true religion. <span class="ital">Hereby we know </span>— From what is said <a href="/context/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:...">1 John 4:2-6</a>; <span class="ital">the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error </span>— “This mark, by which St. John directed his disciples to judge of teachers, is not to be understood of their hearkening to the apostles personally, but of their receiving their doctrine with that submission which was due to persons inspired by the Spirit of God. Wherefore, though the apostles be all dead, yet as they still speak in their divinely-inspired writings, John, in this passage, declares that their writings are the test by which the disciples of Christ are to judge both of teachers and of their doctrine.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Christians who are well acquainted with the Scriptures, may, in humble dependence on Divine teaching, discern those who set forth doctrines according to the apostles, and those who contradict them. The sum of revealed religion is in the doctrine concerning Christ, his person and office. The false teachers spake of the world according to its maxims and tastes, so as not to offend carnal men. The world approved them, they made rapid progress, and had many followers such as themselves; the world will love its own, and its own will love it. The true doctrine as to the Saviour's person, as leading men from the world to God, is a mark of the spirit of truth in opposition to the spirit of error. The more pure and holy any doctrine is, the more likely to be of God; nor can we by any other rules try the spirits whether they are of God or not. And what wonder is it, that people of a worldly spirit should cleave to those who are like themselves, and suit their schemes and discourses to their corrupt taste?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye are of God - You are of his family; you have embraced his truth, and imbibed his Spirit.<p>Little children - Notes, <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>.<p>And have overcome them - Have triumphed over their arts and temptations; their endeavors to draw you into error and sin.

The apostle meant to say that it was by no power of their own that they achieved this victory, but it was to be traced solely to the fact that God dwelt among them, and had preserved them by his grace. What was true then is true now. He who dwells in the hearts of Christians by his Spirit, is infinitely more mighty than Satan, "the ruler of the darkness of this world;" and victory, therefore, over all his arts and temptations may be sure. In his conflicts with sin, temptation, and error, the Christian should never despair, for his God will insure him the victory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The cause of this victory, however, did not and does not lie in the human power of believers, but in the fact <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ ἐν ὑμῖν ἢ ὁ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span>;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> (according to Grotius, Erdmann, and others: <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>); as the believer is of God, God remains in him as the soul of his life; <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">ὁ διάβολος</span>, “whose children the antichrists are” (Lücke).
