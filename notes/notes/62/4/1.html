The mention of God’s Spirit at the conclusion of the last paragraph gave him a form in which to clothe the discussion of truth and falsehood in its human manifestations. By “spirits” he means those tendencies towards good and evil (here especially with regard to thought and opinion) which may be considered as coming from the supreme power of God, on the one hand, and from the inferior power of the devil, on the other. Into the question what these influences are, whether, like the Holy Spirit, they are personal or not, he does not enter. Where one quality, or opinion, shows itself in different individuals, he identifies it and calls it a spirit. Religious fervour might take a form quite antagonistic to the real will and law of God. For Christians there was but one standard by which to measure all claims on their religious allegiance: confession that the man Christ Jesus was the Word. All that demurred to that plain fact, and the loyalty implied by it, belonged to the spirit of antichrist. His hearers, however, if he understood them rightly, need not fear. By virtue of their adherence to the truth, God was in them. In Him they had conquered the spirits of the world, and had but to claim their victory. The false teachers might be known, and must be condemned by the savour of the world that was in their method and their message, and by their popularity with what was opposed to God. The Apostles and those who taught with them could confidently before God put forward the grand claim that theirs was the spirit that came from Him, because they had held undeviatingly to the truth as manifested in Jesus.<p>(6 <span class= "ital">a</span>.) (1) <span class= "bld">Beloved.</span>—Whenever St. John uses this word, he has a strong and earnest exhortation in hand.

It is clear that this verse presupposes an evangelistic presentation of Christ before refusal to confess His historical person could be made.

God is in them, and therefore the victory is already theirs. Although they may still have to struggle, they have only to claim Christ’s strength, and they have won. In making their choice between light and darkness, love and hate, good and evil, God and the devil, they became of the victorious party.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Them</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the antichrists, the false prophets, the spirits that are not of God.

There could be no spiritual pride in this; it was a conscientious obligation. God spoke in them, and their loyalty for bade alike disclaimer and accommodation. (Comp. <a href="/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king.

Because the Gnostics and other heretics, in the first age, to gain the greater credit to their erroneous doctrines, assumed to themselves the character and authority of inspired teachers, John put his disciples in mind, (<a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>,) that they had an unction from the Holy Spirit, by which they were enabled to judge with certainty, both of teachers and of their doctrine. He therefore, in this chapter, commands them not to believe rashly every teacher who pretended to be inspired, but to try the inspiration by which any preacher professed to speak, whether it was from God or from evil spirits; that after trial they might know whom it was their duty to attend to, and whom they ought to disregard and reject. And to secure them, as far as possible, from being deceived, he especially desires them to consider whether the teacher, who came to them, pretending to inspiration, held the great and fundamental doctrines of the gospel, which all the teachers, really inspired of God, regularly and uniformly maintained. His words may be paraphrased as follows: <span class="ital">Believe not every spirit </span>— By which any teacher is, or professes to be, actuated: or, believe not every teacher who pretends to be inspired by the Spirit of God; <span class="ital">but try the spirits — </span>Namely, <span class="ital">whether they are of God </span>— By the rule which God hath given. We are to try all spirits by the written word: <span class="ital">To the law and to the testimony! </span>If any man speak not according to these, the spirit which actuates him is not of God. <span class="ital">Because many false prophets </span>— Or false teachers; <span class="ital">are gone forth into the world </span>— With an intention to draw disciples after them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Christians who are well acquainted with the Scriptures, may, in humble dependence on Divine teaching, discern those who set forth doctrines according to the apostles, and those who contradict them. The sum of revealed religion is in the doctrine concerning Christ, his person and office. The false teachers spake of the world according to its maxims and tastes, so as not to offend carnal men. The world approved them, they made rapid progress, and had many followers such as themselves; the world will love its own, and its own will love it. The true doctrine as to the Saviour's person, as leading men from the world to God, is a mark of the spirit of truth in opposition to the spirit of error. The more pure and holy any doctrine is, the more likely to be of God; nor can we by any other rules try the spirits whether they are of God or not. And what wonder is it, that people of a worldly spirit should cleave to those who are like themselves, and suit their schemes and discourses to their corrupt taste?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beloved, believe not every spirit - Do not confide implicitly in everyone who professes to be under the influences of the Holy Spirit. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4-5</a>. The true and the false teachers of religion alike claimed to be under the influence of the Spirit of God, and it was of importance that all such pretensions should be examined. It was not to be admitted because anyone claimed to have been sent from God that therefore he was sent. Every such claim should be subjected to the proper proof before it was conceded. All pretensions to divine inspiration, or to being authorised teachers of religion, were to be examined by the proper tests, because there were many false and delusive teachers who set up such claims in the world.<p>But try the spirits whether they are of God - There were those in the early Christian church who had the gift of "discerning spirits," (see the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>), but it is not certain that the apostle refers here to any such supernatural power. It is more probable, as he addresses this command to Christians in general, that he refers to the ability of doing this by a comparison of the doctrines which they professed to hold with what was revealed, and by the fruits of their doctrines in their lives. If they taught what God had taught in his word, and if their lives corresponded with his requirements, and if their doctrines agreed with what had been inculcated by those who were admitted to be true apostles, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-6.htm">1 John 4:6</a>, they were to receive them as what they professed to be. If not, they were to reject them, and hold them to be impostors. It may be remarked, that it is just as proper and as important now to examine the claims of all who profess to be teachers of religion, as it was then. In a matter so momentous as religion, and where there is so much at stake, it is important that all pretensions of this kind should be subjected to a rigid examination. No one should be received as a religious teacher without the clearest evidence that he has come in accordance with the will of God, nor unless he inculcates the very truth which God has revealed. See the <a href="/isaiah/8-20.htm">Isaiah 8:20</a> note, and <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a> note.<p>Because many false prophets are gone out into the world - The word prophet is often used in the New Testament to denote religious instructors or preachers. See the notes at <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. Such false teachers evidently abounded in the times here referred to. See the notes at <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>. The meaning is, that many had gone out into the world pretending to be true teachers of religion, but who inculcated most dangerous doctrines; and it was their duty to be on their guard against them, for they had the very spirit of antichrist, <a href="/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>1Jo 4:1-21.

The apostle having mentioned the word "spirit" in the latter part of the preceding chapter, takes an occasion from thence to return to what he had been suggesting in the "second" chapter, concerning the many antichrists that then were, and whom he points out, and here cautions against. By "every spirit" he means, either every doctrine that is pretended to come from the Spirit of God, or every teacher, who professes to be qualified and sent by him, and to have his light, knowledge, and doctrine from him. Every true minister of the Gospel has the Spirit, and the gifts of the Spirit, more or less, to qualify him for his work; he is separated, and called to it by him, and receives his spiritual light find knowledge from him; it is he that teaches him sound doctrine, and leads him into all truth, as it is in Jesus, and brings every necessary truth to his remembrance; and who succeeds his ministrations to the good of souls: but there are some who call themselves the ministers of the Gospel, who, though they may have some natural abilities, and a share of human learning, and a notional knowledge of things, yet have never received either grace or gifts from the Spirit; nor have they been ever called by him; nor are their ministrations according to that divine word which is inspired by him, nor attended with his demonstration and power; wherefore, though some professing to have the Spirit of Christ are to be believed, yet not everyone; and though the Spirit is not to be quenched in any, nor prophesying to be despised, yet care should be taken what is heard and received: some persons are so obstinate and incredulous as not to believe anything that is declared, be the evidence what it will; as the Jews would not believe Christ and his apostles, though what they said agreed with Moses and the prophets, and was confirmed by miracles; and others are too credulous; at once receive every teacher, and embrace every upstart doctrine: this they should not do, <p>but try the spirits whether they are of God; not by human reason, especially as carnal and unsanctified; for though the doctrines of the Gospel are not contrary to true reason, they are above it, and not to be judged of by it, and are disapproved of and rejected by carnal reason; but by the word of God, which is the standard of all doctrine; and whatever agrees with that is to be received, and what does not should be rejected. And so to do is very commendable, as appears from the instance of the Beraeans, who on this account are said to be more noble than those of Thessalonica, <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>; and from the commendation of the church at Ephesus, <a href="/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>. And this is what every believer, every private Christian should do; to them it belongs to read and search the Scriptures, and prove all things, and judge for themselves of the truth of doctrine; and to such a probation or trial of the spirits, spiritual light, knowledge, judgment, sense, experience, and divine guidance are necessary, which should be asked of God, and an increase thereof; and all such diligent searchers, and humble inquirers, are capable of making judgment of persons and doctrines, whether they are from the Spirit of God or not, for the Spirit of God never speaks contrary to his word: and the reason why such a trial should be made is, <p>because many false prophets are gone out into the world: such who pretended either to a revelation of future things, and to foretell things to come; or rather to a gift of prophesying, or preaching in Christ's name, to be "prophets" and spiritual men, and ministers of the word, but were "false" ones; who either predicted what did not come to pass, or rather preached false doctrine, by corrupting the word, and handling it deceitfully, and so imposed upon and ruined the souls of others, as well as deceived their own: and there were not only one, or two, or a few of these, but "many", as our Lord had foretold, <a href="/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a>; and which makes the reason the stronger for not believing every spirit, but trying them; and the rather, since they were not sent of God, hot called out by his churches, but were "gone out" of themselves; of their own heads, and without any mission from God or man: and "into the world" too; they were in every part of it, and especially where there were any churches of Christ; into which they first crept in privily, and at unawares, but afterwards became public preachers of the word, and then separating from them, set up openly in the world for themselves. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> Beloved, believe not every <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</span><p>(1) Taking occasion by the name of the Spirit, lest love and charity should be separated from the worship of God, which chiefly depends on his true knowledge, he returns to that which he spoke of in the second chapter concerning the taking heed of antichrists: He will have us here take heed of two things, the one is, that seeing there are many false prophets, we should not trust every man: the other is, that because many men teach false things, we should not therefore believe any.

The apostle first exhorts them not to believe <span class="greekheb">παντὶ πνεύματι</span>. The idea <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is in closest connection with <span class="greekheb">ψευδοπροφῆται</span>. The <span class="ital">true</span> prophets spoke, as we read in <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2 Peter 1:21</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ πνεύματος ἁγίου φερόμενοι</span>; the source of the revelations which they proclaim (<span class="greekheb">πρόφημι</span>) is the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span> or <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, by which is meant not an affection of their mind, but the power of God, distinct from their own personality, animating and determining them (<span class="greekheb">δύναμις ὑψίστου</span>, synonymous with <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span>, <a href="/luke/1-35.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.">Luke 1:35</a>). This <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> speaks through the prophet, penetrating into his <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> and communicating to him the truth to be revealed; thus the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of the prophet himself becomes a <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>. As every prophet has his own <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, there exists, though the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span> is a single being, a plurality of prophetic spirits. The same relationship holds good, on the other hand, in the case of the false prophets. These also are under the influence of a spirit, namely, of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> which <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ ἔστι</span>, of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης</span>; this similarly is a single being, but inasmuch as with its lie it penetrates the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματα</span> of the false prophets and makes them like itself, it is true of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of every individual prophet that it is not of God, not a <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας</span>, but a <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης</span>. As John speaks here of a plurality of spirits (<span class="greekheb">παντὶ πνεύματι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ πνεύματα</span>), we are to understand by <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in this passage not the higher spirit different from the human spirit, but this spirit itself, penetrated, however, and filled with the former[253] (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-32.htm" title="And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.">1 Corinthians 14:32</a>, and Meyer on this passage). This spirit, however, may be spoken of, not merely in plurality, but also in unity, that is, in collective sense, for on each of the two sides all <span class="greekheb">πνεῦματα</span>, being animated by one and the same spirit,—whether the divine or that which is against God,—are of <span class="ital">one</span> nature, and so form together one unity.

Herein ye get to know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesseth Jesus as Christ come in flesh, is from God; and every spirit which confesseth not Jesus, is not from God.

From this we get to know the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The Apostle has just said that the Spirit begets in us the assurance that God abideth in us. And this suggests a warning. The Cerinthian heresy also had much to say about “the spirit”. It boasted a larger spirituality. Starting with the philosophical postulate of an irreconcilable antagonism between matter and spirit, it denied the possibility of the Incarnation and drew a distinction between Jesus and the Christ (see Introd., p. 157). Its spirit was not “the Spirit of Truth” but “a spirit of error,” and thus the necessity arises of “proving the spirits”. <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζειν</span>, of “proving” or “testing” a coin (<span class="greekheb">νόμισμα</span>).

The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1–6</span>. This section is an amplification of the sentence with which the preceding chapter ends. We certainly have the Holy Spirit as an abiding gift from God, for otherwise we could not believe and confess the truth of the Incarnation. As usual, S. John thinks and teaches in antitheses. The test which proves that we have the Spirit of God proves that the antichrists have not this gift but its very opposite. In chap. 2 the antichrists were introduced as evidence of the transitoriness of the world (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>): here they are introduced as the crucial negative instance which proves that every true believer has the Spirit of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Beloved</span>] See on <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1 John 3:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">believe not every spirit</span>] This exhortation does not give us the main subject of the section, any more than ‘Marvel not, brethren, if the world hate you’ (<a href="/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.">1 John 3:12</a>) gave us the main subject of the last section (<a href="/context/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous....">1 John 3:12-24</a>). In both cases the exhortation is introductory and momentary. Having spoken of the Spirit by which we know that God abides in us, the Apostle goes on to speak of other spiritual influences which indubitably exist, and of which every one has experience, but which are not necessarily of God because they are spiritual. “He does not discredit the fact that spiritual influences were widely diffused; he does not monopolize such influences for the Christian Church. How could he discredit this fact? How can we? Are there not myriads of influences about us continually, which do not act upon our senses but upon our spirits, which do not proceed from things which may be seen and handled, but from the spirits of men?” (Maurice). But besides ordinary spiritual influences, S. John probably has in his mind those extraordinary and supernatural powers which at various periods of the Church’s history persons have claimed to possess. Such claims exhibit themselves in professed revelations, prophecies, miracles, and the like. About all such things there are two possibilities which must put us on our guard: (1) they may be unreal; either the delusions of fanatical enthusiasts, or the lies of deliberate impostors: (2) even if real, they need not be of God. Miraculous powers are no absolute guarantee of the possession of truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">try the spirits</span>] Or, as R. V., <span class="ital">prove the spirits</span>. There are two words in N. T. meaning ‘to try, test, prove’; the one which we have here (<span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζειν</span>), and the one which is used where the Jews try or tempt Christ (<a href="/mark/8-11.htm" title="And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.">Mark 8:11</a>; <a href="/mark/10-2.htm" title="And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.">Mark 10:2</a>, &c.), and of the temptations of Satan (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-3.htm" title="And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.">Matthew 4:3</a>, &c.). The former occurs about 20, the latter about 40 times in N. T. Neither are common in S. John’s writings: he nowhere else uses the word which we have here, and the other only 4 times (<a href="/john/6-6.htm" title="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.">John 6:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-2.htm" title="I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can not bear them which are evil: and you have tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars:">Revelation 2:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm" title="Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.">Revelation 3:10</a>). The A. V. is very capricious in its renderings of the former; ‘allow’ (<a href="/romans/14-22.htm" title="Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that comdemns not himself in that thing which he allows.">Romans 14:22</a>), ‘approve’ (<a href="/romans/2-18.htm" title="And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;">Romans 2:18</a>), ‘discern’ (<a href="/luke/12-56.htm" title="You hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that you do not discern this time?">Luke 12:56</a>), ‘examine’ (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-28.htm" title="But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>), ‘like’ (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>), ‘prove’ (<a href="/luke/14-19.htm" title="And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray you have me excused.">Luke 14:19</a>), ‘try’ (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>); while the latter is rendered ‘examine’ (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>), ‘prove’ (<a href="/john/6-6.htm" title="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.">John 6:6</a>), ‘tempt’ (<a href="/matthew/22-18.htm" title="But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt you me, you hypocrites?">Matthew 22:18</a>), ‘try’ (<a href="/revelation/2-2.htm" title="I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can not bear them which are evil: and you have tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars:">Revelation 2:2</a>). The Revisers have somewhat reduced this variety. In the one case ‘allow’ has been changed to ‘approve’; ‘examine’ and ‘try’ to ‘prove’: in the other case ‘examine’ has been changed to ‘try’. The difference between the two words (which are found together <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?">2 Corinthians 13:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/26-2.htm" title="Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.">Psalm 26:2</a>) is on the whole this, that the one here used commonly implies a good, if not a friendly object; to prove or test in the hope that what is tried will stand the test: whereas the other often implies a sinister object; to try in the hope that what is tried will be found wanting. The metaphor here is from testing metals. Comp. ‘<span class="ital">Prove</span> all things; hold fast that which is good’ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whether they are of God</span>] Whether their origin (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>) is from God: comp. <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1 John 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.">1 John 3:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A verse such as this cuts at the root of such pretensions as the Infallibility of the Pope. What room is left for Christians to ‘prove the spirits’, if all they have to do is to ask the opinion of an official? The Apostle’s charge, ‘prove <span class="ital">ye</span> the spirits’, may be addressed to Christians singly or to the Church collectively: it cannot be addressed to an individual. Comp. <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-10.htm" title="Proving what is acceptable to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1 Corinthians 10:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered?">1 Corinthians 11:13</a>. The verse also shews us in what spirit to judge of such things as the reported miracles at Lourdes and the so-called ‘manifestations’ of Spiritualism. When they have been proved to be real, they must still further be proved to see ‘whether they are of God’. We are not to judge of doctrine by miracles, but of miracles by doctrine. A miracle enforcing what contradicts the teaching of Christ and His Apostles is not ‘of God’ and is no authority for Christians. Comp. <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm" title="But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:8</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,...">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because many false prophets</span>] The caution is against no imaginary or merely possible danger; it already exists. Warnings respecting the coming of such had been given by Christ, S. Paul, S. Peter, and S. Jude; and now S. John tells his readers that these prophecies have been fulfilled. These ‘false prophets’ include the antichrists of <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>, and what is here said of them seems to indicate that like Mahomet, Swedenborg, the Irvingites, and others, they put forth their new doctrine as a <span class="ital">revelation</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are gone out into the world</span>] This probably has no reference to their ‘going out from us’ (<a href="/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1 John 2:19</a>). Possibly it means no more than that they have appeared in public; but it perhaps includes the notion of their having a <span class="ital">mission</span> from the power that sent them: comp. <a href="/john/3-17.htm" title="For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.">John 3:17</a>; <a href="/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14</a>; <a href="/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>; <a href="/john/11-27.htm" title="She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.">John 11:27</a>; <a href="/john/12-47.htm" title="And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.">John 12:47</a>; <a href="/john/12-49.htm" title="For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.">John 12:49</a>, and especially <a href="/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a>. We need not confine these ‘many false prophets’ to the antichrists who had left the Christian communion. There would be others who, like Apollonius of Tyana, had never been Christians at all: and others even more dangerous who still professed to be members of the Church. The difficulties in the Church of Corinth caused by the unrestrained ‘speaking with tongues’ point to dangers of this kind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1 John 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παντὶ</span>) <span class="ital">every spirit</span>, which presents itself.—<span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span>) <span class="ital">spirit</span>, by which any teacher is influenced.—<span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζετε</span>, <span class="ital">try</span>) according to the rule, which is given in <a href="/context/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:...">1 John 4:2-3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ</span>) <span class="ital">many</span>, as at other times, so in that age also.

"The spirits" are principles and tendencies in religion: these need to be tested, for earnestness and fervour are no guarantee of truth. And to test these principles is the duty of the individual Christian as well as of the Church in its official capacity. Just as every Athenian was subjected to an examination <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as to his origin and character before he could hold office, so the spirit of every religious teacher must be examined before his teaching can be accepted.

Besides Cerinthus and other Gnostics, there were the Nicolaitanes, astrologers, professors of magic, and dealers in charms, some of which seem to have had their origin in Ephesus, for they were known as "Ephesian letters." Apollonius of Tyana was eagerly welcomed at Ephesus, and it is not impossible that his visit took place during St. John's lifetime. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beloved<p>Again the recognition of danger from false spirits prompts this affectionate address.
