Nothing could be more significant of St. John’s teaching. Here many trains of thought which have occurred before are gathered together in one grand treatise on love, divine and human—the complement of the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians. The thought of (<span class= "ital">a</span>) was suggested, though not in so complete and concise a form, in <a href="/context/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1John 3:10-11</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1John 3:23</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1John 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.">1John 3:6</a>; that of (<span class= "ital">b</span>) in <a href="/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1John 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>; that of (c) also in <a href="/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1John 3:16</a>; that of (<span class= "ital">d</span>) in <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1John 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm" title="And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.">1John 3:24</a>; that of (<span class= "ital">e</span>) in <a href="/context/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1-2</a>; that of (<span class= "ital">f</span>) in <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>; that of (<span class= "ital">g</span>) in <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1John 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1John 3:17</a>. The connection with the paragraph on the trial of the spirits is very obvious: “every one that loveth is born of God;” so that the quality and quantity of our affection will be the best gauge whether we have the spirit of truth or of error. The absence of love is ignorance of God, for real knowledge of Him imparts His nature. And if any ask how we know of His love, the answer is that it was seen in His Son. In sending Him, He loved us without any love on our part. Our relation to God reminds us that we must have the same love to each other. The fact that God cannot be seen is an additional reason for mutual affection among us; for brotherly love is the demonstrable proof of His presence, and of the growing completeness of the work wrought by His love in us. The Spirit Himself, through whom our love would come, confirms the reality of God’s indwelling. And these spiritual emotions and developments are not illusory, for they are guaranteed by the ocular and oral evidence of the Apostles to the historical Person of Christ. So the result of all this will be perfect and fearless confidence. To sum up (<a href="/1_john/4-19.htm" title="We love him, because he first loved us.">1John 4:19</a>): our love to God springs from His to us; hatred of our brother (or the absence of love for him) is the denial of all love for God; and for this duty we rest not on our own deductions only, however true, but on His plain command.<p>(7 <span class= "ital">a.</span>) (7) <span class= "bld">One another.</span>—As God loved the world, so we are to love mankind, not merely Christians. (Comp. <a href="/1_john/3-13.htm" title="Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hate you.">1John 3:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For love is of God.</span>—He who is truly alive shares the life of God, which is love. All true love is part of His being.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Knoweth not.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">never knew.</span> Real knowledge of God has a convincing practical effect; without such an effect it is not knowledge, but a mere mental deception.<p><span class= "bld">God is love.</span>—In the early part of the Epistle St. John had defined God as light, and the thoughts had been grouped round and in relation to that central idea. It would of course be impossible ever to exhaust all the definitions of God; but just as our nature may be roughly classified as intellectual and moral, mind and heart, thought and emotion, so, when we have thought of God as Light (embracing all such attributes as truth, knowledge, purity, health, power, and justice), we shall not have traversed in outline all that we can know of His nature, or all that concerns us to know, until we have also thought of Him as Love, the author and source of all true affection, kindness, pity, friendliness, rejoicing in the creation of infinite life for the sake of its infinite happiness, and offering eternal bliss to all His human family, that He may be for ever surrounded by inexhaustible illustrations of the joy and glory of perfection.<p>(7 b.) (9) <span class= "bld">In this was manifested</span>.—St. John echoes his beloved Lord (from <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">In us.</span>—(Comp. <a href="/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>.) “In our case.”<p><span class= "bld">Only begotten</span>.—In contrast to us, His adopted sons.<p><span class= "bld">That we might live</span>.—Human life is regarded as no true living, but a mere existence, until “Christ be formed in the heart” and we become “partakers of the divine nature.”<p>(10) <span class= "bld">Herein is love</span>.—What love is this, that, distasteful, uncongenial, unloving, unlovely as we must have been in His sight, He did this great thing for us!

Although our happiness depends strictly on God, still He has allowed us to be stewards for Him in some small degree for the happiness of those about us.<p>(7 <span class= "ital">d.</span>) (12) <span class= "bld">No man . . .</span>—St. John quotes his Gospel (<a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>). This is simply the general proposition, “God is invisible,” and has no reference to spiritual sight. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>; <a href="/john/6-46.htm" title="Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.">John 6:46</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1Timothy 6:16</a>.) The appearances of God to Abraham or Moses would be like the Shechinah in the Temple, but no material glimpse of Him who is a Spirit. St. John mentions the fact as an admission of the limits of human nature and the condition of faith, but only in order to state the richness of the substitute, which is the presence of God within the soul, verified and substantiated by the historical Person of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">His love is perfected in us</span>.—Its operation in us has full scope and sway.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Hereby know we.</span>—Comp. <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm" title="And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.">1John 3:24</a>.<p>(7 e.) A second antithesis to the opening words of <a href="/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1John 4:12</a>. The Apostolic witness to the person of Christ is again and again insisted on as the foundation of Christian theology. (Comp. <a href="/context/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1-3</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/4-20.htm" title="For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.">Acts 4:20</a>; <a href="/acts/22-15.htm" title="For you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.">Acts 22:15</a>; <a href="/acts/26-16.htm" title="But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear to you;">Acts 26:16</a>.)<p>(14) <span class= "bld">Saviour of the world.</span>—Comp. <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1John 2:2</a>.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Whosoever shall confess</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>receives the Apostolic witness as beyond dispute.

Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1John 4:6</a>; <a href="/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a>.) The noble width of this declaration is most remarkable, in opposition to human inventions of narrow and sectarian communions.<p><span class= "bld">Son of God,</span> in the sense of “only begotten,” as in <a href="/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.">1John 4:9</a>.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">And we have known and believed.</span>—This has the effect of a reflective repetition of <a href="/1_john/4-14.htm" title="And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.">1John 4:14</a>, “Yes. we have known and believed.” This time, however, the “we” includes those who have heard and accepted the testimony of the eye-witnesses.<p><span class= "bld">God is love.</span>—In this meditative recapitulation St. John cannot help summing up everything again in the boundless formula of <a href="/1_john/4-8.htm" title="He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.">1John 4:8</a>. Knowledge is here the process that leads to conviction; belief, the result of conviction.<p><span class= "bld">He that dwelleth in love.</span>—St. John’s whole purpose is none other than to raise man to his highest possible development by demonstrating the reality and nature of fellowship with the Divine. Here he arrives at the very central position of all: that as God is Love itself, so he that allows nothing to trouble that atmosphere of pure love (here neither specially towards God or man) which God would enable him to breathe, if his own wilfulness did not turn him away from it, will be bathed in the light of God, animated with His life, and one with Him. It is a combination of <a href="/1_john/4-8.htm" title="He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.">1John 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-15.htm" title="Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God.">1John 4:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Us</span> has the same width as <a href="/1_john/4-15.htm" title="Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God.">1John 4:15</a>.<p>(7 <span class= "ital">f</span>.) (17) <span class= "bld">Herein is our love made perfect.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">In this love is perfected with us. “</span>Love,” as in <a href="/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.">1John 4:16</a>, is the disposition to be attracted towards what is worthy of sympathy, whether it be God or man.<p><span class= "bld">That we may have boldness.</span>—The day of judgment, whether near or remote, is regarded as so certain that it is a present fact influencing our conduct. Love will be more or less perfect in us in proportion as it gives us more or less just and reasonable grounds for confidence were we suddenly placed before the great white throne. (Comp. <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Because as he is, so are we in this world.</span>—If we live in this serene atmosphere of pure sympathy with God and man, Christ is in us and we in Him, because God is Love itself. Sharing His nature, therefore, we must be like Him, and the more completely we allow this Divine love towards our Father and our brothers to transform our whole being, the more we shall be like our Judge, and the less cause we shall have for dread.<p><span class= "bld">In this world</span> merely indicates our present place of habitation.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">There is no fear.</span>—The more perfect this disposition of serene sympathy becomes, the less share can any form of anxiety have in it. Even if regarded as directed to an earthly object, if it be pure and divine in its character, not even want of reciprocity can disturb its equanimity. Where it is a well-grounded sympathy with a perfect being, its serenity is all the more complete in proportion to its sincerity. When love is perfect, fear dwindles to nothing, is absolutely expelled. Love, seeking to be perfect, and finding fear alongside of it, will diligently seek out the cause of the fear, perfect itself by getting rid of the cause, and so get rid of the fear. Fear in such a connection implies some ground for alarm, and suffers punishment (not “torment”) by anticipation. The presence of such a ground for alarm would imply a proportionate imperfection of love. (Comp. <a href="/context/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1John 3:19-21</a>.)<p>(7 <span class= "ital">g.</span>)<span class= "ital"> The cause of our love to God, and the necessary connection of that love with love to our fellows</span> (<a href="/context/1_john/4-19.htm" title="We love him, because he first loved us.">1John 4:19-21</a>).<p>(19) <span class= "bld">We love him, because he first loved us.</span>—God’s loving us made it possible for us to love Him: otherwise we should not have known Him, or had the faculty of loving Him even had we known Him. To suppose that St. John is putting a mere case of gratitude is to rob him of the dignity and depth of his meaning.<p>(20) These last three verses are a recapitulation in a vivid form, of the truth and the duty contained in <a href="/context/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1John 4:10-11</a>. God made it possible for us to love Him, and the very first result of our feeling this power within us, and allowing it to put itself into force will be seen in pure and devout sympathy for all whom we can help. As usual, hating, and not loving, are put as interchangeable members of the class of malevolence. St. John argues on the ground that it is much easier for human nature to be interested by what comes before its eyes than by that about which it has to think. Gregory the Great says, “In love the eyes are guides;” and Œcumenius, “Sight leads on to love.” (Comp. <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1John 2:4</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_john/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God....">1 John 4:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let us love one another </span>— From the doctrine he has just been defending, he draws this exhortation: as if he had said, Think it not enough speculatively to admit the Christian doctrine, but let it be your great care to acknowledge it practically, and especially with respect to that most important article, brotherly love. The frequency and earnestness with which the apostle, in the present epistle, inculcates this love, is very remarkable. The greatest part of this chapter, and of chapter 3., is employed in pressing this duty. See also <a href="/context/1_john/2-8.htm" title="Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines....">1 John 2:8-11</a>. <span class="ital">For love is of God </span>— Is from him as its source, and particularly enjoined by him as a duty of the greatest importance, and of absolute necessity, in order to our pleasing and imitating him. <span class="ital">And every one that loveth is born of God </span>— Every one, in whose heart this divine principle reigns, and conquers the selfish and contrary passions, shows by it that he is regenerated and transformed into the divine image; <span class="ital">and </span>that he <span class="ital">knoweth God </span>— By the teaching of his Holy Spirit, as the God of love, infinitely amiable in himself, and infinitely loving to his people. On the other hand, <span class="ital">he that loveth not, </span>whatever he may pretend, <span class="ital">knoweth not God </span>— Has no experimental and saving knowledge of him; <span class="ital">for God is love </span>— Its great fountain and exemplar. He enjoins it by his law, and produces and cherishes it by the influences of his Spirit; and the due contemplation of him will naturally inflame our hearts with love to his divine majesty, and to our fellow-creatures for his sake, whose creatures they are, and especially to his children, who love him, bear his image, and are peculiarly dear to him. This little sentence, <span class="ital">God is love, </span>brought St. John more sweetness, even in the time he was writing it, says Bengelius, than the whole world can bring. God is often styled holy, righteous, wise; but not holiness, righteousness, or wisdom, in the abstract, as he is said to be love: intimating that this is his darling, his reigning attribute; the attribute that sheds an amiable glory on all his other perfections.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 The Spirit of God is the Spirit of love. He that does not love the image of God in his people, has no saving knowledge of God. For it is God's nature to be kind, and to give happiness. The law of God is love; and all would have been perfectly happy, had all obeyed it. The provision of the gospel, for the forgiveness of sin, and the salvation of sinners, consistently with God's glory and justice, shows that God is love. Mystery and darkness rest upon many things yet. God has so shown himself to be love, that we cannot come short of eternal happiness, unless through unbelief and impenitence, although strict justice would condemn us to hopeless misery, because we break our Creator's laws. None of our words or thoughts can do justice to the free, astonishing love of a holy God towards sinners, who could not profit or harm him, whom he might justly crush in a moment, and whose deserving of his vengeance was shown in the method by which they were saved, though he could by his almighty Word have created other worlds, with more perfect beings, if he had seen fit. Search we the whole universe for love in its most glorious displays? It is to be found in the person and the cross of Christ. Does love exist between God and sinners? Here was the origin, not that we loved God, but that he freely loved us. His love could not be designed to be fruitless upon us, and when its proper end and issue are gained and produced, it may be said to be perfected. So faith is perfected by its works. Thus it will appear that God dwells in us by his new-creating Spirit. A loving Christian is a perfect Christian; set him to any good duty, and he is perfect to it, he is expert at it. Love oils the wheels of his affections, and sets him on that which is helpful to his brethren. A man that goes about a business with ill will, always does it badly. That God dwells in us and we in him, were words too high for mortals to use, had not God put them before us. But how may it be known whether the testimony to this does proceed from the Holy Ghost? Those who are truly persuaded that they are the sons of God, cannot but call him Abba, Father. From love to him, they hate sin, and whatever disagrees with his will, and they have a sound and hearty desire to do his will. Such testimony is the testimony of the Holy Ghost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beloved, let us love one another - This verse introduces a new topic, the consideration of which occupies the remainder of the chapter. See the Analysis. The subject is one on which John dwells more than on any other - that of love. His own character especially inclined him to the exercise of love; and the remarkable affection which the Lord Jesus had shown for him, seems to have had the effect to give this grace a special prominence in his views of what constituted true religion. Compare <a href="/john/13-23.htm">John 13:23</a>. On the duty here enjoined, see the <a href="//biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a> notes, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a> notes.<p>For love is of God - <p>(1) All true love has its origin in God.<p>(2) real love shows that we have his Spirit, and that we belong to him.<p>(3) it assimilates us to God, or makes us more and more like him.<p>What is here said by the apostle is based on the truth of what he elsewhere affirms, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>, that God is love. Hatred, envy, wrath, malice, all have their source in something else than God. He neither originates them, commends them, nor approves them.<p>And everyone that loveth, is born of God - Is a regenerated man. That is, everyone who has true love to Christians as such, or true brotherly love, is a true Christian. This cannot mean that everyone that loves his wife and children, his classmate, his partner in business, or his friend - his house, or his farms, or his horses, or his hounds, is a child of God; it must be understood as referring to the point under discussion. A man may have a great deal of natural affection toward his kindred; a great deal of benevolence in his character toward the poor and needy, and still he may have none of the love to which John refers. He may have no real love to God, to the Saviour, or to the children of God as such; and it would be absurd for such a one to argue because he loves his wife and children that therefore he loves God, or is born again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Resumption of the main theme (1Jo 2:29). Love, the sum of righteousness, is the test of our being born of God. Love flows from a sense of God's love to us: compare 1Jo 4:9 with 1Jo 3:16, which 1Jo 4:9 resumes; and 1Jo 4:13 with 1Jo 3:24, which similarly 1Jo 4:13 resumes.

If love is of God, then he who lives in love must also be born of God and know Him. The relation of <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ γεγεννῆσθαι</span> is not to be defined thus, that the former is the condition of the latter (de Wette), but thus, that the former is to be regarded as the criterion of the latter; to be born of God does not follow from love, but love follows from being born of God. The same relationship exists also between <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷν</span> and <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν τὸν Θεόν</span>;[262] what sort of a knowledge of God is meant, however, is seen from the close connection of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΙΝΏΣΚΕΙ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ ΓΕΓΈΝΝΗΤΑΙ</span></span></span>.—<a href="/1_john/4-8.htm" title="He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.">1 John 4:8</a>.

For the correct explanation, see Lücke, Braune, Weiss.

The Blessedness of Love. “Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and every one that loveth of God hath been begotten and is getting to know God. He that loveth not did not get to know God, because God is love. Herein was manifested the love of God in us, because His Son, His only-begotten, hath God commissioned into the world, that we may get life through Him. Herein is the love, not that <span class="ital">we</span> have loved God, but that <span class="ital">He</span> loved us and commissioned His Son as a propitiation for our sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Beloved, if it was thus that God loved us, we also are bound to love one another. God—no one hath ever yet beheld Him: if we love one another, God abideth in us and His love is perfected in us. Herein we get to know that we abide in Him and He in us, because of His Spirit He hath given us. And we have beheld and testify that the Father hath commissioned the Son as Saviour of the world. Whosoever confesseth that Jesus is the Son of God, God in him abideth and he in God. And we have got to know and have believed the love which God hath in us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“God is love, and he that abideth in love in God abideth, and God in him abideth. Herein hath love been perfected with us—so that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment—because, even as He is, we also are in this world. Fear there is not in love, but the perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth hath not been perfected in love. <span class="ital">We</span> love because <span class="ital">He</span> first loved <span class="ital">us</span>. If one say, ‘I love God,’ and hate his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, God whom he hath not seen, he cannot love.

The transition seems abrupt, as if the Apostle had summarily dismissed an unwelcome subject. But the connexions of thought in S. John’s writings are often so subtle, that it is rash to assert anywhere that two consecutive verses or sections are entirely without connecting links. Two such links may be found here. 1. The power to love one another, no less than the power to confess the Incarnation, is the gift of the Spirit (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us....">1 John 4:12-13</a></span>). And faith and love mutually aid one another. This is the case even between man and man. Faith and trust soon pass into love. 2. The antichristian spirit is a selfish one; it makes self, i.e. one’s own intellect and one’s own interest, the measure of all things. Just as it severs the Divine from the human in Christ, so it severs Divine love from human conduct in man. ‘Beloved, let us do far otherwise. Let us love one another’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the third and last time in this Epistle the Apostle introduces the subject of brotherly love. First it was introduced as a consequence and sign of walking in the light (<a href="/context/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning....">1 John 2:7-11</a>). Next it was introduced as a special form of righteousness and mark of God’s children (<a href="/context/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother....">1 John 3:10-18</a>). Here it appears as a gift of the Spirit of God, a contrast to the antichristian spirit, and above all as an effluence from the very Being of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Love one another’ here, as in <a href="/1_john/3-11.htm" title="For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.">1 John 3:11</a>, applies primarily to the mutual love of <span class="ital">Christians</span>. The love of Christians to unbelievers is not expressly excluded, but it is not definitely before the Apostle’s mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">love is of God</span>] And ‘we are of God’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1 John 4:6</a></span>), and ‘ye are of God’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1 John 4:4</a></span>); therefore there should be the family bond of love between us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every one that loveth is born of God</span>] This follows from the preceding statement. If God is the source of all love, then whatever love a man has in him comes from God; and this part of his moral nature is of Divine origin. Of ‘<span class="ital">every one</span> that loveth’ is this true, whether he be heathen or Christian: there is no limitation. If a Socrates or a Marcus Aurelius loves his fellow-men, it is by the grace of God that he does so. See concluding note on <a href="/1_john/3-4.htm" title="Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.">1 John 3:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">knoweth God</span>] He comes by experience to know Him by thus sharing the Divine nature.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀγαπῶμεν</span>, <span class="ital">let us love</span>) From that very doctrine, which he has just defended, he now derives an exhortation to love.
