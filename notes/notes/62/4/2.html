<span class="ital">know ye the Spirit of God</span> — In a teacher. <span class="ital">Every spirit </span>— Of a teacher; <span class="ital">that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God </span>— Doddridge, with many other commentators, reads this clause, <span class="ital">Every spirit that confesseth Jesus Christ, who is come in the flesh, is of God: </span>that is, that confesseth him to be the Messiah, the Son of God, the Saviour of the world, and that both with heart and voice, sincerely believing him to be such, and behaving to him and confessing him as such, though this might expose them to the loss of all things, even of their property, liberty, and lives. This must be acknowledged to be a perfectly Scriptural and very proper mark of trial, proving those in whom it was found to be possessed of the Spirit of God and of Christ. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged, though the original words, <span class="greekheb">ο ομολογει Ιησουν Χριστον εν σαρκι εληλυθοτα</span>, might bear this rendering, they much more favour the sense given them in our translation, signifying, literally and exactly, <span class="ital">that confesseth Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh. </span>This imports two things: 1st, That Jesus is the Christ, whose coming was foretold by the Jewish prophets, in opposition to the unbelieving Jews; a truth which those who confessed, whether in Judea or in the Gentile countries, exposed themselves to the danger of having their goods spoiled, and their bodies imprisoned, if not also tortured and put to death. So that those who voluntarily made this confession, manifested that they preferred Christ and his gospel to all other things whatever. The clause imports, 2d, That this great personage, the Messiah, the Son of God, had really <span class="ital">come in the flesh, </span>and had a real human nature, in opposition to a sect which arose very early in the Christian Church, called the <span class="ital">Docetæ, </span>who would not allow that Christ had a real body, and that he really suffered, died, and rose again. This sect St. John seems to have had in his eye throughout this epistle. Hence, in the very beginning of it, he speaks of <span class="ital">seeing, hearing, </span>and <span class="ital">handling </span>Christ; and here, to the fundamental article of Jesus’s being the Messiah, he adds, that he <span class="ital">came in the flesh; </span>with which doctrine his atoning for sin by the sacrifice of himself, and his rising from the dead, the first-fruits of them that sleep, were closely and necessarily connected, and therefore the acknowledgment of it was a point of the greatest importance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Socinians indeed contend, that to confess Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh, means simply to confess that he was a mere man: and from this they infer that he had no existence before he was conceived of his mother. In proof of their sense of the clause, they cite <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>, where the writer says he <span class="ital">partook of our flesh and blood. </span>Now, though it may be true that these words import nothing more than that Christ was a man, like other men, St. John’s words, <span class="ital">hath come in the flesh, </span>have evidently a more extensive meaning. For, as Bishop Horsley observes, the sense of a proposition ariseth, not from the meaning of a single word contained in it, but from the union of the whole into one sentence, especially if that union suggests any circumstance by which the sense of the proposition is modified. This is the case of the clause, <span class="ital">hath come in the flesh; </span>words which, while they specify the manner of his coming, imply that he might have come in a different manner if he had pleased. Accordingly the apostle hath used the verb <span class="ital">to come </span>in that sense <a href="/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1 John 5:6</a>. <span class="ital">This is he who came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by the water and the blood. </span>For his meaning plainly is, that Jesus came attested as the Christ by water and blood jointly, although he might have come attested by either of these separately; and that Jesus existed as the Christ before he came attested by the water and the blood. Thus the clause, <span class="ital">hath come in the flesh, </span>implies that he might have come in another manner than in the flesh, namely, in the form of God, as mentioned <a href="/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Php 2:6-7</a>. It implies that he existed before he came in the flesh, and chose to come in that manner, rather than in any other; consequently that he is more than a mere man. That Jesus Christ might have come in another manner, was the opinion of Clemens Romanus, one of the apostolical fathers mentioned <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Php 4:3</a> : for in his epistle to the Corinthians, he saith, “The sceptre of the majesty of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, came not in the pride of pomp and arrogance, although he had it in his power; but in humility, as the Holy Spirit spake concerning him.” See Macknight, and Bishop Horsley’s 5th letter to Priestley.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Christians who are well acquainted with the Scriptures, may, in humble dependence on Divine teaching, discern those who set forth doctrines according to the apostles, and those who contradict them. The sum of revealed religion is in the doctrine concerning Christ, his person and office. The false teachers spake of the world according to its maxims and tastes, so as not to offend carnal men. The world approved them, they made rapid progress, and had many followers such as themselves; the world will love its own, and its own will love it. The true doctrine as to the Saviour's person, as leading men from the world to God, is a mark of the spirit of truth in opposition to the spirit of error. The more pure and holy any doctrine is, the more likely to be of God; nor can we by any other rules try the spirits whether they are of God or not. And what wonder is it, that people of a worldly spirit should cleave to those who are like themselves, and suit their schemes and discourses to their corrupt taste?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hereby - Greek, "By this;" that is, by the test which is immediately specified.<p>Know ye the Spirit of God - You may discern who are actuated by the Spirit of God.<p>Every spirit - Everyone professing to be under the influence of the Spirit of God. The apostle uses the word "spirit" here with reference to the person who made the claim, on the supposition that everyone professing to be a religious teacher was animated by some spirit or foreign influence, good or bad. If the Spirit of God influenced them, they would confess that Jesus Christ had come in the flesh; if some other spirit, the spirit of error and deceit, they would deny this.<p>That confesseth - That is, that makes a proper acknowledgment of this; that inculcates this doctrine, and that gives it a due place and prominence in his instructions. It cannot be supposed that a mere statement of this in words would show that they were of God in the sense that they were true Christians; but the sense is, that if this constituted one of the doctrines which they held and taught, it would show that they were advocates of truth, and not apostles of error. If they did not do this, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>, it would be decisive in regard to their character and claims.<p>That Jesus Christ is come in the flesh - Benson and some others propose to render this, "That Jesus, who came in the flesh, is the Christ." But this is liable to serious objections.<p>(1) it is not the obvious interpretation.<p>(2) it is unusual to say that Jesus "had come in the flesh," though the expression "the Son of God has come in the flesh," or "God was manifested in the flesh," would be in accordance with the usage of the New Testament.<p>(3) this would not, probably, meet the real point in the case. The thing denied does not appear to have been that Jesus was the Messiah, for their pretending to be Christian teachers at all implied that they admitted this; but that the Son of God was "really a man," or that he actually assumed human nature in permanent union with the divine. The point of the remark made by the apostle is, that the acknowledgment was to be that Christ assumed human nature; that he was really a man as he appeared to be: or that there was a real incarnation, in opposition to the opinion that he came in appearance only, or that he merely seemed to be a man, and to suffer and die. That this opinion was held by many, see the Introduction, Section III. 2. It is quite probable that the apostle here refers to such sentiments as those which were held by the "Docetae;" and that he meant to teach that it was indispensable to proper evidence that anyone came from God, that he should maintain that Jesus was truly a man, or that there was a real incarnation of the Son of God. John always regarded this as a very important point, and often refers to it, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34-35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25-27</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>. It is as important to be held now as it was then, for the fact that there was a real incarnation is essential to all just views of the atonement. If he was not truly a man, if he did not literally shed his blood on the cross, of course all that was done was in appearance only, and the whole system of redemption as revealed was merely a splendid illusion. There is little danger that this opinion will be held now, for those who depart from the doctrine laid down in the New Testament in regard to the person and work of Christ, are more disposed to embrace the opinion that he was a mere man; but still it is important that the truth that he was truly incarnate should be held up constantly before the mind, for in no other way can we obtain just views of the atonement.<p>Is of God - This does not necessarily mean that everyone who confessed this was personally a true Christian, for it is clear that a doctrine might be acknowledged to be true, and yet that the heart might not be changed; nor does it mean that the acknowledgment of this truth was all which it was essential to be believed in order that one might be recognised as a Christian; but it means that it was essential that this truth should be admitted by everyone who truly came from God. They who taught this held a truth which he had revealed, and which was essential to be held; and they thus showed that they did not belong to those to whom the name "antichrist" could be properly given. Still, whether they held this doctrine in such a sense, and in such connection with other doctrines, as to show that they were sincere Christians, was quite another question, for it is plain that a man may hold and teach the true doctrines of religion, and yet have no evidence that he is a child of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

His flesh implies His death for us, for only by assuming flesh could He die (for as God He could not), Heb 2:9, 10, 14, 16; and His death implies His LOVE for us (Joh 15:13). To deny the reality of His flesh is to deny His love, and so cast away the root which produces all true love on the believer's part (1Jo 4:9-11, 19). Rome, by the doctrine of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, denies Christ's proper humanity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He here gives them the general rule, both affirmative and negative, which would suffice them to judge by in their present case; this being the great controversy of that time with the Jews: Whether Jesus were the Messiah? And whether the Messiah were as yet come or no? And with the Gnostics: Whether he were really come in the flesh, in true human nature? Or were not, as to that appearance, a mere phantasm? And he affirms: They that confessed him so come, were of God; i.e. thus far they were in the right, this truth was of God. Of the two litigating parties, this was of God, the other not of God; this took his side, that was against him. Yea, and they that not only made this true confession, but did also truly confess him, i.e. sincerely, cordially, practically, so as accordingly to trust in him, subject and devote themselves to him, were born of God, his very children, acted and influenced hereunto by his own Holy Spirit, as <span class="bld"><a href="/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1Jo 5:1</a>,5 Mt 16:16,17 <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_john/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God,.... This is a rule by which believers may know whether a man professing to have the Spirit of God, and to be called and sent by him, and whether the, doctrine he preaches, is of him or not: <p>every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,  <p>is of God; or of the Spirit of God; that is, every doctrine which carries this truth in it; or every man that owns, and professes, and publishes this doctrine concerning Christ, is on the side of God and truth; and which contains several articles in it, respecting the person and office of Christ; as that he existed before he came in the flesh, not in the human nature, or as man, or as an angel, but as the Son of God, as a divine person, being truly and properly God; so that this confession takes in his divine sonship, and proper deity, and also his true and real humanity; that the Messiah was incarnate, against the Jews, and was God and man in one person; and that he was really man, and not in appearance only, against the heretics of those times: and it also includes his offices, as that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ, the Messiah, which the Jews denied, and that he was the anointed prophet, priest, and King; and so is a confession or acknowledgment of all the doctrines of the Gospel, which came by him, as a prophet; and of his satisfaction, sacrifice, and intercession, as a priest; and of all his ordinances and commands as a King; and that he is the only Saviour and Redeemer of men. Now, whoever owns and declares this system of truth, "is of God"; not that everyone that assents unto this, or preaches it, is born of God; a man may believe, and confess all this, as the devils themselves do, and yet be destitute of the grace of God; but the spirit, or doctrine, which contains these things in it, is certainly of God, or comes from him; or whoever brings these truths with him, and preaches them, he is, so far as he does so, on the side of God and truth, and to be regarded. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Every spirit that confesseth that <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Jesus Christ is come in the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> flesh is of God:</span><p>(2) He gives a certain and perpetual rule to know the doctrine of antichrist, that is, if either the divine or human nature of Christ, or the true uniting of them together is denied: or if the least jot that may be, be detracted from his office who is our only king, prophet and everlasting high priest.<p>(b) He speaks simply of the doctrine, and not of the person.<p>(c) The true Messiah.<p>(d) Is true man.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a>.

The form of the object is explained by the polemic against Docetism; it is to be translated <span class="ital">either:</span> “<span class="ital">Jesus Christ as come in the flesh</span>” (Lücke, de Wette, Düsterdieck, Ebrard, etc.); <span class="ital">or:</span> “Jesus, as Christ come in the flesh;” the last interpretation has <span class="ital">this</span> advantage, that it not only brings out more clearly the reference to the <span class="ital">Cerinthian Docetism</span>,[254] but it makes it more easy to explain how the apostle in <a href="/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a> can designate the object simply by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ἸΗΣΟῦΝ</span></span></span>.

The commentators who deny the reference of the apostle to Docetism find themselves driven to artificial explanations; thus Socinus, who expands the participle by quamvis, and Grotius, according to whom <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span> refers to the status humilis in which Christ appeared, in contrast to the regia pompa in which the Jews expected the Messiah.[255] To exact unbelievers there can here be no reference, as, according to chap. <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>, the false prophets had previously belonged to the Church itself.[256] That John brings out as the token of the Spirit, that is, of God, just the confession of this particular truth, has its ground in the circumstances that have been mentioned; while it is also so very much the fundamental truth, that, as Lücke on ch. <a href="/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1 John 2:22</a> with justice says: “every <span class="greekheb">ψεῦδος</span> is contained in this and amounts to this, the denial of that truth in any sense.”[257]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[254] In the first interpretation the antithesis to the Corinthian Docetism lies not merely in the combination of <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν</span> as one name (Ebrard), but also in this, that this subject so described, which contains in it the idea <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>, is more particularly defined as having come in the flesh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[255] Socinus: Qui confitetur Jesum Christum i.e. eum pro suo servatore ac domino et denique vero Christo habet, <span class="ital">quamvis</span> is in carne venerit h. e. homo fuerit, non modo mortalis, sed infinitis malis obnoxius. Without any ground, Baumgarten-Crusius asserts: “If any force were to be assigned to the predicate: come in the flesh, the infinitive would have been used.”—Brückner thinks that if in ver. 3 the shorter reading (without the apposition) be the correct one, the reference to Docetism is here uncertain and unnecessary; but the uncertain expression is plainly to be interpreted in accordance with the more certain, and not, contrariwise, the latter in accordance with the former.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[256] Comp. with this passage Polycarp, <span class="ital">ep. ad Philipp.:</span> <span class="greekheb">πᾶς γὰρ ὃς ἂν μὴ ὁμολογῇ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυθότα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστός ἐστι καὶ ὃς μὴ ὁμολογῇ τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ σταυροῦ ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου ἐστί</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[257] Augustine peculiarly turns this sentence against the Donatists, whom he reproaches with a denial of their love, on account of their separation from the Catholic Church, when he says that John speaks here of a denial of Christ not merely by word, but also by deed: quisquis non habet charitatem negat Christum in carne venisse; so Bede: ipse est Spiritus Dei, qui dicit Jesum Christum in carne venisse, qui dicit non lingua, sed factis, non sonando, sed amando.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Hereby know ye</span>] Or, <span class="ital">Herein ye know</span>: the verb may be either indicative or imperative (comp. <a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>). The indicative is preferable, in spite of the imperatives in <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1 John 4:1</a></span> : comp. <a href="/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1 John 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm" title="And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.">1 John 3:24</a>, which are very closely parallel to this. ‘Ye know’ is literally ‘ye come to know, perceive, recognise’: ‘herein’ refers to what follows: see on <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1 John 3:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every spirit that confesseth</span>] This idea of ‘confessing’ one’s belief is specially frequent in S. John: <a href="/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>; <a href="/john/4-15.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.">John 4:15</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-7.htm" title="For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.">2 John 1:7</a>; <a href="/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>; <a href="/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh</span>] See on <a href="/2_john/1-7.htm" title="For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.">2 John 1:7</a>. This is the crucial test, and one which would at once expose ‘the spirits’ of Cerinthian and Docetic teachers. We are not to suppose that all other articles of faith are unimportant; or that to deny this truth is the worst of all denials (see on <a href="/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1 John 2:22</a>); or that such denial involves every kind of doctrinal error. But against the errors prevalent in that age this was the great safeguard. The confession must of course be not with the tongue only but in truth, and in deed as well as in word (<a href="/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1 John 3:18</a>): <span class="ital">non lingua sed factis, non sonando sed amando</span> (Bede).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sentence may be taken in more ways than one: (1) as both A. V. and R. V.; (2) more accurately, and with some difference of meaning; <span class="ital">confesseth</span> <span class="bld">Jesus Christ as come</span> <span class="ital">in the flesh</span>; (3) <span class="ital">confesseth</span> <span class="bld">that Jesus is the Christ</span> <span class="ital">come in the flesh</span>. Remark that S. John does not say ‘come <span class="ital">into</span> the flesh’, but ‘<span class="ital">in</span> the flesh’: Christ did not descend (as Cerinthus said) into an already existing man, but He came in human nature; He ‘<span class="ital">became</span> flesh’. Moreover he does not say that the confession is to be of a Christ who <span class="ital">came</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐλθόντα</span>), but of a Christ who <span class="ital">is come</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐληλυθότα</span>). This ‘coming’ is not an exhausted fact: He is come and abides in the flesh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>S. Paul gives almost exactly the same test: ‘I give you to understand that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit’ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is of God</span>] Proceeds from Him as its source: comp. <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>. “To confess that Jesus the anointed is come in the flesh, is to confess that there is a medium of spiritual communications between the visible and the invisible world, between earth and heaven. It is to confess that there is one Mediator for all men” (Maurice).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γινώσκετε</span>,[13] <span class="ital">ye know</span>) Respecting the heresies of that age there are recent and easily accessible writings: the Apostolic Church of Buddeus, and the Disputations of Lange, etc.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶν</span>, <span class="ital">every</span>) The discourse is respecting the spirits of that time: for at other times false prophets also impugned other heads of doctrine respecting Jesus Christ.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶν πνεῦμα</span>, <span class="ital">every spirit</span>) The Spirit of God is one only: but from Him every true teacher has his own peculiar inspiration, which is called <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, <span class="ital">spirit</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὁμολογεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">confesses</span>) with the assent of the heart and mouth.
