The sum of revealed religion is in the doctrine concerning Christ, his person and office. The false teachers spake of the world according to its maxims and tastes, so as not to offend carnal men. The world approved them, they made rapid progress, and had many followers such as themselves; the world will love its own, and its own will love it. The true doctrine as to the Saviour's person, as leading men from the world to God, is a mark of the spirit of truth in opposition to the spirit of error. The more pure and holy any doctrine is, the more likely to be of God; nor can we by any other rules try the spirits whether they are of God or not. And what wonder is it, that people of a worldly spirit should cleave to those who are like themselves, and suit their schemes and discourses to their corrupt taste?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And every spirit that confesseth not ... - That is, this doctrine is essential to the Christian system; and he who does not hold it cannot be regarded either as a Christian, or recognised as a Christian teacher. If he was not a man, then all that occurred in his life, in Gethsemane, and on the cross, was in "appearance" only, and was assumed only to delude the senses. There were no real sufferings; there was no shedding of blood; there was no death on the cross; and, of course, there was no atonement. A mere show, an appearance assumed, a vision, could not make atonement for sin; and a denial, therefore, of the doctrine that the Son of God had come in the flesh, was in fact a denial of the doctrine of expiation for sin. The Latin Vulgate here reads "qui solvit Jesum," "who dissolves or divides Jesus;" and Socrates (H. E. vii. 32) says that in the old copies of the New Testament it is written &#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;  ho liei ton Hie&#772;soun, "who dissolves or divides Jesus;" that is, who "separates" his true nature or person, or who supposes that there were "two" Christs, one in appearance, and one in reality. This reading was early found in some manuscripts, and is referred to by many of the Fathers, (see Wetstein,) but it has no real authority, and was evidently introduced, perhaps at first from a marginal note, to oppose the prevailing errors of the times. The common reading, "who confesseth not," is found in all the Greek manuscripts, in the Syriac versions, in the Arabic; and, as Lucke says, the other reading is manifestly of Latin origin. The common reading in the text is that which is sustained by authority, and is entirely in accordance with the manner of John.<p>And this is that spirit of antichrist - This is one of the things which characterize antichrist. John here refers not to an individual who should be known as antichrist, but to a class of persons. This does not, however, forbid the idea that there might be some one individual, or a succession of persons in the church, to whom the name might be applied by way of eminence.

In the reading: <span class="greekheb">ὁ μὴ ὁμολογεῖ τὸν Ἰησοῦν</span>, the article (which is not, with Lücke, to be deleted) must not be overlooked, for it indicates Jesus as the historical person who is Christ. The false teachers did not confess Jesus when they ascribed the work of healing, not to Jesus, but to the Aeon Christ. The particle <span class="greekheb">μή</span> indicates the <span class="ital">contradiction</span> of the true confession, whilst <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> would only express the simple negation. At the words: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου</span>, almost all commentators (even Brückner and Braune) supply with <span class="greekheb">τό</span> the word <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>; but Valla (with whom Zegerus agrees) interprets: et hic est antichristi spiritus, <span class="ital">vel potius:</span> et hoc est antichristi i.e. proprium antichristi; if this latter interpretation be correct, then <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> refers to <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὁμολογεῖν</span>, and <span class="greekheb">τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου</span> is “the antichristian nature.” As it is not easy to see why John should have left out <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, this interpretation is to be preferred to the usual one (so also Myrberg; Ewald similarly interprets: “the work of Antichrist;” the same form of expression in <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-24.htm" title="Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2 Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="/james/4-14.htm" title="Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.

According to Ebrard, the last sentence depends on <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>; this, however, is not likely, as <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> is the accusative; it is rather connected, as an independent sentence, with the preceding one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[258] Braune thinks that in these passages it was of importance to form a substantive conception, but that here the simple genitive would have been sufficient; it is plain, however, that the substantive idea <span class="greekheb">τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρ</span>. is here also more significant than a mere genitive connected with <span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>.

It was much appealed to in later days against Nestorius. The ecclesiastical historian Socrates (see crit. note) says it was the primitive reading, and was altered by “those who wished to separate the deity from the man of the Incarnation”. St. Augustine, defining heresy as schism due to lack of brotherly love, comments: “Ille venit colligere, tu venis solvere. Distringere vis membra Christi. Quomodo non negas Christum in carne venisse, qui disrumpis Ecclesiam Dei, quam ille congregavit? “On the Antichrist see note on <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἀκηκόατε ὅτι ἔρχεται</span>, “which ye have heard that it is coming”—the regular Greek idiom. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/luke/4-34.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us?

But, as we have repeatedly seen (<a href="/context/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all....">1 John 1:5-8</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-10.htm" title="If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.">1 John 1:10</a>, <a href="/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son....">1 John 2:22-23</a>, &c.), this is rarely the case in S. John’s oppositions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is yet another very ancient and very interesting difference of reading here: <span class="ital">every spirit which</span> <span class="bld">severeth</span> <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, or, <span class="ital">unmaketh Jesus</span>, or, <span class="ital">destroyeth Jesus</span>, or, as the margin of R. V., which <span class="ital">annulleth Jesus</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὃ λύει</span>, <span class="ital">qui solvit</span>), the verb which in <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.">1 John 3:8</a> is used for ‘to destroy’. This reading appears to have been known to Tertullian (a.d. 210), who quotes S. John as speaking of “the forerunners of Antichrist denying that Christ has come in the flesh and severing (<span class="ital">solventes</span>) Jesus” (<span class="ital">Adv. Marcion</span> V. xvi.), and to Irenaeus (a.d. 180), who quotes the whole passage, and in this place has “every spirit which severeth (<span class="ital">qui solvit</span>) Jesus” [<span class="ital">Haer.</span> III. xvi. 8). But it can scarcely be genuine, for it is <span class="ital">not found in a single Greek MS., nor in any version</span> except the Vulgate. And we have no certain knowledge that any Greek Father had this reading. ‘Qui solvit’ in Irenaeus may be interpretation rather than literal translation. Socrates the historian (a.d. 440) charges the Nestorians with tampering with the text and ignoring the reading ‘which <span class="ital">severeth</span> Jesus’; just as Tertullian accuses the Valentinians of falsifying the text of <a href="/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a>, and S. Ambrose the Arians of mutilating <a href="/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.">John 1:6</a>. In all these cases the supposed heretical reading is the right one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage in S. Polycarp’s Epistle already alluded to (see on <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>) is against the reading advocated by Socrates: ‘For every one who confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is an Antichrist; and whosoever confesseth not the witness of the Cross is of the devil’ (<span class="ital">Phil.</span> VII.). The expressions ‘confess’, ‘come in the flesh’, ‘Antichrist’, ‘is of the devil’, place S. Polycarp’s knowledge of his master’s First Epistle beyond all reasonable doubt. This is very early testimony (a.d. 140–155) to the existence of the First Epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The variations as regards reading are testimony to the same effect. Such things take time to arise and spread. If a corrupt reading is known to Tertullian in Africa, and (apparently) adopted by Irenaeus in Gaul, before the end of the second century, then the original document written in Asia Minor cannot be much later than the end of the first century, at which time S. John was still living.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is not of God</span>] S. John gives two tests, one for trying human conduct, and one for trying spiritual claims: ‘Every one that doeth not righteousness <span class="ital">is not of God</span>, neither he that loveth not his brother’ (<a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>); and ‘Every spirit which confesseth not Jesus <span class="ital">is not of God</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and this is that spirit of Antichrist</span>] ‘That’ should rather be ‘the’, as in R. V. The word ‘spirit’ is not expressed in the Greek, but is rightly understood from the context. The similar Greek expressions in <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-24.htm" title="Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>; <a href="/james/4-14.htm" title="Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.">James 4:14</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm" title="But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.">2 Peter 2:22</a> are not quite parallel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that it should come</span>] Better, with R. V., <span class="ital">that it</span> <span class="bld">cometh.</span> Wiclif and the Rhemish have ‘that <span class="ital">he cometh</span>’. Most English Versions before 1611 have ‘he’ for ‘it’; as also has Luther. This is due to the Vulgate, which has ‘Antichrist’ for ‘the (spirit) of Antichrist’. ‘It’ is certainly right. Not Antichrist, but the antichristian nature is affirmed to be <span class="ital">now in the world already</span>. The spirit of antagonism to Christ has passed from “the invisible world of spiritual wickedness” to the visible world of human action. The addition of ‘already’ hints that something more may be expected to follow. Comp. ‘The mystery of lawlessness doth already work’ (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ</span>) that is, <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, the spirit.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">and now</span>) ch. <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>, note.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every spirit</span> (not so much the personal teacher as the principle or tendency of the doctrine) <span class="cmt_word">which confesseth not Jesus.</span> This is the true reading, the words <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> being a spurious addition from verse 1. As so often, St. John states the case both negatively and positively for emphasis. There is an ancient variant reading of much interest, probably of Latin origin, which can be traced back to the second century, being known to Tertullian and Iranaeus. For <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> it gives <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">solvit Jesum.</span> This corruption of the text was evidently aimed at those who distinguished the man Jesus from the Divine Christ, and thus "dissolved" his Personality. The Greek manuscripts are quite unanimous against the reading. Is not of God; and therefore is of the evil one (see on 1 John 3:10). These professedly Christian teachers are ever among the most dangerous who treat the Divinity of Jesus Christ as more or less of an open question, or as a matter of indifference. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> probably means "the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of antichrist," understanding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> from the preceding clause rather than (quite vaguely) "the characteristic of antichrist" (see on 1 John 2:18, to which passage, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> does not refer, (but to Christian teaching in general). And now it is in the world already. This is an independent statement; St. John does not say that they had heard this previously. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Is come in the flesh<p>Omit.
