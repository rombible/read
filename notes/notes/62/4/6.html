The sum of revealed religion is in the doctrine concerning Christ, his person and office. The false teachers spake of the world according to its maxims and tastes, so as not to offend carnal men. The world approved them, they made rapid progress, and had many followers such as themselves; the world will love its own, and its own will love it. The true doctrine as to the Saviour's person, as leading men from the world to God, is a mark of the spirit of truth in opposition to the spirit of error. The more pure and holy any doctrine is, the more likely to be of God; nor can we by any other rules try the spirits whether they are of God or not. And what wonder is it, that people of a worldly spirit should cleave to those who are like themselves, and suit their schemes and discourses to their corrupt taste?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We are of God - John here, doubtless, refers to himself, and to those who taught the same doctrines which he did. He takes it for granted that those to whom he wrote would admit this, and argues from it as an indisputable truth. He had given them such evidence of this, as to establish his character and claims beyond a doubt; and he often refers to the fact that he was what he claimed to be, as a point which was so well established that no one would call it in question. See <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; <a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-12.htm">3 John 1:12</a>. Paul, also, not unfrequently refers to the same thing respecting himself; to the fact - a fact which no one would presume to call in question, and which might be regarded as the basis of an argument - that he and his fellow apostles were what they claimed to be. See <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1-11</a>. Might not, and ought not, all Christians, and all Christian ministers, so to live that the same thing might be assumed in regard to them in their contact with their fellow-men; that their characters for integrity and purity might be so clear that no one would be disposed to call them in question? There are such men in the church and in the ministry now; why might not all be such?<p>He that knoweth God, heareth us - Every one that has a true acquaintance with the character of God will receive our doctrine. John might assume this, for it was not doubted, he presumed, that he was an apostle and a good man; and if this were admitted, it would follow that those who feared and loved God would receive what he taught.<p>Hereby - By this; to wit, by the manner in which they receive the doctrines which we have taught.<p>Know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error - We can distinguish those who embrace the truth from those who do not. Whatever pretensions they might set up for piety, it was clear that if they did not embrace the doctrines taught by the true apostles of God, they could not be regarded as his friends; that is, as true Christians. It may be added that the same test is applicable now. They who do not receive the plain doctrines laid down in the word of God, whatever pretensions they may make to piety, or whatever zeal they may evince in the cause which they have espoused, can have no well-founded claims to the name Christian. One of the clearest evidences of true piety is a readiness to receive all that God has taught.

Not only as the chosen of God, the children of God, regenerated ones, and believers, but as ministers of the Gospel; they were chosen, and called, and sent of God to preach the Gospel, and were qualified for it, by gifts received from him, and had their doctrine from him, as well as their commission and mission: they were not of the world, and therefore did not speak of the world, nor things suited to worldly men; but being of God, they spoke the words of God, which were agreeable to him, which made for the glory of the three divine Persons, and were consistent with the divine perfections; which maintained the honour and dignity of the persons in the Godhead; which magnified the grace of God in salvation, and debased the creature: <p>he that knoweth God; not only as the God of nature and providence, but as in Christ, and that not only professionally, but practically; that has an experimental knowledge of him, that knows him as exercising lovingkindness, having tasted of his grace and goodness; that knows him so as to trust in him, and love him; for such a knowledge of God is meant, as has true real affection to him joined with it; so that it is he that loves his name, his glory, his truths, and his ordinances: he <p>heareth us: not only externally, constantly attending on the ministry of the word, as such do; but internally, understanding what is heard, receiving it in love, cordially embracing it, and firmly believing it, and acting according to it: <p>he that is not of God; who is not born of God, but is as he was when born into the world, and is of it: and who does not righteousness, nor loves his brother, nor confesses the divinity, humanity, and offices of Christ, and so is not on the side of truth, nor has the truth of grace in him; see <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>; such a man <p>heareth not us; he is a mere natural man, a carnal and unregenerate man; and such an one cannot attend on a Gospel ministry, or receive Gospel doctrines, which are with him senseless, stupid, and foolish notions, yea, foolishness itself; nor can he know and understand them through ignorance, and want, of a spiritual discerning; they are hard sayings, and he cannot hear, nor bear them; and when this is the case, it is a plain token of unregeneracy, and that such persons are not of God; see <a href="/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>. <p>Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error; the difference between truth and error; can distinguish one from another, and discern who are the true ministers of Christ, and who are the false teachers; for not only the word of God, the Scriptures of truth, are the test and standard, the touchstone to bring them to, and try them by; and the doctrines they severally bring show who they are; but even their very hearers distinguish them. Spirits, or men pretending to the Spirit of God, may be known in a great measure by their followers; they who have the spirit of error, and are of the world, they are followed, and caressed, and applauded by the men of the world, by unregenerate persons; they who have the spirit of truth, and are of God, they are heard and approved of, and embraced by spiritual men, by such who know God in Christ, and have tasted that the Lord is gracious. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us.

According to Lücke and others, the apostle means by this those to whom belongs the “<span class="ital">general</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ εἶναι</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the divine impress and instinct, which is <span class="ital">the condition of childhood of God in Christ;</span>” but the expression itself is opposed to this, for the knowledge of God is necessarily conditioned by faith in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the second clause: <span class="greekheb">ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὃς</span> … <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> forms the antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ὁ γινώσκων τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεόν</span>.

According to the usual view, with which Düsterdieck agrees, the sense of this passage is: He who hears the apostles shows thereby that the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας</span> is in him; he who, on the contrary, does not hear them, shows that the <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς πλάνης</span> is in him; it is in his relation to the apostolic teaching that any one shows of what spirit he is the child.[259] But, according to the train of thought in this section, it is not the spirit of the <span class="ital">hearers</span>, but that of the <span class="ital">teachers</span> that is the subject (so also Myrberg and Braune); the sense therefore is: That the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς πλάνης</span> prevails in the false prophets, may be known by this, that <span class="ital">the world</span> hears them; that in us, on the contrary, the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας</span> dwells, may be perceived by this, that those who know God, <span class="ital">i.e. the children of God</span>, hear us. The <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀληθείας</span> cannot be in him whom the world hears, nor can the <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς πλάνης</span> be in him whom the children of God hear; Braune: “the <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς πλάνης</span> is certainly in him whom the world hears, and the <span class="greekheb">πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀληθείας</span> in him whom the children of God hear.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς ἀληθείας</span>; comp. <a href="/john/14-17.htm" title="Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.">John 14:17</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>; a description of the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as He not only produces a knowledge of the truth, but “makes the truth His very nature” (Weiss).[260] <span class="greekheb">τὸ πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς πλάνης</span>, the spirit that emanates from the devil, which seduces men to falsehood and error; comp. chap. <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[259] Luther: “If we hear God’s true messengers, that is a plain token of true religion; if, however, we despise and mock them, that is a plain token of error.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[260] The thought of this passage corresponds with that of <a href="/context/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out....">John 10:3-5</a>, where Christ appeals for a proof that He is the Good Shepherd to the fact that the sheep know and hear His voice, whilst they do not know the voice of the stranger, and flee from it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us.

Conversely, those who are getting to know God, understand the language of His messengers and listen to it. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τούτου</span>, <span class="ital">i.e</span>, from their hearkening or not hearkening. Men’s attitude to the message of the Incarnate Saviour ranks them on this side or on that—on God’s side or the world’s.

It underlies the whole Epistle, as it does the whole of the Fourth Gospel, but here and there comes to the surface. It is the quiet confidence of conscious strength. Comp. ‘He that is of God heareth the words of God; for this cause ye hear them not because ye are not of God’; and, ‘Every one that is of the Truth heareth My voice’ (<a href="/john/8-47.htm" title="He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.">John 8:47</a>; <a href="/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then?
