The world draws the heart from God; and the more the love of the world prevails, the more the love of God decays. The things of the world are classed according to the three ruling inclinations of depraved nature. 1. The lust of the flesh, of the body: wrong desires of the heart, the appetite of indulging all things that excite and inflame sensual pleasures. 2. The lust of the eyes: the eyes are delighted with riches and rich possessions; this is the lust of covetousness. 3. The pride of life: a vain man craves the grandeur and pomp of a vain-glorious life; this includes thirst after honour and applause. The things of the world quickly fade and die away; desire itself will ere long fail and cease, but holy affection is not like the lust that passes away. The love of God shall never fail. Many vain efforts have been made to evade the force of this passage by limitations, distinctions, or exceptions. Many have tried to show how far we may be carnally-minded, and love the world; but the plain meaning of these verses cannot easily be mistaken. Unless this victory over the world is begun in the heart, a man has no root in himself, but will fall away, or at most remain an unfruitful professor. Yet these vanities are so alluring to the corruption in our hearts, that without constant watching and prayer, we cannot escape the world, or obtain victory over the god and prince of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Love not the world - The term "world" seems to be used in the Scriptures in three senses:<p>(1) As denoting the physical universe; the world as it appears to the eye; the world considered as the work of God, as a material creation.<p>(2) the world as applied to the people that reside in it - "the world of mankind."<p>(3) as the dwellers on the earth are by nature without religion, and act under a set of maxims, aims, and principles that have reference only to this life, the term comes to be used with reference to that community; that is, to the objects which they especially seek, and the principles by which they are actuated.<p>Considered with reference to the first sense of the word, it is not improper to love the world as the work of God, and as illustrating his perfections; for we may suppose that God loves his own works, and it is not wrong that we should find pleasure in their contemplation. Considered with reference to the second sense of the word, it is not wrong to love the people of the world with a love of benevolence, and to have attachment to our kindred and friends who constitute a part of it, though they are not Christians. It is only with reference to the word as used in the third sense that the command here can be understood to be applicable, or that the love of the world is forbidden; with reference to the objects sought, the maxims that prevail, the principles that reign in that community that lives for this world as contradistinguished from the world to come. The meaning is, that we are not to fix our affections on worldly objects - on what the world can furnish - as our portion, with the spirit with which they do who live only for this world, regardless of the life to come. We are not to make this world the object of our chief affection; we are not to be influenced by the maxims and feelings which prevail among those who do.

This explanation shows what John meant by "the things that are in the world." He does not say that we are in no sense to love "anything" that is in the material world; that we are to feel no interest in flowers, and streams, and forests, and fountains; that we are to have no admiration for what God has done as the Creator of all things; that we are to cherish no love for any of the inhabitants of the world, our friends and kindred; or that we are to pursue none of the objects of this life in making provision for our families; but that we are not to love the things which are sought merely to pamper the appetite, to please the eye, or to promote pride in living. These are the objects sought by the people of the world; these are not the objects to be sought by the Christian.<p>If any man love the world ... - If, in this sense, a person loves the world, it shows that he has no true religion; that is, if characteristically he loves the world as his portion, and lives for that; if it is the ruling principle of his life to gain and enjoy that, it shows that his heart has never been renewed, and that he has no part with the children of God.

Love not the world&#8212;that lieth in the wicked one (1Jo 5:19), whom ye young men have overcome. Having once for all, through faith, overcome the world (1Jo 4:4; 5:4), carry forward the conquest by not loving it. "The world" here means "man, and man's world" [Alford], in his and its state as fallen from God. "God loved [with the love of compassion] the world," and we should feel the same kind of love for the fallen world; but we are not to love the world with congeniality and sympathy in its alienation from God; we cannot have this latter kind of love for the God-estranged world, and yet have also "the love of the Father in" us.<p>neither&#8212;Greek, "nor yet." A man might deny in general that he loved the world, while keenly following some one of THE THINGS IN IT: its riches, honors, or pleasures; this clause prevents him escaping from conviction.<p>any man&#8212;therefore the warning, though primarily addressed to the young, applies to all.<p>love of&#8212;that is, towards "the Father."

The habitable earth, the world in which men live; this is not to be loved by saints, as if it was their habitation, where they are always to be, and so loath to remove from it, seeing they are but sojourners, and pilgrims, and strangers here; this is not their rest, nor dwellingplace, their continuing city, or proper country, that is heaven. Nor should they love the men of the world, who are as they came into it, are of it, and mind the things of it, and lie in wickedness, and are wicked men; for though these are to be loved, as men, as fellow creatures, and their good, both spiritual and temporal, is to be sought, and good is to be done to them, as much as lies in our power, both with respect to soul and body; yet their company is not to be chosen, and preferred to the saints, but to be shunned and avoided, as disagreeable and dangerous; their evil conversation, and wicked communications, are not to be loved, but abhorred, and their works of darkness are to be reproved; nor are their ways to be imitated, and their customs followed, or their manners to be conformed unto: <p>neither the things that are in the world; good men that are in the world, though they are not of the world, are to be loved; and the kingdom of Christ, though it is not of the world, yet it is in the world, and is to be regarded and promoted to the uttermost; and there are the natural and civil things of the world, called this world's goods, which may be loved within due bounds, and used in a proper manner, though they are not to be loved inordinately and abused. This is the character of worldly men; so the Jews call such,  , "such that love world" (g). Near relations and friends in the world, and the blessings of life, may be loved and enjoyed in their way, but not above God and Christ, or so as to take up satisfaction and contentment in them, to make idols of them, and put trust and confidence in them, and prefer them to spiritual and heavenly things, and be so taken with them, as to be unconcerned for, and careless about the other; but the evil things of the world, or at least the evil use of them, and affection for them, are here intended, as appears from the following verse. Now it is chiefly with respect to the fathers, and young men, that this exhortation is given; and the repetition of what is said to them before is made, to introduce this; which is exceeding suitable to their age and characters. Old men are apt to be covetous, and love the world and worldly things, just when they are going out of it, and about to leave them; and young men are apt to be carried away with lust, vanity, ambition, and pride: and therefore, from each of these, the apostle dissuades, from the following arguments, <p>if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; that is, "the love of God", as the Alexandrian copy and the Ethiopic version read; who is the Father of Christ, and of all the elect in him; and who is indeed, by creation, the Father of all men, the Father of spirits, of the souls of men, and of angels, and the Father of mercies and of lights, and by the love of him is meant, either the love with which he loves his people, and which being shed abroad in the heart, attracts the soul to himself, and causes it to love him above the world, and all things in it; and such an one esteems of it, and an interest in it, more than life, and all the enjoyments of it, and is by it loosened to the world, and sets light by it, and can part with all good things in it, and suffer all evil things cheerfully, under the constraints and influence of this love; so that it is a clear case, that when the affections of men are set upon the world, and they are glued to the things of it, their hearts are not warmed with a sense of the love of God, or, that is not sensibly in them, or shed abroad in their hearts: or else by the love of God is meant love to God, which is inconsistent with the love of the world, or with such an inordinate love of mammon, as to serve it; for a man may as soon serve two masters, as serve God and mammon, which he can never do truly, faithfully, and affectionately; and which also is not consistent with friendship with the men of the world, or a conversation and fellowship with them in things that are evil, whether superstition or profaneness; see <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>. <p>(g) Kimchi in Psal. xlix. 9.

The explanations that deviate from this are divided into three leading classes—(1) Those in which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΣΜΟς</span></span></span> is regarded as a total number of men indeed, but in a limited way; either = “the heathen world” (Lange), or more indefinitely: “the mass of common men” (Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΣΥΡΦΕΤῸς ὌΧΛΟς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ὃς Οὐ ΤῊΝ ΤΟῦ ΠΑΤΡῸς ἜΧΕΙ ἈΓΆΠΗΝ ἘΝ ἙΑΥΤῷ</span></span></span>; Calovius: homines dediti rebus hujus mundi), or “the greater part of men” (Grotius: humanum genus, secundum <span class="ital">partem majorem</span>, quae in malis actionibus versatur); Storr limits the idea here “to that part of the world which the antichristians constituted.” (2) Those which understand <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> not of the human world itself, but of the evil dwelling in it; so says the Scholiast: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΣΜΟΝ ΤῊΝ ΚΟΣΜΙΚῊΝ ΦΙΛΗΔΟΝΊΑΝ ΚΑῚ ΔΙΆΧΥΣΙΝ ΛΈΓΕΙ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἧς ἘΣΤῚΝ ἌΡΧΩΝ Ὁ ΔΙΆΒΟΛΟς</span></span></span>; Luther: “the world, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> godlessness itself, through which a man has not the right use of the creatures;” to this class belong also the explanations of Calvin, Morus, S. Schmid, Semler;[133] but in this abstract sense the word never appears elsewhere; and besides, taking this view, difficulties appear in the sequel which can only be overcome by arbitrary interpretations. (3) Those explanations in which <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is regarded as the total of perishable (actual) things; these things being regarded as purely physical, there lies in the idea <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, in and by itself, no ethical meaning, but this appears only through the <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷν</span> which is connected with it; the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> as a creature of God is in itself good and irreproachable, but the love to the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, through which man centres his affections on it, and makes it the single aim of his activity, is to be blamed, because amid all association with earthly things it is not they, but God, that must be loved; thus there results for the command: <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἀγαπᾶτε τὸν κόσμον</span>, certainly an appropriate idea; but what follows in <a href="/context/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world....">1 John 2:16-17</a> has induced almost all commentators who accept this view to give, nevertheless, to the idea <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> itself, more or less distinctly, an ethical reference; thus Lücke indeed says: “<span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος</span> is, as the sum total of the temporal and sensuous, in <span class="ital">contrast</span> (!) to the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, always only the objective sphere of evil, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to which it tends as ethical direction and disposition,” but immediately afterwards he explains the same idea “as the sum total of all sensuous appearances, which excite <span class="ital">the desire of the senses;</span>” still more definitely de Wette says: “the sum total of that <span class="ital">which attracts desire</span>, the temporal, sensuous, earthly—<span class="ital">regarded in contrast with God;</span>” but this connection of the ethical reference with the idea of actual things is itself rather unsuitable; not in the things, but in man himself, lies the cause of the seductive charm which things exercise upon him; besides, it is not possible to retain this conception of the word without modification to the end of the 17th verse.[134] It is true some commentators[135] distinctly say that John here makes a sort of play upon the word, but such an assumption does too much violence to the clearness and certainty of the thought for us to approve of it. The right view, therefore, is to take <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος</span> here in the same sense that the word prevailingly has throughout John’s works, so that it signifies the world lying <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῷ ΠΟΝΗΡῷ</span></span></span>. This <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΣΜΟς</span></span></span>, this is the meaning of the apostle’s warning, is not to be the object of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΆΠΗ</span></span></span> of believers. From this it follows that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΠᾷΝ</span></span></span> here means neither “to love too much,” nor “to love with unhallowed sense,” but love in the strictest sense of the word, consisting in a life of inner fellowship.[136]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μηδὲ τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span>] As <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is an ethical idea, natural objects as such cannot be meant by <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>., but only these in so far as they are taken by the ungodly world into its service; or better, the apparently good things which the world pursues, or with which it delights itself, and which therefore belong to it, as riches, honour, power, human wisdom, and such like. Ebrard erroneously understands thereby “the different kinds of sinful impulse, thought, and action, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> avarice, ambition, sensuality, and such like,” for either of these is plainly a love (although a false, unholy love) which cannot itself again be regarded as the object of love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις ἀγαπᾷ τὸν κόσμον</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] By this sentence the apostle confirms the previous exhortation, expressing the incongruity of love to the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> with the <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη τοῦ πατρός</span>; Bede: Unum cor duos tam sibi adversaries amores non capit. By <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη τοῦ πατρός</span> is to be understood neither the love of God to us (Luther II., Calovius), nor the charitas quam Pater praescribit (Socinus); but, as by far the most of commentators (Bede, Beza, Grotius, Vatablus, Spener, etc., and all the modern commentators, even Ebrard, despite his erroneous interpretation of <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a>), interpret, <span class="ital">love to God.</span>[137]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If <span class="greekheb">πατρός</span> is the correct reading, then the name Father is here to be explained from the filial relationship of Christians to God, and points to their duty not to love the world, but God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Between the two sorts of <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span> there is the same exclusive contrast as between the <span class="greekheb">Θεῷ δουλεύειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">μαμωνᾷ δουλεύειν</span>, <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

Selimid by: corruptio peccaminosa; Semler by: vulgata consuetudo hominum, res corporeas unice appetentium. Here may be enumerated also the interpretation of Erdmann: totus complexus et ambitus mali, quatenus hoc non solum toti generi humano, verum etiam propter hominum a Deo defectionem omnibus rebus humanis totique rerum naturae inhaeret.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[134] Thus Lücke finds himself compelled in the case of <span class="greekheb">πᾶν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span> to make an abstraction of the things themselves, and to understand thereby <span class="ital">their ethical reference;</span> and here results the certainly unjustifiable thought that this ethical reference of things has its origin in the things themselves (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου</span>). Still more decidedly, de Wette says that in the words <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου ἐστί</span>, ver. 16, “<span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος</span> is not regarded as the sum total of earthly things, but as the sensuous life alienated from God, or as the sum total of worldly men who enjoy this;” somewhat differently Brückner: “that the sum total of earthly evil, of the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, is here regarded rather of <span class="ital">real</span> things, is clear from the subordinate clause <span class="greekheb">μηδὲ τὰ ἐν τῷ κ</span>.; in ver. 16 the <span class="ital">personal</span> aspect prevails.” Neander, on ver. 16, equally deviates from the explanation which he had given of ver. 15; in the latter he regards <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος</span> as “the world and earthly things,” but in the former as “the predominating tendency of the soul to the world, the growing worldliness of the soul, which blends itself with the world.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[135] Thus a Lapide says (after he has assigned to the word three meanings, namely (1) homines mundani, in his proprie est concupiscentia; (2) orbis sublunaris, in hoe mundo proprie et formaliter non est eoncupiscentia; sed in eo est concupiscentia materialis i.e. objectum concupiscibile; (3) ipsa mundana vita vel concupiscentia in genere): omnibus hisce modis <span class="ital">mundus</span> hic accipi potest et Johannes nunc ad unum, nunc ad alterum respicit; <span class="ital">ludit</span> enim in voce mundus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[136] Lücke groundlessly thinks the idea of love must necessarily be weakened to that of “mere longing for,” if by <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> the human world is understood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[137] A combination of both interpretations: amor patris erga suos et filialis erga patrem (Bengel), is clearly unjustifiable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

A warning against love of the world, which is directed neither specially to the children (Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">ἐπτόηται γὰρ ἀεὶ τὰ παιδία περὶ τὸ φαινόμενον ἡδύ</span>), nor specially to the young men (Bengel, Semler, Besser), but to all (Bede: <span class="ital">omnibus</span> haec generaliter ecclesiae filiis scribit).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1 John 2:15</a>. He is dealing with believers who have a large experience of the grace of Christ, and on this fact he proceeds to base an appeal, a call to further advancement and higher attainment: “Love not the world”. Yet God “loved the world” (<a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>). Observe that the Apostle does not say that the world is evil. It is God’s world, and “God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good” (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm" title="And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.">Genesis 1:31</a>). His meaning is: “The things in the world are transient. Do not set your affection on them, else you will sustain a bitter disappointment. The world is a good and beautiful gift of God, to be used with joy and gratitude; but it is not the supreme end, it is not the home of our souls”. “Let the Spirit of God be in thee,” says St. Augustine, “that thou mayest see that all these things are good; but woe to thee if thou love created things and forsake the Creator!… If a bridegroom made a ring for his bride and, when she got it, she were fonder of the ring than of the bridegroom who made the ring for her, would not an adulterous spirit be detected in the very gift of the bridegroom, however she might love what the bridegroom gave?… God gave thee all those things: love Him who made them. There is more which He would fain give thee, to wit, Himself who made these things”. Again: “There are two loves—of the world and of God. If the love of the world inhabit, there is no way for the love of God to enter. Let the love of the world retire and that of God inhabit, let the better get room.… Shut out the evil love of the world, that thou mayest be filled by the love of God. Thou art a vessel, but thou art still full; pour out what thou hast, that thou mayest get what thou hast not”. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Πατρός</span>, like <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a>), either (1) “love for the Father,” in antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷ τὸν κόσμον</span>, or (2) “the love which the Father feels for us”. In fact the one implies the other. The sense of the Father’s love for us awakens in us an answering love for Him. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/1_john/4-19.htm" title="We love him, because he first loved us.">1 John 4:19</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">Love not the world</span>] The asyndeton is remarkable. S. John has just stated his premises, his readers’ happiness as Christians. He now abruptly states the practical conclusion, without any introductory ‘therefore’. As was said above on <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a></span>, we must distinguish between the various meanings of the Apostle’s favourite word, ‘world.’ In <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a> he tells us that ‘God loved the world’, and here he tells us that <span class="ital">we</span> must <span class="ital">not</span> do so. “S. John is never afraid of an apparent contradiction when it saves his readers from a real contradiction … The opposition which is on the surface of his language may be the best way of leading us to the harmony which lies below it” (Maurice). The world which the Father loves is the whole human race. The world which we are not to love is all that is alienated from Him, all that prevents men from loving Him in return. The world which God loves is His creature and His child: the world which we are not to love is His rival. The best safeguard against the selfish love of what is sinful in the world is to remember God’s unselfish love of the world. ‘The world’ here is that from which S. James says the truly religious man keeps himself ‘unspotted’, friendship with which is ‘enmity with God’ (<a href="/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">James 1:27</a>; <a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>). It is not enough to say that ‘the world’ here means ‘earthly things, so far as they tempt to sin’, or ‘sinful lusts’, or ‘worldly and impious men’. It means all of these together: all that acts as a rival to God; all that is alienated from God and opposed to Him, especially sinful men with their sinful lusts. ‘The world’ and ‘the darkness’ are almost synonymous; to love the one is to love the other (<a href="/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>): to be in the darkness is to be of the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither the things that are in the world</span>] Or, <span class="ital">nor yet the things, &c.</span>, i.e. ‘Love not the world; no, nor anything in that sphere.’ Comp. ‘Not to consort with … no, nor eat with’ (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>). ‘The things in the world’, as is plain from <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.">1 John 2:16</a></span>, are not material objects, which can be desired and possessed quite innocently, although they may also be occasions of sin. Rather, they are those elements in the world which are necessarily evil, its lusts and ambitions and jealousies, which stamp it as the kingdom of ‘the ruler of this world’ (<a href="/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>) and not the kingdom of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">If any man love the world</span>] Once more, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a></span>, the statement is made quite general by the hypothetical form: everyone who does so is in this case. The Lord had proclaimed the same principle; ‘No man <span class="ital">can</span> serve two masters … Ye <span class="ital">cannot</span> serve God and mammon’ (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Matthew 6:24</a>). So also S. James; ‘Whosoever would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God’ (<a href="/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1 John 4:4</a>). Comp. <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>. Thus we arrive at another pair of those opposites of which S. John is so fond. We have had light and darkness, truth and falsehood, love and hate; we now have love of the Father and love of the world. The world which is coextensive with darkness must exclude the God who is light. By writing ‘the love of the Father’ rather than ‘the love of God’ (which some authorities read here) the Apostle points to the duty of Christians as <span class="ital">children</span> of God. ‘The love of the Father’ (a phrase which occurs nowhere else) means man’s love to Him, not His to man: see on <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a></span>.

This is another form of darkness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Love not the world.</span> Obviously, both "love" and "the world" are used in a different sense in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where it is said that "God loved the world." The one love is selfish, the other unselfish. In the one case "the world" means the sinful elements of human life, in the other the human race. It is most important to distinguish the different meanings of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the New Testament. Connected with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="accented">comere</span>, it means <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> ornament (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the ordered universe, <span class="accented">mundus</span> (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the earth (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the inhabitants of the earth (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <span class="accented">all that is alienated from God</span>, as here and frequently in St. John's writings. <span class="cmt_word">The things of the world</span> are not those things in the world which may become objects of sinful affection, such as wealth or honour, still less such as scenery or physical objects. St. John is not condemning a love of those material advantages which are God's gifts, nor of nature, which is God's work. He is forbidding those things the love of which rivals and excludes the love of God - all those immoral tendencies and pursuits which give the world its evil character. The world <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is order; the things in the world are the elements of disorder - those things which arise from each man making himself the center of the world, or of some little world of his own creation. These rival centers clash with one another, and also with the one true Center. All this St. John forbids. With <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span> (<a href="/john/2-25.htm">John 2:25</a>).

As so often, St. John goes on to enforce his words by a negative statement of similar but not identical import. Love of the world absolutely excludes the love of the Father. "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." Some important authorities have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; the balance is decidedly for the latter. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The world (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>.<p>The love of the Father (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>The phrase occurs only here in the New Testament.

Westcott cites a parallel from Philo: "It is impossible for love to the world to coexist with love to God, as it is impossible for light and darkness to coexist." Compare Plato. "Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for there must always remain something which is antagonist to good. Having no place among the gods in heaven, of necessity they hover around the earthly nature, and this mortal sphere. Wherefore we ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like Him is to become holy and just and wise" ("Theaetetus," 176). </body></html>
