And as He, by being the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, had declared the universality of God’s family and kingdom, so the sympathy of believers would extend in different degrees as far as the whole human race; to those first who were conscious of the same hopes as themselves; to those next who might be brought to share them; to those, perhaps, in a less degree, who in every nation feared God and worked righteousness without knowing the Saviour personally; and so on, finally, to all who did not wilfully excommunicate themselves. But the brotherly love would be chiefly amongst Christian friends, else it would be diffused into nothingness.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">He that saith . . .</span>—The whole history of religious rancour has been a deplorable illustration of these words. Controversy for principles honestly and reasonably held is one thing: prejudice, spite, private censures and condemnations, harsh words, suspicions, jealousies, misunderstandings and misrepresentations are the chief props of the kingdom of darkness among Christian churches and nations.

But all such love is tinged with passion, and the desire of satisfying some personal lack; this is the pure disinterested seeking for another’s welfare, of which Christ was the great example. It is that which the modern scientific non-Christian world is trying to make its religion; but without the Christian motive, and cultivated for its own sake instead of by the working of the Spirit of God, it seems artificial and powerless.<p><span class= "bld">Occasion of stumbling.</span>—<span class= "ital">Stumbling</span> - <span class= "ital">blok.</span> (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-165.htm" title="Great peace have they which love your law: and nothing shall offend them.">Psalm 119:165</a>; <a href="/context/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

By expelling ill-will, pride, anger, immoderate selfishness, and all other evil passions, which are occasions of sin, love removes every stumbling-block lying in our way, and enables us to do our duty to our brethren in Christ, or to mankind in general, with ease and pleasure. <span class="ital">But he that hateth his brother </span>— And he must hate if he does not love him; there is no medium; <span class="ital">is in darkness </span>— In a state of spiritual blindness, of sin, perplexity, and entanglement.

And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that saith he is in the light - That he has true religion, or is a Christian.

T. expression, see Winer, p. 418, VII. p. 439; A. Buttmann, p. 275; there is no reason for supplying “even if he were a long time a Christian” (Ewald). “With the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span> is contrasted, <a href="/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ φωτὶ μένει</span>; see on this <a href="/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a>.[117] That the “exercise of brotherly love is itself a means of strengthening the new life” (Ebrard), is not contained in the idea <span class="greekheb">μένει</span>. Even if the idea of <a href="/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>—in relation to that of the 9th verse—is brought out more distinctly by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΙ</span></span></span>, this is much more done by the words: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΣΚΆΝΔΑΛΟΝ ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ ΟὐΚ ἜΣΤΙΝ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΣΚΆΝΔΑΛΟΝ</span></span></span> appears in the N. T. only in the ethical signification = “offence,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> that which entices and tempts to sin; in the case of <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, the preposition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> is generally either left unnoticed by the commentators (Grotius says, appealing to Psalms 119 : est metonymia et <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> abundat. Sensus: ille non impingit) or changed in meaning; de Wette: “<span class="ital">in his case</span> (for him) there is no stumbling; comp. <a href="/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.">John 11:9</a> ff.;” similarly Baumgarten-Crusius, Neander, etc.; Lücke even says: “<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> can here only signify the outer circle of life,” because “the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΚΆΝΔΑΛΑ</span></span></span> for the Christian lie in the world, and not in him;” with him Sander agrees. For such changes there is no ground, since in the usage of the word the figure (the snare, or rather the wood that falls in the snare) has quite given place to the thing, and it is therefore unnecessary to say, with Düsterdieck, that “in the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span> the thing itself penetrates into the otherwise figurative form of speech;” the offence may be outside a man, but it may be <span class="ital">in</span> him also; comp. <a href="/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell....">Matthew 5:29-30</a>. The preposition <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is here to be retained in its proper meaning (Düsterdieck, Ewald, Braune). The sense is: In him who loves his brother and thus remains in the light, there is nothing which entices him to sin. Some commentators refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΚΆΝΔΑΛΟΝ</span></span></span> to the temptation of <span class="ital">others</span> to sinning; so Vatablus: nemini offendiculo est; Johannsen: “he gives no offence;” Ebrard: “there is nothing in them by which they would give offence to the brethren,” etc.; but in the context there is no reference to the influence which the Christian exercises upon others, and if John had had this relationship in his mind, he would certainly have expressed it;[118] this is decisive also against Braune, who would retain both references. Paulus quite unwarrantably refers <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΦΏς</span></span></span>: “in that light nothing is a stumbling-block.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The beginning of the 11th verse repeats—in a form antithetical to <a href="/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>—that which was said in <a href="/1_john/2-9.htm" title="He that said he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.">1 John 2:9</a>; but with further continuation of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῇ ΣΚΟΤΊᾼ ἘΣΤΊΝ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first subordinate clause runs: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΝ Τῇ ΣΚΟΤΊᾼ ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖ</span></span></span>. The difference of the two clauses does not consist in this, that the representation passes over from the less figurative (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΤΊ</span></span></span>) to the more figurative (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖ</span></span></span>) (Lücke); for, on the one hand, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖΝ</span></span></span> is so often used of the ethical relationship of man, that it is scarcely any longer found as a figurative expression; and, on the other hand, the connection by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> shows that there is a difference of idea between the two expressions; this has been correctly thus described by Grotius: priori membro affectus (or better: habitus, Sander), altero actus denotatur (similarly de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Braune). Both: the being (the condition) and the doing (the result) of the unloving one belong to darkness; comp. <a href="/galatians/5-25.htm" title="If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.">Galatians 5:25</a>. The second subordinate clause: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟὐΚ ΟἾΔΕ ΠΟῦ ὙΠΆΓΕΙ</span></span></span>, is closely connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖ</span>; <span class="greekheb">ΠΟῦ</span></span></span>, properly a particle of rest, is in the N. T. frequently connected with verbs of motion; comp. <a href="/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>; <a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>; <a href="/john/20-13.htm" title="And they say to her, Woman, why weep you?

Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.">John 12:35</a> it runs exactly as here: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤῶΝ ἘΝ Τῇ ΣΚΟΤΊᾼ ΟὐΚ ΟἾΔΕ ΠΟῦ ὙΠΆΓΕΙ</span></span></span>. The translation: “where he is going,” is false, for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΆΓΕΙΝ</span></span></span> is not: “to go,” but: “<span class="ital">to go to.</span>” To the unloving one, the goal whither he is going on his dark way, and therefore the direction of his way, is unknown. By this goal it is not exactly the final goal, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> condemnation (Cyprian: it nescius in gehennam, ignarus et caecus praecipitatur in poenam), that is to be thought of, for the subject according to the context is not punishment; but by the figurative expression the apostle wants to bring out that the unloving one, not knowing whither, follows the impulse of his own selfish desire: he does not know what he is doing, and whither it tends. As a confirmation of this <span class="ital">last</span> idea, the apostle further adds: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἡ σκοτία ἐτύφλωσε τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ</span>; <span class="greekheb">τυφλοῦν</span> does not mean “to darken,” but “<span class="ital">to make blind, to blind;</span>” this idea is to be retained, and is not, with Lücke and others, to be enfeebled by an interpolated “tamquam, as” (“in the darkness they are as if blind”), by which the clause loses its meaning; the apostle wants to bring out that, inasmuch as the unloving one walks in the darkness, the sight of his eyes is taken from him by this darkness, so that he does not know, etc. He who lives in sin is blinded by sin, and therefore does not know whither his sin is leading him; comp. <a href="/john/12-40.htm" title="He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.">John 12:40</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[117] Köstlin incorrectly finds the reason why he who loves his brother remains in the light, in this, “that the Christian life of the individual requires for its own existence the support of all others.” Of such a support the apostle is not speaking here at all, but the truth of his statement lies rather in this, that <span class="ital">love</span> and <span class="ital">light</span> are essentially connected with one another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[118] When Ebrard finds no obstacle in the thought that he who loves his brother does not by any act give offence to others, he should find no obstacle in the thought that there is nothing in him which becomes an offence to himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/2-9.htm" title="He that said he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.">1 John 2:9</a>. He says and perhaps thinks he is in the light, but he has never seen the light; it has never shone on him. <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφόν</span>, on the lips of Jesus a fellow-man (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm" title="That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.">Matthew 5:45</a>; <a href="/luke/15-30.htm" title="But as soon as this your son was come, which has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf.">Luke 15:30</a>; <a href="/luke/15-32.htm" title="It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.">Luke 15:32</a>), in the apostolic writings a fellow-Christian (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

There is no contradiction between this passage and <a href="/luke/14-26.htm" title="If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:26</a>. The best commentary on the latter is <a href="/john/12-25.htm" title="He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.">John 12:25</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. For the fifth time the Apostle indicates a possible inconsistency of a very gross kind between profession and conduct (<a href="/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-10.htm" title="If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.">1 John 1:10</a>, <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a>). We shall have a sixth in <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>. In most of these passages he is aiming at some of the Gnostic teaching already prevalent. And this introduces a fresh pair of contrasts. We have had light and darkness, truth and falsehood; we now have love and hate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his brother</span>] Does this mean ‘his fellow-Christian’ or ‘his fellow-man’, whether Christian or not? The common meaning in N.T. is the former; and though there are passages where ‘brother’ seems to have the wider signification, e.g. <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>; <a href="/luke/6-41.htm" title="And why behold you the mote that is in your brother's eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?">Luke 6:41</a>; <a href="/james/4-11.htm" title="Speak not evil one of another, brothers. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.">James 4:11</a>, yet even here the spiritual bond of brotherhood is perhaps in the background. In S. John’s writings, where it does not mean actual relationship, it seems generally if not universally to mean ‘Christians’: not that other members of the human race are excluded, but they are not under consideration. Just as in the allegories of the Fold and of the Good Shepherd, nothing is said about goats, and in that of the Vine nothing is said about the branches of other trees; so here in the great family of the Father nothing is said about those who do not know Him. They are not shut out, but they are not definitely included. In <span class="ital">this Epistle</span> this passage, <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/3-14.htm" title="We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers.

There is a sin to death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.">1 John 5:16</a> the sinning ‘brother’ is certainly a fellow-Christian. In 2 John the word does not occur: <a href="/3_john/1-3.htm" title="For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.">3 John 1:3</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-5.htm" title="Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do to the brothers, and to strangers;">3 John 1:5</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-10.htm" title="Why, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.">3 John 1:10</a> confirm the view here taken. In the <span class="ital">Gospel</span> the word is generally used of actual relationship: but in the two passages where it is used otherwise it means Christians: in <a href="/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>, Christ speaks of the disciples as ‘My brethren’, and in <a href="/john/21-23.htm" title="Then went this saying abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?">John 21:23</a>, Christians are called ‘the brethren’. In the <span class="ital">Apocalypse</span>, omitting <a href="/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a> as doubtful, all the passages where the word occurs require the meaning ‘Christian’ (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>, <a href="/john/6-11.htm" title="And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.">John 6:11</a>, <a href="/john/12-10.htm" title="But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;">John 12:10</a>, <a href="/john/19-10.htm" title="Then said Pilate to him, Speak you not to me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?">John 19:10</a>). Note that throughout this Epistle the singular is used; ‘his <span class="ital">brother</span>’, not ‘his <span class="ital">brethren</span>’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is in darkness even until now</span>] Or, as in <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>, in order to bring out the full contrast with the light, <span class="ital">is in</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">darkness</span>. ‘Even until now’, i.e. in spite of the light which ‘is <span class="ital">already</span> shining’, and of which he has so little real experience that he believes light and hatred to be compatible. Years before this S. Paul had declared (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>), ‘If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, … but have not love, I am nothing.’ The light in a man is darkness until it is warmed by love. The convert from heathendom who professes Christianity and hates his brother, says S. Augustine, is in darkness even until now. “There is no need to expound; but to rejoice if it be not so, to bewail, if it be.” The word for ‘now’ (<span class="greekheb">ἄρτι</span>) is specially frequent in S. John’s Gospel: it indicates the present moment not absolutely, but in relation to the past or the future. The peculiar combination, ‘even until now’ (<span class="greekheb">ἕως ἄρτι</span>) occurs <a href="/john/2-10.htm" title="And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.">John 2:10</a>; <a href="/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>; <a href="/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-12.htm" title="And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.">Matthew 11:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-13.htm" title="Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things to this day.">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>, a fact much obscured in A.V. by the variety of renderings; ‘until now’, ‘hitherto’, ‘unto this day’, ‘unto this hour’, ‘unto this present’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">9–11</span>. The form of these three verses is similar to that of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments....">1 John 2:3-5</a></span>, and still more so to <a href="/context/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us....">1 John 1:8-10</a>. In each of these three triplets a case is placed between two statements of the opposite to it; confession of sin, obedience, and love, between two statements of denial of sin, disobedience, and hate. But in none of the triplets do we go from one opposite to the other and back again: in each case the side from which we start is restated in such a way as to constitute a distinct advance upon the original position. There is no weak tautology or barren see-saw. The emphasis grows and is marked by the increase in the predicates.

These verses set forth in a variety of forms the affinity between love and light, hatred and darkness, and the consequent incompatibility between hatred and light. "Hate" <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not to be watered down into "neglect" or "fail to love." St. John knows nothing of such compromises. Love is love, and hate is hate, and between the two there is no neutral ground, any more than between life and death, or between Christ and antichrist. "He that is not with me is against me." "Love is the moral counterpart of intellectual light. It is a modern fashion to represent these two tempers as necessarily opposed. But St. John is at once earnestly dogmatic and earnestly philanthropic; for the Incarnation has taught him both the preciousness of man and the preciousness of truth" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith.</span> For the fifth time St. John points out a glaring inconsistency which is possible between profession and fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6, 8, 10</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a>.9); cf. <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>. In all these passages the case is put hypothetically; but in some of the Gnostic teaching of the age this inconsistency existed beyond a doubt. Is in darkness even until now. His supposing that hatred is compatible with light proves the darkness in which he is. Nay, more, it shows that, in spite of his having nominally entered the company of the children of light, he has really never left the darkness. "If ye loved only your brethren, ye would not yet be perfect; but if ye hate your brethren, what are ye? where are ye?" (St. Augustine). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hateth (&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The sharp issue is maintained here as in Christ's words, "He that is not with me is against me" (<a href="/luke/11-23.htm">Luke 11:23</a>). Men fall into two classes, those who are in fellowship with God, and therefore walk in light and love, and those who are not in fellowship with God, and therefore walk in darkness and hatred. "A direct opposition," says Bengel; where love is not, there is hatred. "The heart is not empty." See <a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>; <a href="/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>; <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a> sqq.; <a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14</a>. The word hate is opposed both to the love of natural affection (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;), and to the more discriminating sentiment - love founded on a just estimate (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;). For the former see <a href="/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>; compare <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>.
