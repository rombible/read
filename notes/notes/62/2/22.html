Let this prophecy that seducers would rise in the Christian world, keep us from being seduced. The church knows not well who are its true members, and who are not, but thus true Christians were proved, and rendered more watchful and humble. True Christians are anointed ones; their names expresses this: they are anointed with grace, with gifts and spiritual privileges, by the Holy Spirit of grace. The great and most hurtful lies that the father of lies spreads in the world, usually are falsehoods and errors relating to the person of Christ. The unction from the Holy One, alone can keep us from delusions. While we judge favourably of all who trust in Christ as the Divine Saviour, and obey his word, and seek to live in union with them, let us pity and pray for those who deny the Godhead of Christ, or his atonement, and the new-creating work of the Holy Ghost. Let us protest against such antichristian doctrine, and keep from them as much as we may.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is a liar - That is, who is false; who maintains an erroneous doctrine; who is an impostor, if he is not? The object of the apostle is to specify one of the prevailing forms of error, and to show that, however plausible the arguments might be by which it was defended, it was impossible that it should be true. Their own knowledge of the nature of religion must convince them at once that this opinion was false.<p>That denieth that Jesus is the Christ - It would seem that the apostle referred to a class who admitted that Jesus lived, but who denied that he was the true Messiah. On what grounds they did this is unknown; but to maintain this was, of course, the same as to maintain that he was an impostor. The ground taken may have been that he had not the characteristics ascribed to the Messiah in the prophets; or that he did not furnish evidence that he was sent from God; or that he was an enthusiast. Or perhaps some special form of error may be referred to, like that which is said to have been held by Corinthus, who in his doctrine separated Jesus from Christ, maintaining them to be two distinct persons. - "Doddridge."<p>He is antichrist - (See the notes at <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). He has all the characteristics and attributes of antichrist; or, a doctrine which practically involves the denial of both the Father and the Son, must be that of antichrist.<p>That denieth the Father and the Son - That denies the special truths pertaining to God the Father, and to the Son of God. The charge here is not that they entertained incorrect views of God "as such" - as almighty, eternal, most wise, and good; but that they denied the doctrines which religion taught respecting God as Father and Son. Their opinions tended to a denial of what was revealed respecting God as a Father - not in the general sense of being the "Father" of the universe, but in the particular sense of his relation to the Son. It cannot be supposed that they denied the existence and perfections of God as such, nor that they denied that God is a "Father" in the relation which he sustains to the universe; but the meaning must be that what they held went to a practical denial of that which is special to the true God, considered as sustaining the relation of a Father to his Son Jesus Christ. Correct views of the Father could not be held without correct views of the Son; correct views of the Son could not be held without correct views of the Father. The doctrines respecting the Father and the Son were so connected that one could not be held without holding the other, and one could not be denied without denying the other. Compare the <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a> note; <a href="/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23</a> note. No man can have just views of God the Father who has not right apprehensions of the Son. As a matter of fact in the world, people have right apprehensions of God only when they have correct views of the character of the Lord Jesus Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. a liar&#8212;Greek, "Who is the liar?" namely, guilty of the lie just mentioned (1Jo 2:21).<p>that Jesus is the Christ&#8212;the grand central truth.<p>He is Antichrist&#8212;Greek, "the Antichrist"; not however here personal, but in the abstract; the ideal of Antichrist is "he that denieth the Father and the Son." To deny the latter is virtually to deny the former. Again, the truth as to the Son must be held in its integrity; to deny that Jesus is the Christ, or that He is the Son of God, or that He came in the flesh, invalidates the whole (Mt 11:27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Especially may the ill accord be discerned between Divine truth and a lie, when the lie is so directly levelled against the foundations upon which the whole fabric is built, as the denying Jesus to be the Christ strikes at all. And though he that doth so, seems not only an <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">antichrist</span> as directing his opposition but against Christ, he really as much <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">denieth the Father, </span> who testified of him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?.... Or that very Christ, and true Messiah, who was spoken of by all the prophets, since the beginning of the world, and so much, and so long desired by the Old Testament saints: he that denies that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah of the prophets, is not indeed the only liar in the world, but he is the greatest of liars; this is a consummate lie, being opposed to a glaring truth, to a fact clear an indisputable; and which rests not merely on the testimony of Jesus, who is truth itself, and who, in express words, more than once, declared and asserted himself to be the Christ; but all the characters of the Messiah, everything that is said of him in the Prophets, meet in Jesus, and the miracles which were done by him are flagrant proofs and undeniable evidences of his being the Christ of God; and all the apostles believed, and were sure that he was Christ, the Son of the living God: to which may be added the testimony of John, who was sent, and came to bear witness of him, and did; and who was a prophet, and a man of great probity and integrity. But there was a greater witness than he; even God himself, by a voice from heaven, bore a testimony to him; and angels, at his incarnation, declared him to be the Saviour, which is Christ the Lord; yea, the devil himself, who is a liar, and the father of ties in other things, knew and owned Jesus to be the Christ; so that those that deny him are the worst of liars, even worse than the devil himself. This may have regard not only to the Jews, that deny Jesus to be the Messiah, but chiefly to such who went by the name of Christians; who denied either his proper deity, or real humanity, as Ebion and Cerinthus, which was denying him to be the God-man, the Mediator, and Messiah; and is true of all such that deny him in any of his offices, or in things relating to them, as his Gospel, and any of the peculiar doctrines of it, delivered by him, and so deny his prophetic office; or any of his ordinances, institutions, and appointments, as lawgiver in his house, and King of saints, and so deny him in his kingly office; or reject him as the alone Saviour, joining their own works with him, in the business of salvation, and oppose his sacrifice and satisfaction, and despise his imputed righteousness, and so deny him in his priestly office. Now these are some of the liars, and these some of the doctrinal lies, which are not of the truth, as in 1Jo_2:21. <p>He is antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son: that denies the Father of Christ to be the Creator of the world, but asserts that it was made by angels, as some ancient heretics did; or that the Father of Christ is not the God of the Old Testament, as Marcion; or that denies that God is the Father of Christ, and that Christ is the Son of God; who will not allow that there is any such relation in nature between them; who affirm that Christ is only the Son of God by adoption, or because of his love to him, or because of his incarnation and resurrection from the dead; or that he is not his true and proper Son, only in a figurative and metaphorical sense; that he is not the natural and eternally begotten Son of God, only by office, and as Mediator, and that God is only his Father, as having installed him into an office; or he that denies that these two are distinct from each other, but affirms that Father is the Son, and the Son is the Father, and so confounds them both, and, by confounding both, denies that there are either Father or Son; and all such persons are antichrists, or opposers of Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{23}</span> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> Christ?

The existence of the antichrists and their relationship to the Christian Church having been previously stated, there follows now the more particular definition of the antichristian lie.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τίς ἐστιν ὁ ψεύστης</span>;] The interrogative form, with which John addresses his readers who know the truth, is explained by the vividness of the feeling with which the apostle is writing; similarly in chap. <a href="/1_john/5-5.htm" title="Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?">1 John 5:5</a>. He passes from the abstract (<span class="greekheb">πᾶν ψεῦδος</span>) directly to the concrete (<span class="greekheb">ψεύστης</span>). The definite article: <span class="greekheb">ὁ ψεύστης</span> (Luther incorrectly: <span class="ital">a</span> liar), brings out the idea in clearer distinctness: <span class="ital">the</span> liar <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐξοχήν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> he in whom the lie appears in concrete personality (so also Braune), identical with <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀντίχριστος</span>, which is denied by Jachmann through mistake of John’s idea. The thought is weakened by the supposition that the apostle is speaking here comparatively (Grotius: quis potest major esse impostor?). Nor is Bengel’s interpretation satisfactory: quis est <span class="ital">illius</span> mendacii imposturaeque reus? with which Düsterdieck agrees, when he paraphrases: “What sort of a lie I mean, ye know very well. Who are the liars? Are they not those who deny, etc.?” The apostle certainly has the particular lie of the antichrists of his time in view, but this he regards as the <span class="ital">one</span> chief and fundamental lie “in which all <span class="greekheb">ψεῦδος</span> is comprised” (Lücke). The explanation of Baumgarten-Crusius is plainly quite erroneous: “what else is a false doctrine than, etc.?” nor is that of Ebrard less so, as he finds in this <span class="ital">catechetical</span> (!) question intended for <span class="ital">children</span> this meaning: “on whose side is the lie?” with which he then supplies the corresponding question: “and on whose side is the truth?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀρνούμενος</span>] <span class="greekheb">εἰ μή</span>, often after a negation, may also stand after a question, as in this a negation is contained; comp. <a href="/luke/17-18.htm" title="There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.">Luke 17:18</a>; <a href="/romans/11-15.htm" title="For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?">Romans 11:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?">2 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-5.htm" title="Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?">1 John 5:5</a>; it corresponds to the German: “<span class="ital">als nur</span>” (English: “but only,” “except”), and limits the general thought to a particular one; the sense accordingly is: No other is the liar but he who, etc. According to Ebrard, <span class="greekheb">εἰ μή</span> must here only have the meaning of “than,” because the question here is, which <span class="ital">of the two dogmatical tendencies</span> (!) belongs to the lie; that the apostle here has in view <span class="ital">two</span> parties, namely, the antichrists and the believing Christians, and asks which of them is in possession of the truth, is a pure fiction, for which there is not the slightest evidence in the text. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι Ἰησοῦς οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ Χριστός</span>] On the construction of the negative idea <span class="greekheb">ἀρνεῖσθαι</span> with the following <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span>, by which the negation is more strongly emphasized, see Kühner, II. p. 410.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The lie of the Antichrist consists in the denial that Jesus is <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in the denial of the identity of Jesus and Christ, whereby is meant, according to <a href="/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1 John 2:19</a> and chap. <a href="/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>, not the Jewish unbelief, that Jesus is not the promised Messiah, but the Gnostic heresy of the <span class="ital">distinction between Jesus and Christ</span>, which forms the sharpest contradiction to the apostle’s doctrine that Jesus is the <span class="greekheb">λόγος σὰρξ γενόμενος</span>. It is erroneous to find here a reference to two different kinds of heresy; on the one hand the denial of the <span class="ital">divine</span>, on the other the denial of the <span class="ital">human</span>, nature of Jesus;[171] for John speaks only of <span class="ital">one</span> lie.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ ἀντίχριστος</span>] <span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span> refers back to <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀρνούμενος</span>: the liar who denies the identity of Jesus and Christ, he is the Antichrist. It is natural to take <span class="greekheb">ὁ ψεύστης</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀντιχρ</span>. here in general signification, and to find therein a justification for Bengel’s conception of John’s idea of Antichrist; but as the lie of the antichrists proceeds from the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου</span>, it may be ascribed to the Antichrist himself; the individual antichrists are the mouth by which he speaks.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀρνούμενος τὸν πατέρα καὶ τὸν υἱόν</span>] is not to be connected with <span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span>, so that the sense would be: this one, who denies the Father and the Son, is the Antichrist; but as a clause of more particular definition subordinate to <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀντίχριστος</span>. “John hereby adds a new element which states the full unhappy <span class="ital">consequence</span> of that Antichristian lie” (Düsterdieck; similarly Braune). The apostle wants to bring out here that the denial that Jesus is <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span> is in its very essence a denial of the <span class="ital">Father</span> and of the <span class="ital">Son.</span> He who denies the identity of Jesus and Christ, directly denies the Son, for the Son is no other than <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς ὁ Χριστός</span> (neither an Aeon named Christ that did not become man, nor Jesus who is not Christ, or, according to <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>, the Logos);[172] but he who denies the Son denies also the Father, and not merely inasmuch as Son and Father are logically interchangeable ideas, but because the nature of the Father is only manifested in the Son, and all true knowledge of the Father is conditioned by the knowledge of the Son, so that the God of those who deny the Son is not the true God, but a false image of their own thoughts—an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἼΔΩΛΟΝ</span></span></span>.[173]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[171] So Tertullian (<span class="ital">de Praescript.</span> c. 33): Joh. in ep. cos maxime antichristos vocat, qui Christum negarent in carne venisse et qui non putarent Jesum esse Filium Dei; illud Marcion, hoe Ebion vindicavit. Similarly Besser: “That Jesus was not the Christ, the Christ not Jesus. Either the <span class="ital">Word</span> that was from the beginning was separated from this Jesus, or the <span class="ital">flesh</span> was denied to the eternal Word.” Comp. Introd. sec. 3.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[172] Weiss correctly brings out the distinction between the ideas <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> and <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span>, when he observes that <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span> is a historical conception to the apostle, and that it is enough for him that that proposition of the false teachers denies the Messiahship of Christ, from which all belief in Him must take its starting-point, in order to arrive at the recognition that Jesus is the Son of God, and thus in the Son to recognise the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[173] That such commentators as proceed on rationalistic assumptions have not been able to interpret the thought of the apostle is quite natural. But even others have got a more or less indistinct view of it by putting, as Düsterdieck rightly says, “the ideas of John too directly into dogmatic forms (and, indeed, into those defined by the Church);” or by ignoring the realism of the apostle, and regarding what he considered in an objectively real way as a mere element of the subjective consideration; or, finally, by bringing out one-sided references instead of giving the ideas the due force of their entire comprehension.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ?

The exactly parallel construction in <a href="/context/1_john/5-4.htm" title="For whatever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith....">1 John 5:4-5</a> shews that ‘the liar’ here does not mean ‘the greatest liar possible’. Moreover, this would not be true. Is denying that Jesus is the Christ a greater lie than denying the existence of the Son, or of God?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The abruptness of the question is startling.

By this substitution, which is quite in S. John’s manner, he leads us on to see that to deny the one is to deny the other. Jesus is the Christ, and the Christ is the Son of God; therefore to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Son. And to deny the Son is to deny the Father; not merely because Son and Father are correlatives and mutually imply one another, but because the Son is the revelation of the Father, without whom the Father cannot be known. ‘Neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and <span class="ital">he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal Him</span>’ (<a href="/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a>). ‘No one cometh unto the Father <span class="ital">but by Me</span>’ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>).

In the Acts, Paul continually demonstrated this main point; and in his Epistles he presupposed it. John often makes mention of this main point in his Gospel, and in this and the following Epistle. From which it may be inferred that these books were not written by him altogether at the close of his life.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀντίχριστος</span>, <span class="ital">antichrist</span>) <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>. The truth respecting Jesus, that He is the Christ, that He is the Son of God and is come in the flesh, must be held in its integrity. He who denies one part respecting Jesus, does not hold both Him, in His completeness, and the Father at the same time. The spirit of antichrist, and antichrist has done and does this.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν Πατέρα καὶ τὸν Υἱὸν</span>, <span class="ital">the Father and the Son</span>) that is, the Son, and therefore the Father.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is the liar, but he that denieth,</span> etc.? From the lie St. John passes on to the utterer of it. "Ye readily distinguish any lie from the truth. Who, then, is the liar?" "The liar" does not mean the liar <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, as if this denial constituted the very acme of falsehood. To deny the very existence of God is surely a worse lie. Still less can we say that "the context leaves no doubt that 'the liar' is the same with 'the antichrist.'" The article <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, just as in <a href="/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4, 5</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>. The very form of sentence is the same: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> and there <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> cannot mean the victor, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, who is Christ, and not the believer.

"Who tells lies, if not he who denies (and says) that Jesus is not the Christ?" This was the great Gnostic lie to which St. John's Gospel and Epistle give the answer. The antichrist is this, he who denieth the Father and the Son. "The antichrist" here is not the great adversary, but one having similar characteristics. He denies the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus virtually denies both the Father and Son (comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>). This truth St. John proceeds to restate and develop. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A liar (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., correctly, "the liar." For a similar interrogative phrase see <a href="/1_john/5-5.htm">1 John 5:5</a>. It marks the lively feeling with which the apostle writes. By the definite article, the liar, the lie is set forth in its concrete personality: the one who impersonates all that is false, as antichrist represents every form of hostility and opposition to Christ. The denial that Jesus is the Christ is the representative falsehood. He that denies is the representative liar.<p>He that denieth (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>The article with the participle denotes the habitual denial. Lit., the one denying, the one who habitually represents this attitude towards Christ. The words are aimed at the heresy of Cerinthus, a man of Jewish decent and educated at Alexandria. He denied the miraculous conception of Jesus, and taught that, after His baptism, the Christ descended upon Him in the form of a dove, and that He then announced the unknown Father and wrought miracles; but that, towards the end of His ministry, the Christ departed again from Jesus, and Jesus suffered and rose from the dead, while the Christ remained impassible (incapable of suffering) as a spiritual being.<p>The Father<p>The title the Father occurs always in its simple form in the Epistle.
