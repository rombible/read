The world draws the heart from God; and the more the love of the world prevails, the more the love of God decays. The things of the world are classed according to the three ruling inclinations of depraved nature. 1. The lust of the flesh, of the body: wrong desires of the heart, the appetite of indulging all things that excite and inflame sensual pleasures. 2. The lust of the eyes: the eyes are delighted with riches and rich possessions; this is the lust of covetousness. 3. The pride of life: a vain man craves the grandeur and pomp of a vain-glorious life; this includes thirst after honour and applause. The things of the world quickly fade and die away; desire itself will ere long fail and cease, but holy affection is not like the lust that passes away. The love of God shall never fail. Many vain efforts have been made to evade the force of this passage by limitations, distinctions, or exceptions. Many have tried to show how far we may be carnally-minded, and love the world; but the plain meaning of these verses cannot easily be mistaken. Unless this victory over the world is begun in the heart, a man has no root in himself, but will fall away, or at most remain an unfruitful professor. Yet these vanities are so alluring to the corruption in our hearts, that without constant watching and prayer, we cannot escape the world, or obtain victory over the god and prince of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all that is in the world - That is, all that really constitutes the world, or that enters into the aims and purposes of those who live for this life. All that that community lives for may be comprised under the following things.<p>The lust of the flesh - The word "lust" is used here in the general sense of desire, or that which is the object of desire - not in the narrow sense in which it is now commonly used to denote libidinous passion. See the notes at <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>. The phrase, "the lust of the flesh," here denotes that which pampers the appetites, or all that is connected with the indulgence of the mere animal propensities. A large part of the world lives for little more than this. This is the lowest form of worldly indulgence; those which are immediately specified being of a higher order, though still merely worldly.<p>And the lust of the eyes - That which is designed merely to gratify the sight. This would include, of course, costly clothes, jewels, gorgeous furniture, splendid palaces, pleasure-grounds, etc. The object is to refer to the frivolous vanities of this world, the thing on which the eye delights to rest where there is no higher object of life. It does not, of course, mean that the eye is never to be gratified, or that we can find as much pleasure in an ugly as in a handsome object, or that it is sinful to find pleasure in beholding objects of real beauty - for the world, as formed by its Creator, is full of such things, and he could not but have intended that pleasure should enter the soul through the eye, or that the beauties which he has shed so lavishly over his works should contribute to the happiness of his creatures; but the apostle refers to this when it is the great and leading object of life - when it is sought without any connection with religion or reference to the world to come.<p>And the pride of life - The word here used means, properly, ostentation or boasting, and then arrogance or pride. - Robinson. It refers to whatever there is that tends to promote pride, or that is an index of pride, such as the ostentatious display of dress, equipage, furniture, etc.<p>Is not of the Father - Does not proceed from God, or meet with his approbation. It is not of the nature of true religion to seek these things, nor can their pursuit be reconciled with the existence of real piety in the heart. The sincere Christian has nobler ends; and he who has not any higher ends, and whose conduct and feelings can all be accounted for by a desire for these things, cannot be a true Christian.<p>But is of the world - Is originated solely by the objects and purposes of this life, where religion and the life to come are excluded. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. all that is in the world&#8212;can be classed under one or other of the three; the world contains these and no more.<p>lust of the flesh&#8212;that is, the lust which has its seat and source in our lower animal nature. Satan tried this temptation the first on Christ: Lu 4:3, "Command this stone that it be made bread." Youth is especially liable to fleshly lusts.<p>lust of the eyes&#8212;the avenue through which outward things of the world, riches, pomp, and beauty, inflame us. Satan tried this temptation on Christ when he showed Him the kingdoms of the world in a moment. By the lust of the eyes David (2Sa 11:2) and Achan fell (Jos 7:21). Compare David's prayer, Ps 119:37; Job's resolve, Ps 31:1; Mt 5:28. The only good of worldly riches to the possessor is the beholding them with the eyes. Compare Lu 14:18, "I must go and SEE it."<p>pride of life&#8212;literally, "arrogant assumption": vainglorious display. Pride was Satan's sin whereby he fell and forms the link between the two foes of man, the world (answering to "the lust of the eyes") and the devil (as "the lust of the flesh" is the third foe). Satan tried this temptation on Christ in setting Him on the temple pinnacle that, in spiritual pride and presumption, on the ground of His Father's care, He should cast Himself down. The same three foes appear in the three classes of soil on which the divine seed falls: the wayside hearers, the devil; the thorns, the world; the rocky undersoil, the flesh (Mt 13:18-23; Mr 4:3-8). The world's awful antitrinity, the "lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life," similarly is presented in Satan's temptation of Eve: "When she saw that the tree was good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise," Ge 3:6 (one manifestation of "the pride of life," the desire to know above what God has revealed, Col 2:8, the pride of unsanctified knowledge).<p>of&#8212;does not spring from "the Father" (used in relation to the preceding "little children," 1Jo 2:12, or "little sons"). He who is born of God alone turns to God; he who is of the world turns to the world; the sources of love to God and love to the world, are irreconcilably distinct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here he explains his meaning, what, under the name of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the world, </span> and <span class="ital">the things</span> of it, we are not to love, or under what notion we ought not to love it, viz. the world as it contains the objects and nutriment of these mentioned lusts; either more grossly sensual, called <span class="ital">the lust of the flesh, </span> viz. of gluttony, drunkenness, whoredom, &c. <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>,14</span>; or that which is excited more immediately by the fancy, unto which the eye especially ministereth, the excessive appetite of much wealth, and great possessions; which the eye is therefore said to desire, and not to be satisfied with, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm" title="I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts....">Ecclesiastes 2:8-10</a></span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm" title="There is one alone, and there is not a second; yes, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither said he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good?

This triple distribution some observe to have been before used by some of the ancient learned Jews, and imitated by certain of the more refilled heathens; whence, as being formerly known and understood, the apostle might be induced to make use of it.

This is the sum of the evil things in the world; or these following are the objects of sin in the world, or about which wicked men are conversant; even such as are carnal or grateful to the flesh, visible to the eye, and belong to this vain life, or serve to fill with pride and vanity; or these are the main things, which men that love the world most highly value and esteem: <p>the lust of the flesh; by which is meant, not lust in general, or concupiscence, the corruption of nature, which is the fountain of all sin, or indwelling sin, the flesh, or that corrupt principle which lusts against the Spirit; nor the various lusts of the flesh, fleshly lusts, which war against the soul, and which are many, and are also called worldly lusts; but some particular one, "a lust of the body", as the Syriac version reads; either the lust of uncleanness, which includes all unchaste desires, thoughts, words, and actions, fornication, adultery, rape, incest, sodomy, and all unnatural lusts; and which make up a considerable part of the all that is in the world: or else intemperance in eating and drinking, gluttony and drunkenness, excess of wine, surfeitings, rioting, and revellings, and all the sensual pleasures of life, by which the carnal mind, and the lusts of it, are gratified; whereby the soul is destroyed, the body is dishonoured, and a wound, dishonour, and reproach brought on the character, not to be removed; for which reasons the world, and the things of it, are not to be loved: the next follows, <p>the lust of the eyes: after unlawful objects, and may design unchaste and lascivious looks, eyes full of adultery, and whereby adultery is committed; see <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>; but then this falls in with the other, unless that be confined to intemperance; rather then this may intend a sinful curiosity of seeing vain sights, and shows, with which the eye of man is never satisfied, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>; and against which the psalmist prays, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>, or rather the sin of covetousness is here designed, the objects of which are visible things, as gold, silver, houses, lands, and possessions, with which riches the eyes of men are never satisfied, and which sin is drawn forth and cherished by the eyes; and indeed a covetous man has little more satisfaction than the beholding his substance with his eyes, and in which he takes much sinful pleasure; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>; and what a poor vain empty thing is this! therefore, love not the world, since this is a principal thing in it: as is also <p>the pride of life; by which seems to be meant, ambition of honour, of chief places and high titles, as in the Scribes and Pharisees, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a>, or of grand living, for the word signifies not so much life as living; living in a sumptuous, gay, luxurious, and pompous manner, in rich diet, costly apparel, having fine seats, palaces, and stately buildings, and numerous attendance; all which is but vanity and vexation of spirit; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1</a>. The Syriac and Arabic versions read, "the pride of the age"; and every age has some peculiar things in which the pride of it appears. Now neither of these <p>is of the Father; of God the Father, as the Ethiopic version reads; the things which are desired and lusted after are of God, but not the lust itself; God is not the author of sin, nor is it agreeable to his will: <p>but is of the world; of the men of it, and agreeable to their carnal minds; and is a reason why things of the world are not to be loved by the saints, who are not of it, but chosen and called out of it; and besides, all these things are mean, base, vile, and contemptible, and unworthy of their love and affection. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.">1 John 2:16</a>. Confirmation of the preceding thought that love to the world is inconsistent with love to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι πᾶν τὸ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span>] Bede incorrectly explains the neuter here (as it certainly does appear elsewhere in John) as masculine: omnes mundi dilectores non habent nisi concupiscentiam; most commentators regard the expression as identical with the foregoing <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span>; even Düsterdieck, who, in reference to the following <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθυμία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., thinks that a “change occurs from the representation of the objects of the love of the world to the subjective desire itself and its actual manifestations.” But even apart from the fact that the assumption of such a change in the form is only a makeshift, the expression of the apostle himself is opposed to this; for had he not meant by <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. something else than by <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τῷ κ</span>., he would have put the neuter plural here also. Besides, it must not be overlooked why the following: <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθυμία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. could not be the apposition stating the sense of <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. (Frommann, p. 269).[138] Accordingly, the apostle means by this expression: all that forms the contents, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the substance of the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>; its inner life, which animates it (Braune); in what this consists, the following words state. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῆς σαρκὸς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Although the ideas <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀλαζονεία</span> in themselves denote a subjective disposition of man, yet several commentators think that here not this, but the objective things are meant, to which that subjective disposition is directed (Bengel, Russmeyer, Lange, Ewald), or that the otherwise subjective idea disappears into the objective (de Wette), or at least that both the subjective and the objective are to be thought of together (Lorinus, Brückner). But with the correct conception of the ideas <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> and <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span> there is no apparent reason for such an arbitrary explanation, by which violence is done to the words of the apostle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῆς σαρκός</span>] The genitive is here not the genitive of the object, but, as is the case with <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>[139] always in the N.

Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2 Peter 2:10</a> : “the desire which occurs in the sphere of the flesh;” the apostle scarcely conceived the idea so indefinitely. The idea may be taken in a broader or in a narrower sense; the first view in Lücke (“fleshly, sensuous desire in general, in contrast to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΙ ΠΕΡΙΠΑΤΕῖΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>; comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1 Peter 2:11</a>”), de Wette, Neander, Düsterdieck; in the second, the desire of sensuality and drunkenness is specially understood; Augustine: desiderium earum rerum, quae pertinent ad carnem, sicut cibus et concubitus et caetera hujusmodi; similarly Grotius, Baumgarten-Crusius, Sander, Besser, etc.; Brückner limits the idea to “the lust of the flesh in the narrower sense;” Gerlach specially to every sort of pursuit of <span class="ital">enjoyment;</span>[140] and Ebrard to “<span class="ital">sexual</span> enjoyments.”[141] The right explanation can be found only on the consideration of the following expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> “<span class="ital">the desire that is inherent in the eyes, that is peculiar to them;</span>” the expression is explained in this way, that the desire of seeing something is attributed to the sense of sight itself.[142] This idea also is understood in a broader and in a narrower sense. As Lücke calls the eyes “as it were the principal gates of sensual desire for the external world,” he identifies this idea with the preceding one; de Wette does the same, interpreting it (in objective aspect): “what the eyes see, and by what <span class="ital">sensual desire</span> is excited.” The connection by <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, however, which is further followed by a second <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, shows that the two ideas are to be definitely distinguished. Accordingly, most commentators justly regard <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν</span> as the description of a special sort of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>; thus (against de Wette) Brückner in subjective and objective view: “<span class="ital">the lust of the eyes</span>, and, at the same time, that in which, as sensuous and earthly, the eyes delight.” Two different interpretations are found with a more exact definition. Very many commentators, as Luther, Socinus, Grotius, Hornejus, Estius, Lorinus, Wolf, Clarius, Paulus, Semler, Baumgarten-Crusius, Gerlach, etc.,[143] hold, though with some modifications, the expression to be substantially synonymous with <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span>, avaritia. On behalf of this interpretation, appeal is made principally to several passages of the O. T., and especially to <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm" title="There is one alone, and there is not a second; yes, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither said he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yes, it is a sore travail.">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm" title="He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance with increase: this is also vanity.">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>, <a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm" title="Will you set your eyes on that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.">Proverbs 23:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm" title="Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.">Proverbs 27:20</a>; but erroneously, for even though the eye of the covetous or avaricious man looks with pleasure on his treasures, and eagerly looks out for new ones, still the possession or acquirement of wealth is to him the chief thing; the striving for it, however, is not expressed by the phrase: <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν</span>. Still less justifiable is the explanation of Ebrard, who partly agrees with those commentators, but regards the idea of “avarice” as too narrow; and, with an appeal to passages such as <a href="/psalms/17-11.htm" title="They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;">Psalm 17:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/54-6.htm" title="I will freely sacrifice to you: I will praise your name, O LORD; for it is good.">Psalm 54:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-8.htm" title="Only with your eyes shall you behold and see the reward of the wicked.">Psalm 91:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm" title="The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.">Psalm 92:12</a> <a href="/proverbs/6-17.htm" title="A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,">Proverbs 6:17</a>, etc., maintains that by <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀφθ</span>. is meant “the whole sphere of the desires of selfishness, envy, and avarice, of hatred and revenge (!).” Other commentators, on the contrary, retain the reference to the pleasure of mere sight, but limit this too much to dramatic performances, etc.; thus Augustine: omnis curiositas in spectaculis, in theatris; similarly Neander and others. Such a limitation, however, is arbitrary; accordingly, others refer the expression to other objects of sight, thus Calvin: tam libidinosos conspectus comprehendit, quam vanitatem, quae in pompis et inani splendore vagatur; but it is more correct to take the reference to these things in a quite general way, and, with Spener, to interpret: “all sinful desire by which we seek delight in the seeing itself” (so also Braune); besides, it is to be observed that <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθυμία τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀφθ</span>. is not the desire for wealth, etc., which is excited by the sight (Rickli and others[144]), but the desire of seeing unseemly things, and the sinful pleasure which the sight of them affords.[145] Thus, this idea is quite exclusive of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία τῆς σαρκός</span>; if the latter is taken quite generally, then the lust of the eyes is a particular species of it, which the apostle specially mentions in order to meet the idea that the desire of seeing anything can have nothing sinful in it. But, having regard to the simple juxtaposition of the ideas by <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, it is more correct to suppose that John conceived the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς σαρκός</span> not in that general sense, but in the particular sense of the “lust for wealth and immoderate enjoyment,” so that the two ideas stand to one another in the relation not of subordination, but of co-ordination, both being subordinate to the general idea of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ ἀλαζονεία τοῦ βίου</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἀλαζονεία</span> is usually translated by superbia, ambitio (Socinus: ambitio in honoribus quaerendis ac sectandis), and by similar words, and thereby is understood <span class="ital">ambition</span>, together with the pride and haughty contempt for others which are frequently associated with it;[146] thus Cyril interprets (<span class="ital">Homil. Pasch.</span> xxvii.): <span class="greekheb">ἀλαζονείαν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">β</span>. <span class="greekheb">φησὶ τῶν ἀξιωμάτων ὑπεροχὴν καὶ τὸ ἠρμένον ὕψος κατά γε τιμὴν καὶ δόξαν</span>. Thereby, however, its peculiar meaning is not assigned to the word. In the N. T. <span class="greekheb">ἀλαζονεία</span> only appears in <a href="/james/4-16.htm" title="But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.">Jam 4:16</a> (in the plural); the adjective <span class="greekheb">ἀλάζων</span> in <a href="/romans/1-30.htm" title="Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,">Romans 1:30</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2 Timothy 3:2</a>, in close connection with <span class="greekheb">ὑπερήφανος</span>, from which, however, it does not follow that the idea of ambition, thirst for glory, etc., is contained in it, but only that the <span class="greekheb">ἀλαζ</span>. is related to <span class="greekheb">ὑπερηφανία</span>; in James is meant thereby—according to the context—the <span class="ital">haughtiness which overlooks the uncertainty of earthly happiness, and ostentatiously relies on its permanence.</span> In the same sense = <span class="ital">ostentatious pride in the possession</span>, whether real or pretended, <span class="ital">of earthly good things</span>, such as happiness, power, knowledge, etc., the word appears also in the Apocrypha of the O.

In classical Greek <span class="greekheb">ἀλαζονεία</span> has almost always the collateral meaning of the unreality of proud ostentation (Theophr. <span class="ital">Charact.</span> 23: <span class="greekheb">προσποίησίς τις ἀγαθῶν οὐκ ὄντων πρὸς δόξαν</span>; Plato, <span class="ital">Phaedr.:</span> <span class="greekheb">ἕξις προσποιητικὴ ἀγαθοῦ ἢ ἀγαθῶν τῶν μὴ ὑπαρχόντων</span>; antithesis of <span class="greekheb">εἰρωνεία</span>), which has obtained in Hellenistic usage only in so far that the idea here also always refers to something by its very nature worthless and trifling, and in this way certainly includes a delusion or unreality. This meaning is to be retained here also, as is rightly done by Lücke, Sander, Besser, Braune;[147] for examples in the Scriptures, comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1 Chronicles 22:1</a> ff.; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm" title="I said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove you with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.">Ecclesiastes 2:1</a> ff.; <a href="/context/ezekiel/28-16.htm" title="By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the middle of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire....">Ezekiel 28:16-17</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-27.htm" title="Why, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility.">Daniel 4:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm" title="And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:">Revelation 17:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-7.htm" title="How much she has glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she said in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.">Revelation 18:7</a>, etc. The genitive <span class="greekheb">τοῦ βίου</span> serves for the more particular definition of the idea; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΊΟς</span></span></span> signifies in the N.

To say that these did not originate from God would be to contradict the Apostle himself (<a href="/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a>) and to affirm those Gnostic doctrines against which he is contending. The Gnostics, believing everything material to be radically evil, maintained that the universe was created, not by God, but by the evil one, or at least by an inferior deity. By ‘all that is in the world’ is meant the spirit which animates it, its tendencies and tone. These, which are utterly opposed to God, did not originate in Him, but in the free and rebellious wills of His creatures, seduced by ‘the ruler of this world’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the lust of the flesh</span>] This does not mean the lust <span class="ital">for</span> the flesh, any more than ‘the lust of the eyes’ means the lust <span class="ital">for</span> the eyes. In both cases the genitive is not objective but subjective, as is generally the case with genitives after ‘lust’ (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>) in N. T. Comp. <a href="/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.">Galatians 5:16</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>.

John does not say ‘the lust of the <span class="ital">body</span>.’ ‘The body’ in N.T. is perhaps never used to denote the innately corrupt portion of man’s nature: for that the common term is ‘the flesh.’ ‘The body’ is that neutral portion which may become either good or bad. It may be sanctified as the abode and instrument of the Spirit, or degraded under the tyranny of the flesh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the lust of the eyes</span>] The desire of seeing unlawful sights for the sake of the sinful pleasure to be derived from the sight; idle and prurient curiosity. Familiar as S. John’s readers must have been with the foul and cruel exhibitions of the circus and amphitheatre, this statement would at once meet with their assent. Tertullian, though he does not quote this passage in his treatise <span class="ital">De Spectaculis</span>, is full of its spirit: “The source from which all circus games are taken pollutes them … What is tainted taints us” (VII., VIII.). Similarly S. Augustine on this passage; “This it is that works in spectacles, in theatres, in sacraments of the devil, in magical arts, in witchcraft; none other than curiosity.” See also <span class="ital">Confessions</span> VI. vii., viii., X. xxxv. 55.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the pride of life</span>] Or, as R. V., <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="bld">vainglory</span> <span class="ital">of life</span>. Latin writers vary much in their renderings: <span class="ital">superbia vitae; ambilio saeculi; jactantia hujus vitae; jactantia vitae humanae</span>. The word (<span class="greekheb">ἀλαζονεία</span>) occurs elsewhere only <a href="/james/4-16.htm" title="But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.">James 4:16</a>, and there in the plural; where A. V. has ‘boastings’ and R. V. ‘vauntings.’ The cognate adjective (<span class="greekheb">ἀλάζων</span>) occurs <a href="/romans/1-30.htm" title="Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,">Romans 1:30</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2 Timothy 3:2</a>, where A. V. has ‘boasters’ and R. V. ‘boastful’. Pretentious ostentation, as of a wandering mountebank, is the radical signification of the word. In classical Greek the pretentiousness is the predominant notion; in Hellenistic Greek, the ostentation. Compare the account of this vice in Aristotle (<span class="ital">Nic. Eth.</span> IV. vii.) with <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-8.htm" title="What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us?">Wis 5:8</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-8.htm" title="And thus he that a little afore thought he might command the waves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man) and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the ground, and carried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the manifest power of God.">2Ma 9:8</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-6.htm" title="So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined to set up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and them that were with him.">2Ma 15:6</a>. Ostentatious pride in the things which one possesses is the signification of the term here; ‘life’ meaning ‘means of life, goods, possessions’. The word for ‘life’ (<span class="greekheb">βίος</span>) is altogether different from that used in <a href="/context/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;...">1 John 1:1-2</a> and elsewhere in the Epistle (<span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>). This word (<span class="greekheb">βίος</span>) occurs again <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>, and elsewhere in N.T. only 8 times, chiefly in S. Luke. The other word occurs 13 times in this Epistle, and elsewhere in N. T. over 100 times. This is what we might expect. The word used here means (1) <span class="ital">period of human life</span>, as <a href="/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.">1 Timothy 2:2</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-4.htm" title="No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier.">2 Timothy 2:4</a>; (2) <span class="ital">means of life</span>, as here, <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>, <a href="/mark/12-44.htm" title="For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.">Mark 12:44</a>; <a href="/luke/8-14.htm" title="And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.">Luke 8:14</a>; <a href="/luke/8-43.htm" title="And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living on physicians, neither could be healed of any,">Luke 8:43</a>; <a href="/luke/15-12.htm" title="And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me. And he divided to them his living.">Luke 15:12</a>; <a href="/luke/15-30.htm" title="But as soon as this your son was come, which has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf.">Luke 15:30</a>; <a href="/luke/21-4.htm" title="For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God: but she of her penury has cast in all the living that she had.">Luke 21:4</a> (in <a href="/1_peter/4-3.htm" title="For the time past of our life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, parties, and abominable idolatries:">1 Peter 4:3</a> the word is not genuine). With the duration of mortal life and the means of prolonging it the Gospel has comparatively little to do. It is concerned rather with that spiritual life which is not measured by time (<a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>), and which is independent of material wealth and food. For this the other word (<span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>) is invariably used. By ‘the vainglory of life’ then is meant <span class="ital">ostentatious pride in the possession of worldly resources</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These three evil elements or tendencies ‘in the world’ are co-ordinate: no one of them includes the other two. The first two are wrongful desires of what is not possessed; the third is a wrongful behaviour with regard to what is possessed. The first two may be the vices of a solitary; the third requires society. We can have sinful desires when we are alone, but we cannot be ostentatious without company.

S. John says ‘the Father’ rather than ‘God’ to emphasize the idea of parentage. Its origin is from the world and its ruler, the devil. Comp. ‘Ye are of (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>) your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will to do’ (<a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>). The phrase ‘to be of’ is highly characteristic of S. John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A. The Three Evil Tendencies in the World<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The three forms of evil ‘in the world’ mentioned in <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.">1 John 2:16</a> have been taken as a summary of sin, if not in all its aspects, at least in its chief aspects. ‘The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life’ have seemed from very early times to form a synopsis of the various modes of temptation and sin. And certainly they cover so wide a field that we cannot well suppose that they are mere examples of evil more or less fortuitously mentioned. They appear to have been carefully chosen on account of their typical nature and wide comprehensiveness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is, however, a wide difference between the views stated at the beginning and end of the preceding paragraph. It is one thing to say that we have here a very comprehensive statement of three typical forms of evil; quite another to say that the statement is a summary of all the various kinds of temptation and sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To begin with, we must bear in mind what seems to be S. John’s purpose in this statement. He is not giving us an account of the different ways in which Christians are tempted, or (what is much the same) the different sins into which they may fall. Rather, he is stating the principal forms of evil which are exhibited ‘in the world,’ i.e. in those who are <span class="ital">not</span> Christians. He is insisting upon the evil origin of these desires and tendencies, and of the world in which they exist, in order that his readers may know that the world and its ways have no claim on their affections. All that is of God, and especially each child of God, has a claim on the love of every believer. All that is not of God has no such claim.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is difficult to maintain, without making some of the three heads unnaturally elastic, that all kinds of sin, or even all of the principal kinds of sin, are included in the list. Under which of the three heads are we to place unbelief, heresy, blasphemy, or persistent impenitence? Injustice in many of its forms, and especially in the most extreme form of all—murder, cannot without some violence be brought within the sweep of these three classes of evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two positions, therefore, may be insisted upon with regard to this classification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. It applies to forms of evil which prevail in the non-Christian world rather than to forms of temptation which beset Christians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It is very comprehensive, but it is not exhaustive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It seems well, however, to quote a powerful statement of what may be said on the other side. The italics are ours, to mark where there seems to be over-statement. “I think these distinctions, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, prove themselves to be very accurate and very complete distinctions in practice, though an ordinary philosopher may perhaps adopt some other classification of those tendencies which connect us with the world and give it a dominion over us. To the lust of the flesh may be referred <span class="ital">the crimes and miseries which have been produced by</span> gluttony, drunkenness, and the irregular intercourse of the sexes; an appalling catalogue, certainly, which no mortal eye could dare to gaze upon. To the lust of the eye may be referred all worship of visible things, <span class="ital">with the divisions, persecutions, hatreds, superstitions, which this worship has produced in different countries and ages</span>. To the pride or boasting of life,—where you are not to understand by life, for the Greek words are entirely different, either natural or spiritual life, such as the Apostle spoke of in the first chapter of the Epistle, but all that belongs to the outside of existence, houses, lands, whatever exalts a man above his fellow,—to this head we must refer <span class="ital">the oppressor’s wrongs</span>, and that contumely which Hamlet reckons among the things which are harder to bear even than the ‘slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.’ In these three divisions I suspect all the mischiefs which have befallen our race may be reckoned, and each of us is taught by the Apostle, and may know by experience that the seeds of the evils so enumerated are in himself” (Maurice).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Do we not feel in reading this that S. John’s words have been somewhat strained in order to make them cover the whole ground? One sin produces so many others in its train, and these again so many more, that there will not be much difficulty in making the classification exhaustive, if under each head we are to include all the crimes and miseries, divisions and hatreds, which that particular form of evil has <span class="ital">produced</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some of the <span class="ital">parallels</span> and <span class="ital">contrasts</span> which have from early times been made to the Apostle’s classification are striking, even when somewhat fanciful. Others are both fanciful and unreal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The three forms of evil noticed by S. John in this passage are only partially parallel to those which are commonly represented under the three heads of the world, the flesh, and the devil. Strictly speaking those particular forms of spiritual evil which would come under the head of the devil, as distinct from the world and the flesh, are not included in the Apostle’s enumeration at all. ‘The vainglory of life’ would come under the head of the world; ‘the lust of the flesh’ of course under that of ‘the flesh;’ while ‘the lust of the eyes’ would belong partly to the one and partly to the other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is more reality in the parallel drawn between S. John’s classification and the three elements in the temptation by which Eve was overcome by the evil one, and again the three temptations in which Christ overcame the evil one. ‘When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (the lust of the flesh), and that it was pleasant to the eyes (the lust of the eyes), and a tree to be desired to make one wise (the vainglory of life), she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat’ (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm" title="And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her; and he did eat.">Genesis 3:6</a>). Similarly, the temptations (1) to work a miracle in order to satisfy the cravings of the flesh, (2) to submit to Satan in order to win possession of all that the eye could see, (3) to tempt God in order to win the glory of a miraculous preservation (<a href="/context/luke/4-1.htm" title="And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,...">Luke 4:1-12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, there is point in the contrast drawn between these three forms of evil ‘in the world’ and the three great virtues which have been the peculiar creation of the Gospel (Liddon <span class="ital">Bampton Lectures</span> VIII. iii. B), purity, charity, and humility, with the three corresponding ‘counsels of perfection,’ chastity, poverty, and obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But in all these cases, whether of parallel or contrast, it will probably be felt that the correspondence is not perfect throughout, and that the comparison, though striking, is not quite satisfying, because not quite exact.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is surely both fanciful and misleading to see in this trinity of evil any contrast to the three Divine Persons in the Godhead. Is there any sense in which we can say with truth that a lust, whether of the flesh or of the eyes, is more opposed to the attributes of the Father than to the attributes of the Son? Forced analogies in any sphere are productive of fallacies; in the sphere of religious truth they may easily become profane.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.">1 John 2:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πᾶν</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῆς σαρκὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ ἀλαζονεία τοῦ βίου</span>, <span class="ital">all</span>—<span class="ital">the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life</span>) The world contains <span class="ital">all</span> these, and nothing besides them. <span class="ital">The lust of the flesh</span> means those things, on which the senses of enjoyment, as they are termed, viz. the taste and touch, feed. <span class="ital">The lust of the eyes</span> means those things, by which the senses of investigation, <span class="ital">the eye</span> or sight, hearing and smelling, are occupied. <span class="greekheb">Ἀλαζονεία</span> is <span class="ital">arrogant pomp</span>, when any one assumes too much to himself either in words or in actions.

Chrysostom, in the passage referred to above, speaks of <span class="greekheb">τὸν τύφον τὸν βιωτικὸν</span>, <span class="ital">the vanity of life</span>, and <span class="greekheb">τὴν φαντασίαν τοῦ βίου</span>, <span class="ital">the display of life</span>: where he relates a youthful example of such insolence overcome by sacred love. Either kind of <span class="ital">lust</span> is the little fire (spark); <span class="ital">arrogance</span> is the conflagration.

The second is included in the third, and the first in the second. The three cardinal vices, pleasure, avarice, and pride, do not coincide with these three; but yet they are comprised in them.
