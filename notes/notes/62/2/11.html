And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he that hateth his brother - The word here used would, in this connection, include both the mere absence of love, and positive hatred.

He wanders about not knowing what direction he shall take, or where the course which he is on will lead. The general meaning is, that he is ignorant of the whole nature of religion; or, in other words, love to the brethren is a central virtue in religion, and when a man has not that, his mind is entirely clouded on the whole subject, and he shows that he knows nothing of its nature. There is no virtue that is designed to be made more prominent in Christianity; and there is none that will throw its influence farther over a man's life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. is in darkness &#8230; walketh&#8212;"is" marks his continuing STATE: he has never come out of "the darkness" (so Greek); "walketh" marks his OUTWARD WALK and acts.<p>whither&#8212;Greek, "where"; including not only the destination to which, but the way whereby.<p>hath blinded&#8212;rather, as Greek aorist, "blinded" of old.

And he speaks suitably to the condition and state of each, such things as whereby he might most effectually insinuate with them, and oblige them deeply to consider what he had to say; doubling also his application to each of them, out of the earnestness of his intention and endeavour to fasten the exhortation upon them which was to follow. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But he that hateth his brother is in darkness,....

Perhaps both rest and motion are included; ‘knoweth not where he is and whither he is going’: i.e. neither knows his sin nor the direction in which his sin leads him. It is perhaps a little too definite to explain with S. Cyprian (<span class="ital">On Jealousy and Envy</span>, XI.), “for he is going without knowing it to Gehenna; in ignorance and blindness he is hurrying to punishment.” Comp. <a href="/john/12-35.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you.

It is literally ‘blinded’, not ‘hath blinded’, of what took place once for all some time ago: but this is just one of those cases where it is the Greek idiom to use the aorist, but the English idiom to use the perfect; and therefore the Greek aorist should be rendered by the English perfect. ‘Blinded’ must not be weakened into ‘dimmed’: the verb means definitely ‘to make blind’ (<a href="/john/12-40.htm" title="He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.">John 12:40</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). Animals kept in the dark, e.g. ponies in coal-mines, become blind: the organ that is never exercised loses its power. So also the conscience that is constantly ignored at last ceases to act. The source of the metaphor is perhaps <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm" title="Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.">Isaiah 6:10</a> : comp. <a href="/romans/11-10.htm" title="Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.">Romans 11:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Before proceeding further let us briefly sum up the Apostle’s line of argument thus far. ‘God is light. Christ is that light revealed. The life of Christ was a life of obedience and a life of love. In order, therefore, to have fellowship through Him with God believers must obey and love. The state of things in which this is possible has already begun. Therefore I write to you a command which is both old and new; walk in the light by imitating the love of Christ.’ In this manner he lays the foundations of Christian Ethics. The last three verses (9–11) shew that the special aspect of walking in light which is referred to in the commandment which is at once old and new is <span class="ital">love:</span> and if this be so, we can hardly doubt that in calling it ‘a new commandment’ he has in his mind Christ’s farewell words, <a href="/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>; ‘A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.’ The latter half of the verse is, therefore, the special interpretation of ‘ought himself also to walk even as He walked’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not easy to determine whether the division which follows (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake....">1 John 2:12-28</a></span>) is best regarded as a subdivision of the first main portion of the Epistle, or as a co-ordinate portion. In favour of the latter view are these facts: 1. The idea of <span class="ital">light</span> which runs through the whole of the division just concluded (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a> to <a href="/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a>), and which is mentioned six times in it, now disappears altogether. 2. The Epistle now takes a distinctly hortatory turn. The first part lays down principles: this part gives warnings and exhortations. 3. The Apostle seems to make a fresh start: <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake....">1 John 2:12-14</a></span> read like a new Introduction. In favour of making this part a subdivision of the first main division it may be urged:—1. Though the idea of light is no longer mentioned, yet other ideas to which it directly led, love, the truth, abiding in God, still continue: the parts evidently overlap. 2. The hortatory turn is only a partial change of form occurring merely in <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1 John 2:15</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a></span>. In the intermediate verses the aphoristic mode of expression continues. 3. The quasi-Introduction in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake....">1 John 2:12-14</a></span> no more constitutes a fresh division than the similar addresses in <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the whole it seems best to consider what follows as a subordinate part of the first main division of the Epistle. Thus far we have had the Condition and Conduct of the Believer considered on its <span class="ital">positive side</span>. We now have the <span class="ital">negative side</span>—What Walking in the Light excludes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ δὲ μισῶν</span>, <span class="ital">but he who hates</span>) A direct opposition.

Note also the climax effected by the gradual increase of predicates: in verse 9 one, in verse 10 two, in verse 11 three. The brother-hater has darkness as his habitual condition and as the atmosphere in which he lives and works; and long ago (aorist) the continual darkness deprived him of the very power of sight, so that he is in ignorance as to the course he is taking. Cf. "They know not, neither will they understand; <span class="accented">they walk on in darkness"</span> (<a href="/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>); "The fool <span class="accented">walketh in darkness"</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a>). "St. John scouts all the pretences of men to illumination which do not involve the practical acknowledgment of brotherhood. A man may say he is in the light as much as he pleases; but to be in the light implies that he is able to see his brethren, and not to stumble against them" (Maurice). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Is - walketh - whither<p>The condition of him who hates is viewed as related to being, action, and tendency.<p>He goeth (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Or, is going.
