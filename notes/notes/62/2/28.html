What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And now, little children - See the notes at <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>.<p>Abide in him; that, when he shall appear - In the end of the world, to receive his people to himself.

The apostle having finished his separate instructions exhortations to the fathers, young men and children, returns to the whole body of the saints in general, whom he addresses, as in 1Jo_2:1; under the name of little children; See Gill on <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; and whom he exhorts to abide in Christ, that is, in the exercise of faith on him, of hope in him, and love to him; and to hold to him the head, and to hold fast his word and Gospel, and abide by his truth and ordinances, and adhere to his cause and interest, and not to be moved away on any consideration; to which the following encouragement is given: <p>that when he shall appear; that is, Christ, who is now hid, and out of the sight of bodily eyes, is in heaven, at the right hand of God; but ere long he will appear a second time, and not only to those that look for him, but even every eye shall see him; and his appearance will be a glorious one, and his saints shall appear in glory with him, and shall be like him, and see him as he is: <p>we may have confidence; boldness or freedom, as now at the throne of grace, so then at the throne of judgment; where the saints will stand with courage and intrepidity, when the wicked will flee to the rocks and mountains, being filled with amazement, terror, and trembling: <p>and not be ashamed before him at his coming; they will not be put to shame by him; nor will they be ashamed of their confidence, faith, hope, and expectation; their hope will not make them ashamed, for they will now enjoy what they hoped for; and, notwithstanding all their sins and infirmities, they will not be ashamed, for they will have on the wedding garment, the righteousness of Christ, and will stand before the throne without fault, spot, or blemish; nor will Christ be ashamed of them who have not been ashamed of him and his words, but have confessed him, and have been faithful unto death, and have cleaved to him and his cause with full purpose of heart to the end. Some think ministers of the Gospel are here meant, who, when those that are under their care abide faithful, and persevere to the end, will give up their account with joy; and will have what they have expressed confidence in, and will have their expectations answered, and not disappointed, by having such souls as their joy and crown of rejoicing. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{26}</span> And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</span><p>(26) The conclusion both of the whole exhortation, and also of the former treatise.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a> concludes the section beginning at <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>, but serves at the same time as an introduction to the following section.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν</span>] cannot, it is true, be explained, with Paulus, by “even now already,” but neither can it be explained, with most of the commentators, exactly by igitur, or a similar word; here it rather introduces, as it frequently does, the following exhortation as a deduction from the present circumstances.

The ‘when’ (<span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span>) of A.V. (KL) must certainly give place to ‘if’ (<span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span>), which is more difficult and has overwhelming support (<span class="greekheb">א</span>ABC). ‘If’ <span class="ital">seems</span> to imply a doubt as to Christ’s return, and the change to ‘when’ has probably been made to avoid this. But ‘if’ implies no doubt as to the <span class="ital">fact</span>, it merely implies indifference as to the <span class="ital">time</span>: ‘if He should return in our day’ (see on <a href="/john/6-62.htm" title="What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?">John 6:62</a>; <a href="/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>; <a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>). <span class="bld">Be manifested</span> is greatly superior to ‘appear’ (as Augustine’s <span class="ital">manifestatus fuerit</span> is superior to the Vulgate’s <span class="ital">apparuerit</span>) because (1) the Greek verb is passive; (2) it is a favourite word (<span class="greekheb">φανεροῦν</span>) with S.

S. John alone uses the word in this last sense, for which other N.T. writers have ‘to be revealed’ (<span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύπτεσθαι</span>), a verb never used by S. John excepting once (<a href="/john/12-38.htm" title="That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?">John 12:38</a>) in a quotation from O.T.

I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1</a>), where he is under the influence of the LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we may have confidence</span>] The R. V. <span class="ital">has we may have</span> <span class="bld">boldness</span>. At first sight this looks like one of those small changes which have been somewhat hastily condemned as ‘vexatious, teasing, and irritating’. The A. V. wavers between ‘boldness’ (<a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>; <a href="/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="/acts/4-29.htm" title="And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant to your servants, that with all boldness they may speak your word,">Acts 4:29</a>; <a href="/acts/4-31.htm" title="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.">Acts 4:31</a>, &c.) and ‘confidence’, with occasionally ‘boldly’ (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>) instead of ‘with boldness’. The R. V. consistently has ‘boldness’ in all these places. The Greek word (<span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span>) means literally ‘freedom in <span class="ital">speaking</span>, readiness to <span class="ital">say anything</span>, frankness, intrepidity’. In this Epistle and that to the Hebrews it means especially the fearless trust with which the faithful soul meets God: <a href="/1_john/3-21.htm" title="Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.">1 John 3:21</a>, <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1 John 5:14</a>. Comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not be ashamed before him</span>] This cannot well be improved, but it is very inadequate: the Greek is ‘be ashamed <span class="ital">from</span> Him’, or ‘be shamed <span class="ital">away from</span> Him’; strikingly indicating the averted face and shrinking form which are the results of the shame. ‘Turn with shame’ or ‘shrink with shame from Him’ have been suggested as renderings. Similarly, in <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>, ‘Be not afraid of them is literally ‘Do not shrink away in text <span class="ital">from</span> them’. The interpretation ‘receive shame from Him’ is probably not right. Comp. the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/1-29.htm" title="For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm" title="Why gad you about so much to change your way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.">Jeremiah 2:36</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-13.htm" title="They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.">Jeremiah 12:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">at his coming</span>] The Greek word (<span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span> = presence) occurs nowhere else in S. John’s writings. In N. T. it amounts almost to a technical term to express Christ’s return to judgment (<a href="/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm" title="For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-37.htm" title="But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:37</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-39.htm" title="And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:39</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?

S. John uses it, as he uses ‘the Word’ and ‘the evil one’, without explanation, confident that his readers understand it. This is one of many small indications that he writes to well-instructed believers, not to children or the recently converted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>S. John’s divisions are seldom made with a broad line across the text (see on <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm" title="And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.">1 John 3:24</a>). The parts dovetail into one another and intermingle in a way that at times looks like confusion.

If we place the line between <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him....">1 John 2:27-28</a></span> we have the idea of <span class="ital">abiding in Christ</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning.

It appears, therefore, that he wrote this Epistle before the Apocalypse, in which at length His coming is represented as put off to a greater distance. Tertullian supposes that the Epistle was subsequently written.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[7] The word <span class="greekheb">μου</span>, which was set down by the margin of both Editions among the readings not to be approved of, by some chance or other has crept into the Germ.

The idea of free, open speech lies at the bottom of the word: coming before God's bar with nothing to conceal. The thought is embodied in the general confession of the Book of Common Prayer: "That we should not dissemble nor cloke them before the face of Almighty God our Heavenly Father, but confess them." So John Wesley's Hymn:<p>"Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness<p>My beauty are, my glorious dress:<p>'Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,<p>With joy shall I lift up my head.<p>Bold shall I stand in Thy great day,<p>For who aught to my charge shall lay?<p>Fully absolved through these I am, - <p>From sin and fear, from guilt and shame."<p>continued...</body></html>
