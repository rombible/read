Surely we should love those whom God has loved, and so loved. The Holy Spirit, grieved at selfishness, will leave the selfish heart without comfort, and full of darkness and terror. By what can it be known that a man has a true sense of the love of Christ for perishing sinners, or that the love of God has been planted in his heart by the Holy Spirit, if the love of the world and its good overcomes the feelings of compassion to a perishing brother? Every instance of this selfishness must weaken the evidences of a man's conversion; when habitual and allowed, it must decide against him. If conscience condemn us in known sin, or the neglect of known duty, God does so too. Let conscience therefore be well-informed, be heard, and diligently attended to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not - If we so live as to have an approving conscience - that is, if we indulge in no secret sin; if we discharge faithfully every known duty; if we submit without complaining to all the allotments of Divine Providence.<p>Then have we confidence toward God - Compare the <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm">1 John 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a> notes; <a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a> note. The apostle evidently does not mean that we have confidence toward God on the ground of what we do, as if it were meritorious, or as if it constituted a claim to his favor; but that we may so live as to have evidence of personal piety, and that we may look forward with a confident hope that we shall be accepted of him in the great day. The word here rendered "confidence" - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  parre&#772;sian - means properly "boldness;" usually boldness or openness in speaking our sentiments. See the notes at <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>. The confidence or boldness which we have toward our Maker is founded solely on the evidence that he will graciously accept us as pardoned sinners; not in the belief that we deserve his favor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Beloved&#8212;There is no "But" contrasting the two cases, 1Jo 3:20, 21, because "Beloved" sufficiently marks the transition to the case of the brethren walking in the full confidence of love (1Jo 3:18). The two results of our being able to "assure our hearts before Him" (1Jo 3:19), and of "our heart condemning us not" (of insincerity as to the truth in general, and as to LOVE in particular) are, (1) confidence toward God; (2) a sure answer to our prayers. John does not mean that all whose hearts do not condemn them, are therefore safe before God; for some have their conscience seared, others are ignorant of the truth, and it is not only sincerity, but sincerity in the truth which can save men. Christians are those meant here: knowing Christ's precepts and testing themselves by them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But for their not condemning us, though the expression be merely negative, it must imply somewhat positive; for there are many whose hearts condemn them not, through ignorance of their rule, or oscitancy, self-indulgence, or neglect of themselves. But if after thorough search, with sincerity in the sight of God, our hearts do not condemn, but acquit us, as upright towards him, not willing to allow ourselves in any ill temper or practice, (such as, for instance, this of not loving, or neglecting, our brother), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">then we have confidence</span> (liberty of speech the word literally signifies, which well suits with what follows) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">toward God; </span> we have nothing to hinder or lie as a bar against us in our recourse to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_john/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not,.... Which must be understood, not of a stupidity of mind, as is in unregenerate men, who have no sense of sin, no sorrow for it, or remorse of conscience on account of it; or as is in them who are past feeling; having their consciences seared as with a red hot iron; such cannot be entitled to the advantages that follow; nor is it of persons the apostle speaks, but of himself, and Christians, the beloved of the Lord, and one another, who had an experience of the grace of God upon their souls, and made a profession of religion: nor does it design such a purity of heart and life in believers, as that their hearts do not smite, reproach, and condemn them for sin at any time, for such a state of perfection is not to be attained to and expected in this life; but rather a conscience purged by the blood of Christ, or an heart sprinkled from an evil conscience by that blood, which speaks peace and pardon, so that there is no more conscience of sin, for the removal of which that is applied; and this gives boldness and confidence at the throne of grace: though it is best of all to confine it to the case of brotherly love; for the sense is not, if our heart condemn us not of anything but of the want of brotherly love, or insincerity in it, <p>then have we confidence towards God; or with him, at the throne of his grace: such can draw nigh to him, and stand before him with an holy and humble confidence, when such as hate the brethren, as Cain did, in whom the apostle instances, and those that go in his way, cannot; whose heart condemned him, his conscience smote him, and he went from the presence of the Lord; but those that love the brethren have confidence of their relation to God; by this they know their regeneration, and by that their adoption, and so that they are the children of God; and can therefore draw nigh to God as their Father, and call him so; they can come with an holy boldness and intrepidity of mind before him, and use a  "freedom of speech", with him; can tell him all their mind, pour out their souls unto him, and lay before him their case and wants; they have confidence of his power, faithfulness, and willingness to supply their need, and fulfil all his promises to them, and that their prayers will be heard, answered, and regarded by him in his own time. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{21}</span> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i>then</i> have we confidence toward God.</span><p>(21) A third effect also rises from the former, that in these miseries we are sure to be heard, because we are the sons of God: as we understand by the grace of sanctification which is only for the elect.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-21.htm" title="Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.">1 John 3:21</a>. In this verse the apostle states the case of our heart not accusing (or condemning) us. We can understand it thus, that what he previously observed has happened, namely, that in the consciousness that we are of the truth, we have induced our heart to refrain from its accusation against us. Then this thought does not stand to the preceding one in the relation of antithesis (as if in this verse a different case was contrasted with the case stated in <a href="/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a>), but in that of continuation;[247] but it is more correct to suppose that the apostle is here speaking of a relationship which is different from that indicated in <a href="/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a>, and that he is not regarding the question whether the non-condemnation has never taken place at all, or has been only brought about by persuasion. That two sentences may stand to one another in the relation of antithesis even without the antithetical particle, is proved by chap. <a href="/context/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us....">1 John 1:8-9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παῤῥησίαν ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span>] states what occurs when the case exists which is mentioned by <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span>; it is erroneous to explain <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησίαν ἔχομεν</span> = <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν</span>; the same expression in chap. <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a> and <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>, and construed with <span class="greekheb">πρός</span>, chap. <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1 John 5:14</a>; the same construction in <a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην ἔχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span>.

Contrary to Braune’s opinion, that with this interpretation not <span class="greekheb">μή</span>, but <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι</span> would have to be used, it is to be observed that it was not necessary to bring out the element which is contained in <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_john/3-21.htm" title="Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God....">1 John 3:21-22</a>. <span class="greekheb">παρρησίαν</span>, see note on <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐὰν αἰτῶμεν λαμβάνομεν</span>, though not always in the form we expect or desire; the answer may be different from but it is always better than our prayer. St. Augustine draws a distinction between the hearing of prayer “ad salutem” and “ad voluntatem,” comparing the experience of St. Paul (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure....">2 Corinthians 12:7-9</a>): “Rogasti, clamasti, terclamasti: ipsum semel quod clamasti audivi, non averti aures meas a te; novi quid faciam; tu vis auferri medicamentum quo ureris; ego novi infirmitatem qua gravaris.
