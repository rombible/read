The truth asserted in the preceding verse is so important, and the apostle knew so well that carnal men would be prone to flatter themselves that they might be admitted into heaven after they die, without being holy while they live, that he here enlarges on the important subject. <span class="ital">Whosoever committeth sin </span>— That is, as the apostle here means, known sin, whether by doing actions which God hath forbidden, or by omitting duties which he hath enjoined, or by uttering words which are false, profane, slanderous, malicious, passionate, or trifling and foolish; or by indulging tempers contrary to those of Christ; <span class="ital">transgresseth also the law</span> — The holy, just, and good law of God, and so sets his authority at naught; <span class="ital">for sin is the transgression of the law </span>— Which is implied in the very nature of sin. The apostle’s meaning is, That no one should think lightly of his sins, because every sin, even the least, being a violation of the law of God, if not repented of and pardoned, through faith in Christ, will most certainly be punished. <span class="ital">And ye know that he, </span>Christ, <span class="ital">was manifested</span> — That he came into the world for this very purpose; <span class="ital">to take away </span>— The guilt, power, and pollution of <span class="ital">our sins </span>— By his atoning sacrifice, and the sanctifying influences of his word and Spirit; <span class="ital">and in him is no sin </span>— So that he could not suffer on his own account, but to expiate our sins, and to make us like himself.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:3-10 The sons of God know that their Lord is of purer eyes than to allow any thing unholy and impure to dwell with him. It is the hope of hypocrites, not of the sons of God, that makes allowance for gratifying impure desires and lusts. May we be followers of him as his dear children, thus show our sense of his unspeakable mercy, and express that obedient, grateful, humble mind which becomes us. Sin is the rejecting the Divine law. In him, that is, in Christ, was no sin. All the sinless weaknesses that were consequences of the fall, he took; that is, all those infirmities of mind or body which subject man to suffering, and expose him to temptation. But our moral infirmities, our proneness to sin, he had not. He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ. Beware of self-deceit. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, and to be a follower of Christ, shows an interest by faith in his obedience and sufferings. But a man cannot act like the devil, and at the same time be a disciple of Christ Jesus. Let us not serve or indulge what the Son of God came to destroy. To be born of God is to be inwardly renewed by the power of the Spirit of God. Renewing grace is an abiding principle. Religion is not an art, a matter of dexterity and skill, but a new nature. And the regenerate person cannot sin as he did before he was born of God, and as others do who are not born again. There is that light in his mind, which shows him the evil and malignity of sin. There is that bias upon his heart, which disposes him to loathe and hate sin. There is the spiritual principle that opposes sinful acts. And there is repentance for sin, if committed. It goes against him to sin with forethought. The children of God and the children of the devil have their distinct characters. The seed of the serpent are known by neglect of religion, and by their hating real Christians. He only is righteous before God, as a justified believer, who is taught and disposed to righteousness by the Holy Spirit. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. May all professors of the gospel lay these truths to heart, and try themselves by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law - The law of God given to man as a rule of life. The object of the apostle here is to excite them to holiness, and to deter them from committing sin, perhaps in view of the fact stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>, that everyone who has the hope of heaven will aim to be holy like the Saviour. To confirm this, he shows them that, as a matter of fact, those who are born of God do lead lives of obedience, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5-10</a>; and this he introduces by showing what is the nature of sin, in the verse before us. The considerations by which he would deter them from indulging in sin are the following:<p>(a) all sin is a violation of the law of God, <a href="/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>;<p>(b) the very object of the coming of Christ was to deliver people from sin, <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>;<p>(c) those who are true Christians do not habitually sin, <a href="/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>;<p>(d) those who sin cannot be true Christians, but are of the devil, <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>; and,<p>(e) he who is born of God has a germ or principle of true piety in him, and cannot sin, <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>.<p>It seems evident that the apostle is here combating an opinion which then existed that people might sin, and yet be true Christians, <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>; and he apprehended that there was danger that this opinion would become prevalent. On what ground this opinion was held is unknown. Perhaps it was held that all that was necessary to constitute religion was to embrace the doctrines of Christianity, or to be orthodox in the faith; perhaps that it was not expected that people would become holy in this life, and therefore they might indulge in acts of sin; perhaps that Christ came to modify and relax the law, and that the freedoM which he procured for them was freedom to indulge in whatever people chose; perhaps that, since Christians were heirs of all things, they had a right to enjoy all things; perhaps that the passions of people were so strong that they could not be restrained, and that therefore it was not wrong to give indulgence to the propensities with which our Creator has formed us. All these opinions have been held under various forms of Antinomianism, and it is not at all improbable that some or all of them prevailed in the time of John. The argument which he urges would be applicable to any of them. The consideration which he here states is, that all sin is a transgression of law, and that he who commits it, under whatever pretence, is to be held as a transgressor of the law. The literal rendering of this passage is, "He who doeth sin (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  hamartian ) doeth also transgression" -  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  anomian. Sin is the generic term embracing all that would be wrong. The word transgression (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  anomia) is a specific term, showing where the wrong lay, to wit, in violating the law.<p>For sin is the transgression of the law - That is, all sin involves this as a consequence that it is a violation of the law. The object of the apostle is not so much to define sin, as to deter from its commission by stating what is its essential nature - though he has in fact given the best definition of it that could be given. The essential idea is, that God has given a law to people to regulate their conduct, and that whatever is a departure from that law in any way is held to be sin. The law measures our duty, and measures therefore the degree of guilt when it is not obeyed. The law determines what is right in all cases, and, of course, what is wrong when it is not complied with. The law is the expression of what is the will of God as to what we shall do; and when that is not done, there is sin. The law determines what we shall love or not love; when our passions and appetites shall be bounded and restrained, and to what extent they may be indulged; what shall be our motives and aims in living; how we shall act toward God and toward people; and whenever, in any of these respects, its requirements are not complied with, there is sin.<p>This will include everything in relation to which the law is given, and will embrace what we "omit" to do when the law has commanded a thing to be done, as well as a "positive" act of transgression where the law has forbidden a thing. This idea is properly found in the original word rendered "transgression of the law" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  anomia. This word occurs in the New Testament only in the following places: <a href="/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-28.htm">Matthew 23:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>; <a href="/romans/4-7.htm">Romans 4:7</a>; <a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-12.htm">Hebrews 8:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-17.htm">Hebrews 10:17</a>, in all which places it is rendered "iniquity" and "iniquities;" in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, where it is rendered "unrighteousness;" and in the verse before us twice. It properly means lawlessness, in the sense that the requirements of the law are not conformed to, or complied with; that is, either by not obeying it, or by positively violating it. When a parent commands a child to do a thing, and he does not do it, he is as really guilty of violating the law as when he does a thing which is positively forbidden. This important verse, therefore, may be considered in two aspects - as a definition of the nature of sin, and as an argument against indulgence in it, or against committing it.<p>I. As a definition of the nature of sin. It teaches.<p>(a) that there is a rule of law by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated and governed, and to which it is to be conformed.<p>(b) That there is sin in all cases where that law is not complied with; and that all who do not comply with it are guilty before God.<p>(c) That the particular thing which determines the guilt of sin, and which measures it, is that it is a departure from law, and consequently that there is no sin where there is no departure from law.<p>The essential thing is, that the law has not been respected and obeyed, and sin derives its character and aggravation from that fact. No one can reasonably doubt as to the accuracy of this definition of sin. It is founded on the fact:<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Sin is incompatible with birth from God (1Jo 3:1-3). John often sets forth the same truth negatively, which he had before set forth positively. He had shown, birth from God involves self-purification; he now shows where sin, that is, the want of self-purification, is, there is no birth from God.<p>Whosoever&#8212;Greek, "Every one who."<p>committeth sin&#8212;in contrast to 1Jo 3:3, "Every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself"; and 1Jo 3:7, "He that doeth righteousness."<p>transgresseth &#8230; the law&#8212;Greek, "committeth transgression of law."

The Greek having the article to both, implies that they are convertible terms. The Greek "sin" (hamartia) is literally, "a missing of the mark." God's will being that mark to be ever aimed at. "By the law is the knowledge of sin." The crookedness of a line is shown by being brought into juxtaposition with a straight ruler.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which is added, to signify nothing can be more unreasonable, than the expectation of partaking with God in the glory and blessedness of the future state, if we now allow ourselves in a course of sin, or of transgressing his holy law, which is the very notion of sin; and is again further enforced from the design of our Redeemer. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_john/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whosoever committeth sin,....

The apostle is anxious to emphasize the truth of the thought as being without exception. <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν</span>, as the antithesis of <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν δικαιοσύνην</span>, chap. <a href="/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>, is contrasted with <span class="greekheb">ἁγνίζειν ἑαυτόν</span>, <a href="/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1 John 3:3</a>; as the apostle “wants to contrast with the positive sentence <a href="/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1 John 3:3</a> its negative counterpart,” “he begins with the antithesis of that idea which formed the predicate in <a href="/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1 John 3:3</a>, and makes it the subject” (Ebrard). The definite article shows that the idea, according to its complete extent, is intended as definite, as forming the concrete antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ἡ δικαιοσύνη</span>;[199] both the interpretation of Socinus: “to remain in sin,” and that of Baumgarten-Crusius: “to receive sin into oneself, to let it exist in oneself,” are alike arbitrary; even the very common definition: “to sin knowingly and wilfully,” is out of place here, as the subject here is not the <span class="ital">way in which</span> sin is done, but the actual doing of sin itself. According to Brückner,[200] by <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν</span> “an actual moral tendency of life” is indicated; this explanation is apparently justified by <a href="/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil....">1 John 3:8-9</a>, but even in these passages the apostle’s meaning goes beyond the restricted idea of “tendency of life,” inasmuch as he certainly has sinning in view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ποιεῖ</span>] “<span class="greekheb">καί</span> accentuates the idea that the very doing of <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> is as such equally the doing of <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span>” (Düsterdieck); by <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span> we are to understand, according to the constant <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>, never the mere non-possession of the law (differently <span class="greekheb">ἄνομος</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-21.htm" title="To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.">1 Corinthians 9:21</a>), but always the violation of the law, namely, of the divine law, of the divine order according to which man should regulate his life,—<span class="ital">lawlessness</span> (Lücke).[201] The sense therefore is: he who practises sin (in whatever way it may be) thereby makes himself guilty of the violation of divine order, he acts contrary to the <span class="greekheb">θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, chap. <a href="/1_john/2-17.htm" title="And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God stays for ever.">1 John 2:17</a>.

The apostle does not want to give an exact definition of the idea <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> (contrary to Sander), but to indicate its nature from the side “on which its absolute antagonism to any fellowship with God appears most unrestrictedly” (Brückner). The apostle could not more sharply express the antithesis between the character of the believer, who <span class="ital">is</span> a <span class="greekheb">τέκνον Θεοῦ</span>, and <span class="ital">will be</span> <span class="greekheb">ὅμοιος Θεῷ</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>, than by showing <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> to be <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span>, whereby he most distinctly opposes the moral indifferentism, against which the first section of the Epistle is also directed. Violence is done to the thought, both by limiting the idea <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> to a <span class="ital">particular</span> kind of sin (a Lapide: loquitur proprie de peccato perfecto, puta mortifero), and by making <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span> the subject and <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>, the predicate;[202] so also by mixing up references which are foreign to the context.[203] The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> by which the two sentences are connected with one another, Bengel translates and explains by: immo (so also Brückner by “nay”), with the remark: non solum <span class="ital">conjuncta</span> est notio peccati et iniquitatis, sed <span class="ital">eadem;</span> this is incorrect, for even the first sentence expresses, not a mere connection, but identity. The apostle could have written instead of <span class="greekheb">καί</span> the confirmatory particle <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span>, or the like, but by means of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> the thought of the second clause obtains a more independent position (so also Braune).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[199] Braune, however, rightly observes that too strong an emphasis is not to be laid here, either upon the article or on <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span>, for in ver. 9 it is put <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαν ποιεῖν</span>, and then, as synonymous with it, simply <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνειν</span>; nevertheless, it is to be noticed that “the fuller idea <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμ</span>. at the beginning includes and determines the others, <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν ἁμ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνειν</span>” (Ebrard).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[200] Brückner rightly rejects the interpretation of de Wette: <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> appears to be the broader idea, <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span> the narrower, more definite and stronger, including particular offences, vices, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[201] <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span> is distinguished from <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span> (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-17.htm" title="All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not to death.">1 John 5:17</a>) in this way, that the former idea is contrasted with abstract right (<span class="greekheb">δίκη</span>), the latter with the concrete form of right (<span class="greekheb">νόμος</span>) (Brückner).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[202] Köstlin (p. 246) appeals in behalf of this construction to <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος</span>, assuming that <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἁμαρτία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is to be read; see, however, the critical notes. Against this construction there is, besides, the fact that <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> would have to be taken in a different sense here from that in which it is previously used, namely, as Köstlin says: “The first time <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> means sinful action, the second time guilt in the sight of God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[203] This is the case, for example, in Hilgenfeld’s explanation: “Not every one who deviates from the <span class="ital">ceremonial laws</span>, but only the sinner, falls under the category of <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span>;” not less in the remark of Calvin: “the sum of the thought is that the life of those who give themselves to sin <span class="ital">is hateful to God, and cannot be tolerated by God.</span>”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_john/3-4.htm" title="Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law....">1 John 3:4-12</a>. The Obligation of our Dignity as Children of God. “Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. And ye know that He was manifested that He might take away the sins; and sin in Him there is not. Every one that abideth in Him doth not keep sinning; every one that keepeth sinning hath not seen Him nor got to know Him. Little children, let no one lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous; he that doeth sin is of the Devil, because from the beginning the Devil keepeth sinning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that He might undo the works of the Devil. Every one that hath been begotten of God doeth not sin, because His seed in him abideth; and he cannot keep sinning, because of God he hath been begotten. Herein are manifest the children of God and the children of the Devil: every one that doeth not righteousness is not of God, and he that loveth not his brother. Because this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we love one another. Not as Cain was of the Evil One and slew his brother. And wherefore did he slay him? Because his works were evil, but his brother’s righteous.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. As so often, the Apostle emphasizes his statement by giving the opposite case, and not the simple opposite, but an expansion of it. Instead of saying ‘every one that hath not this hope’ he says <span class="bld">every one that doeth</span> <span class="ital">sin</span>. The A. V. not only obscures this antithesis by changing ‘every man’ to ‘whosoever’, but also the contrast between ‘doing righteousness’ (<a href="/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>) and ‘doing sin’ by changing from ‘do’ to ‘commit’. This contrast is all the more marked in the Greek because both words have the article; ‘doeth the righteousness’, ‘doeth the sin’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">transgresseth also the law</span>] This is very unfortunate, destroying the parallelism: <span class="ital">Every man that</span> <span class="bld">doeth</span> <span class="ital">sin</span>, <span class="bld">doeth</span> <span class="ital">also</span> <span class="bld">lawlessness</span>. It is imperative to have the same verb in both clauses and also in <a href="/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a> : to do sin is to do lawlessness, and this is the opposite of to do righteousness. The one marks the children of God, the other the children of the devil. ‘Lawlessness’ both in English and Greek (<span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span>) means not the <span class="ital">privation</span> of law, but the <span class="ital">disregard</span> of it: not the having no law, but the acting as if one had none. This was precisely the case with some of the Gnostic teachers: they declared that their superior enlightenment placed them above the moral law; they were neither the better for keeping it nor the worse for breaking it. Sin and lawlessness, says the Apostle, are convertible terms: they are merely different aspects of the same state. And it is in its aspect of disregard of God’s law that sin is seen to be quite irreconcilable with being a child of God and having fellowship with God. See on <a href="/1_john/5-17.htm" title="All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not to death.">1 John 5:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note that throughout these verses (3–15) S. John uses the strong expression, ‘<span class="ital">Every</span> man that’ and not simply ‘He that.’ It has been suggested that “in each case where this characteristic form of language occurs there is apparently a reference to some who had questioned the application of a general principle in particular cases” (Westcott): comp. <a href="/1_john/2-23.htm" title="Whoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father: he that acknowledges the Son has the Father also.">1 John 2:23</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>, <a href="/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1 John 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-4.htm" title="For whatever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.">1 John 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1 John 5:18</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-9.htm" title="Whoever transgresses, and stays not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God.
