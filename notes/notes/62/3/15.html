This love is the special fruit of our faith, and a certain sign of our being born again. But none who rightly know the heart of man, can wonder at the contempt and enmity of ungodly people against the children of God. We know that we are passed from death to life: we may know it by the evidences of our faith in Christ, of which love to our brethren is one. It is not zeal for a party in the common religion, or affection for those who are of the same name and sentiments with ourselves. The life of grace in the heart of a regenerate person, is the beginning and first principle of a life of glory, whereof they must be destitute who hate their brother in their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer ... - That is, he has the spirit of a murderer; he has that which, if it were acted out, would lead him to commit murder, as it did Cain. The private malice, the secret grudge, the envy which is cherished in the heart, is murderous in its tendency, and were it not for the outward restraints of human laws, and the dread of punishment, it would often lead to the act of murder. The apostle does not say that he who hates his brother, though he does not in fact commit murder, is guilty to the same degree as if he had actually done it; but he evidently means to say that the spirit which would lead to murder is there, and that God will hold him responsible for it. Nothing is missing but the removal of outward restraints to lead to the commission of the open deed, and God judges people as he sees them to be "in their hearts." What a fearful declaration, then, is this! How many real murderers there are on the earth besides those who are detected and punished, and besides those open violators of the laws of God and man who go at large! And who is them that should not feel humbled and penitent in view of his own heart, and grateful for that sovereign mercy which has restrained him from open acts of guilt - for who is there who has not at some period of his life, and perhaps often, indulged in feelings of hatred, and envy, and malice toward others, which, if acted out, would have led to the commission of the awful crime of taking human life? Any man may well shudder at the remembrance of the secret sins of his own heart, and at the thought of what he would have been but for the restraining grace of God. And how wonderful is that grace which, in the case of the true Christian, not only restrains and checks, but which effectually subdues all these feelings, and implants in their place the principles of love! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. hateth&#8212;equivalent to "loveth not" (1Jo 3:14); there is no medium between the two.

"Whereas, 1Jo 3:16 desires us to lay down our lives for the brethren; duels require one (awful to say!) to risk his own life, rather than not deprive another of life" [Bengel].

Every one who hates his brother is a murderer, not merely inasmuch as hatred sometimes leads to murder, but because by his nature he is inclined to the destruction of his brother, and if he does not attain this object is only hindered from it by other opposing forces. As in the moral life it is not the outward act in itself, but the intention, that is of consequence, every one who lives in hatred towards his brother must by the moral consciousness (or by God, Drusius, Hornejus) be regarded as a murderer; comp. <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:">Matthew 5:21</a> ff., <a href="/context/matthew/5-27.htm" title="You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:...">Matthew 5:27-28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hence it is clear that the real thought of the apostle is missed when <span class="greekheb">μισεῖν</span> is here limited to the odium perfectum (Hornejus).

He that loves not his brother stays in death.">1 John 3:14</a> was described by the simple word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΩΉ</span></span></span>; and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧΕΙ</span></span></span> is to be retained as the actual present; erroneously a Lapide: non habebit gloriam vitae.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The adjective <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΟΥΣΑΝ</span></span></span> Lücke, with whom Sander agrees, appealing to the parable of the unmerciful servant, explains by the fact that John is speaking to Christians who already had some part in eternal life. But the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Πᾶς Ὁ ΜΙΣῶΝ</span></span></span> shows that John is here speaking quite generally, and, indeed, in order to confirm the preceding thought: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΜῊ ἈΓΑΠῶΝ ΜΈΝΕΙ ἘΝ Τῷ ΘΑΝΆΤῼ</span></span></span>; it must therefore be the condition of those who form the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΣΜΟς</span></span></span> (to whom also the mere nominal Christians belong), of those accordingly who have no part in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΩῊ ΑἸΏΝΙΟς</span></span></span>, that is stated. By <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΟΥΣΑΝ</span></span></span> is therefore not suggested the <span class="ital">loss</span> of a previously possessed good; just as little as in the corresponding passage, Gospel of <a href="/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a> : <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔχετε ἐν ὑμῖν μένοντα</span>, where also the meaning is not that those addressed have previously had the word of God, for this is distinctly denied in <a href="/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΟΥΣΑΝ</span></span></span> is rather explained by the fact that he alone really has the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΩῊ ΑἸΏΝΙΟς</span></span></span> in whom it abides (comp. chap. <a href="/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1 John 2:19</a>); <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span> expresses here also, according to John’s <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>, the idea of <span class="ital">being</span> in a strengthened degree, and may accordingly be used quite apart from any reference to the previous state; <span class="greekheb">μένουσαν</span> is to be connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span>; he has not the life abiding, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> surely and firmly existing, in him.[227]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[226] Wrongly Nicol. de Lyra: odisse pejus quam non diligere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[227] It is incorrect to say, with Braune: “by <span class="greekheb">μένουσαν</span> the existence of eternal life from baptism, etc., is indicated,” since in the context there is no reference whatever to baptism, instruction, etc., and the advantage resulting therefrom. Weiss artificially explains: “John supposes the case of a person having eternal life, and now goes so far as to say that even such an one may not have it permanently at least, but may be in the condition of losing it if by hating his brother he becomes a murderer;” such a case John would not and could not at all assume. Very strange is Ebrard’s interpretation: “<span class="ital">supposing</span> that the murderer <span class="ital">had</span> at the time the <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ αἰώνιος</span> in him (which, however, according to ver. 9, is not possible in the full (!) sense), yet this <span class="ital">would</span> not remain in him, he would again fall away from the <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> (which just for this reason could not be <span class="ital">genuine</span>),” as well as his assertion that <span class="greekheb">ζωὴν αἰών</span>. is here used without the article, because John could not ascribe to him who is not a true child of God “<span class="ital">the</span> eternal life,” but “eternal life,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> powers of the future world. Comp. against this, <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a>.

Quite as a matter of course S. John passes from not loving to hating. The crisis caused in the world by the coming of the light leaves no neutral ground: all is either light or darkness, of God or of the evil one, of the Church or of the world, in love or in hate. A Christian cannot be neither loving nor hating, any more than a plant can be neither growing nor dying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is a murderer</span>] Or, as most of the earlier Versions, <span class="ital">is a manslayer</span>. The word (<span class="greekheb">ἀνθρωποκτόνος</span>) occurs only here and <a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>. The mention of Cain just before renders it certain that ‘murderer’ is not to be understood figuratively as ‘<span class="ital">soul</span>-destroyer’. Human law considers overt acts; God considers motives. The motives of the hater and of the murderer are the same: the fact that one is, and the other is not, deterred by laziness or fear from carrying out his hatred into homicidal action, makes no difference in the moral character of the men, though it makes all the difference in the eyes of the law. This is only applying to the sixth commandment the principle which the Lord Himself applies to the seventh (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.">Matthew 5:28</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye know that no murderer</span>] Once more (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/3-14.htm" title="We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He that loves not his brother stays in death.">1 John 3:14</a></span>) the Apostle appeals to their consciousness as Christians (<span class="greekheb">οἴδατε</span>): it is not a matter of experience gradually acquired (<span class="greekheb">γινώσκετε</span>), but of knowledge once for all possessed. He who is a murderer at heart cannot along with the deadly spirit which he cherishes have eternal life as a sure possession. Comp. ‘Ye <span class="ital">have not</span> His word <span class="ital">abiding in</span> you,’ <a href="/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>. S. John of course does not mean that hatred or murder is a sin for which there is no forgiveness. But ‘the soul that sinneth, it shall <span class="ital">die</span>’; and the sin of which the special tendency is destruction of life is absolutely incompatible with the possession of eternal life. ‘But for … murderers … their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death’ (<a href="/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>). Here, as elsewhere, S. John speaks of eternal life as something which the Christian already <span class="ital">has</span>, not which he hopes to <span class="ital">win</span>: comp. <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>; <a href="/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>; <a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47</a>; <a href="/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>, &c.

All hatred is an attempt against life: but life [spiritual] does not assail life [physical]. He who hates his brother desires either that his brother or himself should not live.

This is the part of desperate insanity, far removed from bravery. We may suppose that the devil himself wonders how men, bearing also the Christian name, can have fallen so low. It is to be lamented that the men of chief authority in the world, with all the power that has been entrusted to them by God, either are not able, or not willing, to suppress duels. One single atrocity of this kind has power to involve in the direst guilt before God the whole human race, the whole assembly of Christians, or a whole camp of soldiers.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - As in <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>, St. John passes at once from not loving to hating, treating the two as equivalent. He takes no account of the neutral ground of indifference. He that is not for his brother is against him. Indifference is hate quiescent, there being nothing to excite it. Love is the only security against hate. And as every one who does not love is potentially a hater, so every hater is potentially a murderer. A murderer is a hater who expresses his hatred in the most emphatic way. A hater who does not murder abstains for various reasons from this extreme way of expressing his hate. But the temper of the two men is the same; and it is obvious (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "ye know what needs no evidence") that every murderer is incapable of possessing eternal life. It is the murderous temper, not the act of homicide, that excludes from eternal life. St. John, of course, does not mean that murder is an unpardonable sin; but he shows that hate and death go together, as love and life, and that the two pairs are mutually exclusive. How can life and the desire to extinguish life be compatible?

"With regard to the practice of homicide, the ordinary Greek morality was extremely loose.... Among the Greeks, to have killed a man was considered in the light of misfortune, or, at most, a prudential error, when the perpetrator of the act had come among strangers as a fugitive for protection and hospitality. On the spot, therefore, where the crime occurred, it could stand only as in the nature of a private and civil wrong, and the fine payable was regarded, not (which it might have been) as a mode, however defective, of marking any guilt in the culprit, but as, on the whole, an equitable satisfaction to the wounded feelings of the relatives and friends, or as an actual compensation for the lost services of the dead man. The religion of the age takes no notice of the act whatever" (Gladstone "Homer and the Homeric Age," ii., 436). </body></html>
