It is the hope of hypocrites, not of the sons of God, that makes allowance for gratifying impure desires and lusts. May we be followers of him as his dear children, thus show our sense of his unspeakable mercy, and express that obedient, grateful, humble mind which becomes us. Sin is the rejecting the Divine law. In him, that is, in Christ, was no sin. All the sinless weaknesses that were consequences of the fall, he took; that is, all those infirmities of mind or body which subject man to suffering, and expose him to temptation. But our moral infirmities, our proneness to sin, he had not. He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ. Beware of self-deceit. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, and to be a follower of Christ, shows an interest by faith in his obedience and sufferings. But a man cannot act like the devil, and at the same time be a disciple of Christ Jesus. Let us not serve or indulge what the Son of God came to destroy. To be born of God is to be inwardly renewed by the power of the Spirit of God. Renewing grace is an abiding principle. Religion is not an art, a matter of dexterity and skill, but a new nature. And the regenerate person cannot sin as he did before he was born of God, and as others do who are not born again. There is that light in his mind, which shows him the evil and malignity of sin. There is that bias upon his heart, which disposes him to loathe and hate sin. There is the spiritual principle that opposes sinful acts. And there is repentance for sin, if committed. It goes against him to sin with forethought. The children of God and the children of the devil have their distinct characters. The seed of the serpent are known by neglect of religion, and by their hating real Christians. He only is righteous before God, as a justified believer, who is taught and disposed to righteousness by the Holy Spirit. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. May all professors of the gospel lay these truths to heart, and try themselves by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In this the children of God are manifest ... - That is, this furnishes a test of their true character. The test is found in doing righteousness, and in the love of the brethren. The former he had illustrated; the latter he now proceeds to illustrate. The general idea is, that if a person is not truly a righteous person, and does not love the brethren, he cannot be a child of God. Perhaps by the phrase in this, using a pronoun in the singular number, he means to intimate that an important part of righteousness consists in brotherly love.<p>Whosoever doeth not righteousness, is not of God - In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>, he had said that "he that doeth righteousness is of God."<p>If that is true, then what he here affirms must be true also, that a man who does not righteousness is not of God. The general idea is the same, that no one can be a true Christian who is not in fact a righteous man.<p>Neither he that loveth not his brother - The illustration of this point continues to <a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>. The general sense is, that brotherly love is essential to the Christian character, and that he who does not possess it cannot be a Christian.

John’s disciple Polycarp, in words which read like an adaptation of this text, “I know thee for the <span class="ital">firstborn of Satan</span>” (Iren. <span class="ital">Haer.</span> III. iii. 4). And in his Epistle (VII. 1) Polycarp writes, “Whosoever does not confess the witness of the cross is <span class="ital">of the devil</span>”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither he that loveth not his brother</span>] Here again note the way in which S. John’s divisions shade off into one another (see on <a href="/context/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming....">1 John 2:28-29</a>). Doing righteousness, the mark of God’s children, suggests the thought of brotherly love, for love is <span class="ital">righteousness in relation to others;</span> ‘For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself’ (<a href="/galatians/5-14.htm" title="For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Galatians 5:14</a>). Love suggests its opposite, hate; and these two form the subject of the next paragraph. Some editors would make the new section begin here in the middle of <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a></span>. It is perhaps better to draw the line between <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous....">1 John 3:12-13</a></span>, considering <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_john/3-11.htm" title="For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another....">1 John 3:11-12</a></span> as transitional.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘He that loveth not his brother is not of God’, for a child of God will love all whom God loves. This prepares us for the statements in <a href="/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?...">1 John 4:20-21</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν τούτῳ</span>, <span class="ital">in this</span>) This is to be referred to the preceding words.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν</span>, <span class="ital">and he who does not love</span>) A transition from the genus, or the whole to a part.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The question whether "in this" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> refers to what precedes or to what follows is here unimportant, for both are similar in meaning; and "in this" may refer to both. "By their fruits ye shall know them." The children of God do righteousness, and not sin; the children of the devil do sin, and not righteousness. Of course, moral parentage is meant in both cases. Nothing here lends any countenance to the view that the writer is a dualist and inculcates two principles of existence - God and the devil. All, whether good or bad, are God's creatures (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>); but while all are his children by creation, some become his children spiritually also, while others become the children of Satan. St. John's "teaching about the devil is not at all agreeable to those who dwell exclusively on the sunny aspects of the world and of life, and would shut their eyes to what is dark and terrible. They like to hear of a Being who is all-gracious and loving; the vision of one who is the enemy of all that is gracious and loving shocks them - they wish to suppose that it belongs to the world's infancy, and that it disappears as we know more" (Maurice). The expression, "the children of the devil," must not be confounded with the Hebraistic expressions, "children of perdition, children of darkness," <span class="accented">"children</span> of light, son of death," "son of perdition," etc. As so often, St. John not only restates the case in a new form, but adds a new thought to it - he that loveth not his brother. This forms the link with the next section (verses 13-24), on brotherly love. Of all failures in doing righteousness this is the most conspicuous  - failing to love one's brother. And who is my brother? The answer is the same as to the question, "And who is my neighbour?" Mankind at large. The meaning cannot be limited to the children of God. Even <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (verses 14, 16) does not exclude unbelievers, still less does <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. This is confirmed: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> By the fact that the opposite case (verse 13) is the children of the world hating <span class="accented">Christians</span>; the true opposite of Christians loving Christians would be the children of the world hating <span class="accented">one another.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> By the cited example of Christ (verse 16), who died for us when we were aliens from God. Of course, if the Christian must love all men, <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> he must love Christians. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In this (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>See on <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>.<p>Children of the devil (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>The only occurrence of the phrase.
