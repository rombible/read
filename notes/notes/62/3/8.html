It is the hope of hypocrites, not of the sons of God, that makes allowance for gratifying impure desires and lusts. May we be followers of him as his dear children, thus show our sense of his unspeakable mercy, and express that obedient, grateful, humble mind which becomes us. Sin is the rejecting the Divine law. In him, that is, in Christ, was no sin. All the sinless weaknesses that were consequences of the fall, he took; that is, all those infirmities of mind or body which subject man to suffering, and expose him to temptation. But our moral infirmities, our proneness to sin, he had not. He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ. Beware of self-deceit. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, and to be a follower of Christ, shows an interest by faith in his obedience and sufferings. But a man cannot act like the devil, and at the same time be a disciple of Christ Jesus. Let us not serve or indulge what the Son of God came to destroy. To be born of God is to be inwardly renewed by the power of the Spirit of God. Renewing grace is an abiding principle. Religion is not an art, a matter of dexterity and skill, but a new nature. And the regenerate person cannot sin as he did before he was born of God, and as others do who are not born again. There is that light in his mind, which shows him the evil and malignity of sin. There is that bias upon his heart, which disposes him to loathe and hate sin. There is the spiritual principle that opposes sinful acts. And there is repentance for sin, if committed. It goes against him to sin with forethought. The children of God and the children of the devil have their distinct characters. The seed of the serpent are known by neglect of religion, and by their hating real Christians. He only is righteous before God, as a justified believer, who is taught and disposed to righteousness by the Holy Spirit. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. May all professors of the gospel lay these truths to heart, and try themselves by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that committeth sin - Habitually, willfully, characteristically.<p>Is of the devil - This cannot mean that no one who commits any sin, or who is not absolutely perfect, can be a Christian, for this would cut off the great mass, even according to the belief of those who hold that the Christian may be perfectly holy, from all claim to the Christian character. But what the apostle here says is true in two senses:<p>(1) That all who commit sin, even true believers, so far as they are imperfect, in this respect resemble Satan, and are under his influence, since sin, just so far as it exists at all, makes us resemble him.<p>(2) all who habitually and characteristically sin are of the devil." This latter was evidently the principal idea in the mind of the apostle. His object here is to show that those who sinned, in the sense in which it would seem some maintained that the children of God might sin, could have no real evidence of piety, but really belonged to Satan.<p>For the devil sinneth from the beginning - The beginning of the world; or from the first account we have of him. It does not mean that he sinned from the beginning of his existence, for he was made holy like the other angels. Notes, Jde 1:6. The meaning is, that he introduced sin into the universe, and that he has continued to practice it ever since. The word sinneth here implies continued and habitual sin. He did not commit one act of sin and then reform; but he has continued, and still continues, his course of sin. This may confirm what has been already said about the kind of sin that John refers to. He speaks of sinning habitually, continuously, willfully; and anyone who does this shows that he is under the influence of him whose characteristic it has been and is to sin.<p>For this purpose the Son of God was manifested - Became incarnate, and appeared among people, <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>.

He that committeth sin is of the devil&#8212;in contrast to "He that doeth righteousness," 1Jo 3:7. He is a son of the devil (1Jo 3:10; Joh 8:44). John does not, however, say, "born of the devil." as he does "born of God," for "the devil begets none, nor does he create any; but whoever imitates the devil becomes a child of the devil by imitating him, not by proper birth" [Augustine, Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John, Homily 4.10]. From the devil there is not generation, but corruption [Bengel].<p>sinneth from the beginning&#8212;from the time that any began to sin [Alford]: from the time that he became what he is, the devil.

Since the fall of man [at the beginning of our world] the devil is (ever) sinning (this is the force of "sinneth"; he has sinned from the beginning, is the cause of all sins, and still goes on sinning; present). As the author of sin, and prince of this world, he has never ceased to seduce man to sin [Luecke].<p>destroy&#8212;break up and do away with; bruising and crushing the serpent's head.<p>works of the devil&#8212;sin, and all its awful consequences.

A worker or maker of sin, (as we may fitly render this o poiwn thn amartian), is an habitual or customary sinner; one that sinneth with deliberation, not by surprise, from a prevailing habit, that either continueth him in a course of actual known sin, or that withholds him from repenting sincerely, and turning to God from the sin which he hath committed; by which repentance he should not only refrain from further gross acts of sin, (which an impenitent person upon other inducements may do), but mortify and prevail against all sinful habits and inclinations.

Not everyone that sins, or commits acts of sin, then every man is of the devil, because no man lives without the commission of sin; but he who makes sin his constant business, and the employment of his life, whose life is a continued series of sinning, he is of the devil; not as to origin and substance, or by proper generation, as some have literally understood the words; but by imitation, being like him, and so of him their father, doing his lusts, living continually in sin, as he does, and so resemble him, as children do their parents; and hereby also appear to be under his government and influence, to be led captive by him at his will, and so to belong to him, and such as will have their part and portion with him in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, so living and dying: <p>for the devil sinneth from the beginning; not of his creation, for he was made by God a pure and holy creature; but from the beginning of the world, or near it, at least from the beginning of man's creation; for he not only sinned by rebelling against God himself, and by drawing in the rest of the apostate angels into the rebellion with him, but by tempting man, as soon as created, to sin against God: what was his first and particular sin is not certain, whether pride or envy, or what; seems to be, his not abiding in the truth, or an opposition to the truth of the Gospel, respecting the incarnation of the Son of God, mentioned in the following clause; see <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>; however, he has been continually sinning ever since: he "sinneth"; he is always sinning, doing nothing else but sin; so that he that lives a vicious course of life is like him, and manifestly of him: <p>for this purpose the Son of God was manifested; in human nature, as in <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>; whence it appears that he was the Son of God before his incarnation, and so not by it; he did not become so through it, nor was he denominated such on account of it; he was not made the Son of God by it, but was manifested in it what he was before; and for this end: <p>that he might destroy the works of the devil; and the devil himself, and all his dominion and power, and particularly his power over death, and death itself; and especially the sins of men, which are the works of the devil, which he puts them upon, influences them to do, and takes delight in; and which are destroyed by Christ, by his sacrifice and death, being taken, carried, removed away, finished, and made an end of by him; See Gill on <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> He that committeth sin is of the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> devil; for the devil <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> sinneth from the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> beginning.

For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.">1 John 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ποιῶν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν</span>] forms the diametrical opposite of <span class="greekheb">ὁ ποιῶν τὴν δικαιοσύνην</span>, inasmuch as it signifies the man whose life is a service of sin, “who lives in sin as his element” (Sander). While the former belongs to Christ, and is a <span class="greekheb">τέκνον Θεοῦ</span>, the latter is <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> does not signify here either merely connection (de Wette), or similarity (Paulus), or imitation (Semler), but, as the expression <span class="greekheb">τέκνον τοῦ διαβόλου</span> (<a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>) shows, origin (so also Ebrard): the life that animates the sinner emanates from the devil; “not as if the devil created him, but that he introduced the evil into him” (Russmeyer). The apostle confirms the truth of this statement by the following words: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἀπ</span> ̓ <span class="greekheb">ἀρχῆς ὁ διάβολος ἁμαρτάνει</span>. The words <span class="greekheb">ἀπ</span> ̓ <span class="greekheb">ἀρχῆς</span> are put first, because the chief emphasis rests on them, inasmuch as those who commit sin are <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου</span>, not because he sins, but because it is he who sinneth <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span>. From this expression it must not, with Frommann and Hilgenfeld, be inferred that John was considering the devil as an originally evil being,—in dualistic fashion (comp. Köstlin, p. 127, and Weiss, p. 132 ff.),—for John is not here speaking of the <span class="ital">being</span>, but of the <span class="ital">action</span> of the devil. In order not to accuse John of the Manichaean dualism, the attempt has been made to define <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span> more particularly, either by referring it to the creation of the world (Calvin, S. G. Lange; also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> 2d ed. I. 429: “since the beginning of the world,” or: “from the beginning of history, in the course of which the sin of men has begun”), or to res humanae (Semler), or to the time of the devil’s fall (Bengel: ex quo diabolus est diabolus); but all these supplements are purely arbitrary. Many modern commentators take the expression in reference to the sin of man, and find this idea expressed in it, that “the devil is related to all the sins of men as the first and seductive originator” (Nitzsch, <span class="ital">Syst. der christlichen Lchre</span>, 6th ed. p. 244 f.); thus Lücke, Düsterdieck, Ebrard, Weiss, Braune, and previously in this commentary; but this thought, while it no doubt lies in the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου</span> and in the following <span class="greekheb">τέκνον τοῦ διαβόλου</span>, and hence in the thesis to be established, does not lie in this confirmatory clause, apart from the fact that in <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς ἁμαρτάνει</span> no reference is indicated to the sin of man. It is otherwise in <a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>, where the more particular definition of the relation of the devil to men is supplied with <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span> from the context (“since he has put himself in connection with men”); here, on the contrary, John does not say: “what the devil is to men, but what is his relationship to God” (Hofmann as above); but as he describes his relationship by <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς ἁμαρτάνει</span>, as a sinning which has continued from the beginning, this can only mean that the devil’s first action was sin, and that he has remained and remains in that action. Likewise in the interpretation which Brückner gives of <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span>: “<span class="ital">i.e.</span> so long as there is sin,” <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span> does not receive its full force.[211]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The present <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΆΝΕΙ</span></span></span> describes the sinning of the devil as uninterruptedly continuous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΤΟῦΤΟ ἘΦΑΝΕΡΏΘΗ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] As <a href="/context/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him....">1 John 3:6-7</a> refer to the second part of <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1 John 3:5</a>, these words refer to the first part of that verse; they not only express the antithesis between Christ and the devil, but they bring out the fact that the appearance of Christ has for its object the destruction of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΡΓΑ ΤΟῦ ΔΙΑΒΌΛΟΥ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαι</span> which are wrought by him (not “the reward of sin,” Calov, Spener; nor “the agency that seduces to sin,” de Wette). <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΎΕΙΝ</span></span></span> is used here as in <a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a> (similarly <a href="/context/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up....">2 Peter 3:10-12</a>), in the meaning of “<span class="ital">to destroy</span>;” less naturally some commentators (a Lapide, Lorinus, Spener, Besser, etc.) maintain the meaning “to undo,” sins being regarded as the snares of the devil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[211] The idea that the devil, before he sinned, was for a time without sin, is nowhere expressed in Scripture; neither in <a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.

And, as before, the present participle indicates the <span class="ital">habitual</span> doer of sin. Such an one has the devil as the source (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>), not of his existence, but of the evil which rules his existence and is the main element in it. “The devil made no man, begat no man, created no man: but whoso imitates the devil, becomes a child of the devil, as if begotten of him. In what sense art thou a child of Abraham? Not that Abraham begat thee. In the same sense as that in which the Jews, the children of Abraham, by not imitating the faith of Abraham, are become children of the devil” (S. Augustine). It is one of the characteristics of these closing words of N. T. that they mark with singular precision the personality of Satan, and his relation to sin, sinners, and redemption from sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the devil sinneth from the beginning</span>] Or, <span class="bld">because from the beginning the devil sinneth</span>. ‘From the beginning’ stands first for emphasis. What does it mean? Various explanations have been suggested. (1) From the beginning of <span class="ital">sin</span>. The devil was the first to sin and has never ceased to sin. (2) From the beginning of the <span class="ital">devil</span>. This comes very near to asserting the Gnostic and Manichaean error of two co-eternal principles or Creators, one good and one evil. The very notion of sin involves departure from what is good. The good therefore must have existed first. To avoid this, (3) from the beginning of the devil <span class="ital">as such</span>, i.e. from the time of his becoming the devil, or (4) from the beginning of his <span class="ital">activity;</span> which is not very different from (3) if one believes that he is a fallen angel, or from (2) if one does not. (5) From the beginning of the <span class="ital">world</span>. (6) From the beginning of the <span class="ital">human race</span>. The first or last seems best. “The phrase ‘From the beginning’ intimates that there has been no period of the existence of human beings in which they have not been liable to the assaults of this Tempter; that accusations against God, reasons for doubting and distrusting Him, have been offered to one man after another, to one generation after another. This is just what the Scripture affirms; just the assumption which goes through the book from Genesis to the Apocalypse.” (Maurice.) Note the present tense: not he has sinned, but he is sinning; his whole existence is sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Son of God</span>] In special contrast to those habitual sinners who are morally the children of the devil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that he might destroy</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">that he might unloose</span> or <span class="ital">dissolve</span> or <span class="ital">undo</span>. All destruction is dissolution. The metaphor here has probably nothing to do with loosening bonds or snares. It is a favourite one with S. John; ‘<span class="ital">Destroy</span> this sanctuary’ (<a href="/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>).

If the devil committed the first sin, and has sinned unceasingly ever since, then whoever sins is akin to him, is morally his offspring (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). There is the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the evil one, and man cannot find or make a third domain; if he is not in the one he is in the other. This verse, like <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, seems to be conclusive as to the personal existence of the devil. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> balances <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: if the one is a mere personification of a tendency, why not the other? Both should be personal or neither. "It is not true that St. John speaks so confidently of a devil because he was a Jew and was filled with Hebrew opinions. For once that the devil is introduced in the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets, he is spoken of twenty times in any Gospel or Epistle" (Maurice), and not least in the Gentile Luke. With the latter half of verse 8. comp, verse 5. Christ's act in removing our sins from us destroys the devil's works; for by the manifestation of the Light (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>) the darkness is dispersed and destroyed. Our sins are the evil one's works: what is sin in us is his natural occupation.
