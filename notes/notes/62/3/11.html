<span class="ital">from the beginning — </span>Of our ministry among you; <span class="ital">that we should love one another </span>— A doctrine frequently inculcated by our Lord Jesus in person: <span class="ital">not as Cain, </span>(see the margin,) <span class="ital">who was of the wicked one </span>— Who showed he was a child of the devil, by killing his brother. <span class="ital">And wherefore slew he him? </span>— For any fault?

This love is the special fruit of our faith, and a certain sign of our being born again. But none who rightly know the heart of man, can wonder at the contempt and enmity of ungodly people against the children of God. We know that we are passed from death to life: we may know it by the evidences of our faith in Christ, of which love to our brethren is one. It is not zeal for a party in the common religion, or affection for those who are of the same name and sentiments with ourselves. The life of grace in the heart of a regenerate person, is the beginning and first principle of a life of glory, whereof they must be destitute who hate their brother in their hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this is the message - Margin, "commandment."

Jerome tells us that during S. John’s last years ‘Little children, love one another’ was the one exhortation which, after he had become too old to preach, he never ceased to give. “It is the Lord’s command,” he said; “and if this is done, it is enough.” ‘Love one another’ addressed to Christians must primarily mean the love of Christians to fellow-Christians; and this shews what ‘loving his brother’ must mean.
