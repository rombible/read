Surely we should love those whom God has loved, and so loved. The Holy Spirit, grieved at selfishness, will leave the selfish heart without comfort, and full of darkness and terror. By what can it be known that a man has a true sense of the love of Christ for perishing sinners, or that the love of God has been planted in his heart by the Holy Spirit, if the love of the world and its good overcomes the feelings of compassion to a perishing brother? Every instance of this selfishness must weaken the evidences of a man's conversion; when habitual and allowed, it must decide against him. If conscience condemn us in known sin, or the neglect of known duty, God does so too. Let conscience therefore be well-informed, be heard, and diligently attended to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But whoso hath this world's good - Has property - called "this world's good," or a good pertaining to this world, because it is of value to us only as it meets our wants this side of the grave; and perhaps also because it is sought supremely by the people of the world. The general meaning of this verse, in connection with the previous verse, is, that if we ought to be willing to lay down our lives for others, we ought to be willing to make those comparatively smaller sacrifices which are necessary to relieve them in their distresses; and that if we are unwilling to do this, we can have no evidence that the love of God dwells in us.<p>And seeth his brother have need - Need of food, of raiment, of shelter; or sick, and poor, and unable to provide for his own wants and those of his family.<p>And shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him - The bowels, or "upper viscera," embracing the heart, and the region of the chest generally, are in the Scriptures represented as the seat of mercy, piety, and compassion, because when the mind feels compassion it is that part which is affected.

The possessions of this world, worldly substance, the temporal good things of it; for there are some things in it, which are honestly, pleasantly, and profitably good, when used lawfully, and not abused, otherwise they are to the owner's hurt: or "the living of this world"; that which the men of the world give up themselves to, are bent upon, and pursue after; or on which men live, and by which life is maintained, and preserved, and made comfortable in the present state of things; such as meat, drink, apparel, money, houses, lands, &amp;c. The Ethiopic version renders it, "he that hath the government of this world"; as if it pointed at a person that is in some high office of worldly honour and profit, and is both great and rich; but the words are not to be restrained to such an one only, but refer to any man that has any share of the outward enjoyments of life; that has not only a competency for himself and family, but something to spare, and especially that has an affluence of worldly substance; but of him that has not, it is not required; for what a man distributes ought to be his own, and not another's, and in proportion to what he has, or according to his ability: <p>and seeth his brother have need; meaning, not merely a brother in that strict and natural relation, or bond of consanguinity; though such an one in distress ought to be, in the first place, regarded, for no man should hide himself from, overlook and neglect his own flesh and blood; but any, and every man, "his neighbour", as the Ethiopic version reads, whom he ought to love as himself; and especially a brother in a spiritual relation, or one that is of the household of faith: if he has need; that is, is naked and destitute of daily food, has not the common supplies of life, and what nature requires; and also, whose circumstances are low and mean, though not reduced to the utmost extremity; and if he sees him in this distress with his own eyes, or if he knows it, hears of it, and is made acquainted with it, otherwise he cannot be blameworthy for not relieving him. <p>And shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him; hardens his heart, turns away his eyes, and shuts his hand; has no tenderness in him for, nor sympathy with his distressed brother, nor gives him any succour: and this shows, that when relief is given, it should be not in a morose and churlish manner, with reflection and reproach, but with affection and pity; and where there is neither one nor the other, <p>how dwelleth the love of God in him? neither the love with which God loves men; for if this was shed abroad in him, and had a place, and dwelt in him, and he was properly affected with it, it would warm his heart, and loosen his affections, and cause his bowels to move to his poor brother: nor the love with which God is loved; for if he does not love his brother whom he sees in distress, how should he love the invisible God? <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>; nor that love which God requires of him, which is to love his neighbour as himself. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{17}</span> But whoso hath this <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> shutteth up his bowels <i>of compassion</i> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</span><p>(17) He reasons by comparisons: for if we are bound even to give our life for our neighbours, how much more are we bound to help our brothers' needs with our goods and substance?<p>(p) Wherewith this life is sustained.<p>(q) Opens not his heart to him, nor helps him willingly and cheerfully.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>. As the apostle wants to bring out that love must show itself by action, he turns his attention to the most direct evidence of it, namely, compassion towards the needy brother. “By the adversative connection (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span>) with <a href="/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a>, John marks the progress from the greater, which is justly demanded, to the less, the non-performance of which seems, therefore, a grosser transgression of the rule just stated” (Düsterdieck). According to Ebrard, the <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is meant to express the opposition to the delusion “that love can only show itself in great actions and sacrifices;” but there is no suggestion in the context of anything like this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμου</span>: “the life of the world,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> that which serves to support the earthly, worldly life; comp. <a href="/luke/8-43.htm" title="And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living on physicians, neither could be healed of any,">Luke 8:43</a>; <a href="/luke/15-12.htm" title="And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me. And he divided to them his living.">Luke 15:12</a>; <a href="/luke/21-4.htm" title="For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God: but she of her penury has cast in all the living that she had.">Luke 21:4</a>.[229] The expression forms here a significant contrast to <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ αἰώνιος</span> (<a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">θεωρεῖν</span>, stronger than <span class="greekheb">ὁρᾶν</span>, strictly “to be a spectator,” hence = <span class="ital">to look at;</span> “it expresses the active beholding” (Ebrard, similarly Myrberg: oculis immotis).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With <span class="greekheb">χρεῖαν ἔχειν</span>, comp. <a href="/mark/2-25.htm" title="And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with him?">Mark 2:25</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm" title="Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.">Ephesians 4:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression: <span class="greekheb">κλείειν τὰ σπλάγχνα</span>, is only found here; <span class="greekheb">τὰ σπγάγχνα</span> as a translation of <span class="greekheb">רַחֲמַיִם</span> appears both in the LXX. as well as often in the N. T. = <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span>; “to close the heart,” is as much as: “to forbid to compassion towards the needy brother entrance into one’s heart;” the additional <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ</span> is used in pregnant sense = “turning away from him” (Lücke, de Wette, Düsterdieck). The first two clauses might have had (not, as Baumgarten-Crusius says, “must have had”) the form of subordinate clauses; but by the fact that the form of principal clauses is given to them, the statement gains in vividness. The conclusion, which according to the sense is negative, appears as a question with <span class="greekheb">πῶς</span> (comp. chap. <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>), whereby the negation is emphatically brought out. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> is love to God, not the love of God to us (Calov).[230] Here also <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span> has the meaning noticed on <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a> (Myrberg); incorrectly Lücke: “as John is speaking of the probable absence of the previously-existing Christian life, it is put <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΙ</span></span></span> and not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΤΊ</span></span></span>.” The apostle does not want to say that the pitiless person loses again his love to God, but that it never is really in him at all. Pitilessness cannot be combined with love to God; the reason of this John states in chap. <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[229] Comp. the Greek proverb: <span class="greekheb">βίος βίου δεόμενος οὐκ ἔστι βίος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[230] Ebrard explains <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>: “the love which in its essential being took substantial form after Christ and in Christ’s loving deed” (!).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>. Love must be practical. It is easy to “lay down one’s life”: martyrdom is heroic and exhilarating; the difficulty lies in doing the little things, facing day by day the petty sacrifices and self-denials which no one notices and no one applauds. <span class="greekheb">τόν βίον τοῦ κόσμου</span>, “the livelihood of the world”; see note on <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.">1 John 2:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">θεωρῇ</span>, <span class="ital">of a moving spectacle; cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/27-55.htm" title="And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:">Matthew 27:55</a>. <span class="greekheb">κλείσῃ</span>, <span class="ital">schliesst</span>: the metaphor is locking the chamber of the heart instead of flinging it wide open and lavishing its treasures. <span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα</span>, <span class="greekheb">רַתְֽמִים</span>, <span class="ital">viscera</span>, “the inward parts,” viewed by the ancients as the seat of the affections. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a> : <span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>., “love for God” (objective genitive), inspired by and answering to the love which God feels (subjective genitive). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> note on <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">But whoso hath this world’s good</span>] Better, as R. V., <span class="ital">But whoso hath</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">world’s</span> <span class="bld">goods</span>. The ‘But’ is full of meaning. ‘But not many of us are ever called upon to die for another: smaller sacrifices, however, may be demanded of us; and what if we fail to make them?’ The word for ‘good’ or ‘goods’ (<span class="greekheb">βίος</span>) is the same as that rendered ‘life’ in <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.">1 John 2:16</a>, where see note. It signifies there and here ‘means of life, subsistence’. ‘The world’s life’, therefore, means that which supports the life of mankind, or life in this world (see on <a href="/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1 John 2:15</a>) in marked contrast to eternal life (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and seeth his brother have need</span>] Better, <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">beholdeth</span> <span class="ital">his brother</span> <span class="bld">having</span> <span class="ital">need</span>. The verb implies that he not only sees him (<span class="greekheb">ἰδεῖν</span>), but looks at him and considers him (<span class="greekheb">θεωρεῖν</span>). It is a word of which the contemplative Apostle is very fond; and outside the Synoptic Gospels and the Acts it occurs nowhere but in S. John’s writings and <a href="/hebrews/7-4.htm" title="Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.">Hebrews 7:4</a>. It is a pity to spoil the irony of the original by weakening ‘<span class="ital">having</span> need’ into ‘<span class="ital">in</span> need’ (R. V.). The one <span class="ital">has</span> as his possession the world’s <span class="ital">wealth</span>, the other <span class="ital">has</span> as his possession <span class="ital">need</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him</span>] There is no ‘of compassion’ in the Greek and we hardly need both substantives. The ancients believed the bowels to be the seat of the affections (<a href="/genesis/43-30.htm" title="And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn on his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.">Genesis 43:30</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-26.htm" title="Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king, for her bowels yearned on her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither my nor yours, but divide it.">1 Kings 3:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-20.htm" title="Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy on him, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 31:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,">Php 2:1</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-12.htm" title="Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:">Philemon 1:12</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a>) as well as the heart, whereas we take the latter only. Coverdale (here, as often, following Luther) alters Tyndale’s ‘shutteth up his compassion’ into ‘shutteth up his heart.’ And in fact, ‘shutteth up his bowels from him’ is the same as ‘closeth his heart against him.’ The phrase occurs nowhere else in N. T., but comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>. The ‘<span class="ital">from</span> him’ is picturesque, as in <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a> : it expresses the moving away and turning his back on his brother. In LXX. ‘Thou shalt not harden thine heart’ (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>) is ‘Thou shalt not <span class="ital">turn away</span> thine heart’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">how dwelleth the love of God in him?</span>] Better, as R. V., <span class="ital">how doth the love of God</span> <span class="bld">abide</span> <span class="ital">in him?</span> this preserves the order of the Greek better and marks the recurrence of S. John’s favourite verb ‘abide’ (see on <a href="/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a>). ‘The love of God’, as usual in this Epistle (see on <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a>), means man’s love to God. The question here is equivalent to the statement in <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>, that to love God and hate one’s brother is impossible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμου</span>, <span class="ital">the substance of the world</span>) An instance of the figure Litotes: in antithesis to <span class="ital">lives</span>, <a href="/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">κλείσῃ</span>, <span class="ital">shall shut</span>) whether asked for aid, or not asked.
