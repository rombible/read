They would receive it, if good for them. And as good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, so good-will to men, particularly to the brethren, must be in the hearts of those who go to God and heaven. He who thus follows Christ, dwells in Him as his ark, refuge, and rest, and in the Father through him. This union between Christ and the souls of believers, is by the Spirit he has given them. A man may believe that God is gracious before he knows it; yet when faith has laid hold on the promises, it sets reason to work. This Spirit of God works a change; in all true Christians it changes from the power of Satan to the power of God. Consider, believer, how it changes thy heart. Dost not thou long for peace with God? Wouldst thou not forego all the world for it? No profit, pleasure, or preferment shall hinder thee from following Christ. This salvation is built upon Divine testimony, even the Spirit of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he that keepeth his commandments ... - See the notes at <a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>.<p>And hereby we know that he abideth in us - That is, this is another certain evidence that we are true Christians. The Saviour had promised <a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a> that he would come and take up his abode with his people. John says that we have proof that he does this by the Spirit which he has given us. That is, the Holy Spirit is imparted to his people to enlighten their minds; to elevate their affections; to sustain them in times of trial; to quicken them in the performance of duty; and to imbue them with the temper and spirit of the Lord Jesus. When these effects exist, we may be certain that the Spirit of God is with us; for these are the "fruits" of that Spirit, or these are the effects which he produces in the lives of men. Compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. On the evidence of piety here referred to, see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>, <a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>. No man can be a true Christian in whom that Spirit does not constantly dwell, or to whom he is not "given." And yet no one can determine that the Spirit dwells in him, except by the "effects" produced in his heart and life. In the following chapter, the apostle pursues the subject suggested here, and shows that we should examine ourselves closely, to see whether the "Spirit" to which we trust, as furnishing evidence of piety, is truly the Spirit of God, or is a spirit of delusion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. dwelleth in him&#8212;The believer dwelleth in Christ.<p>and he in him&#8212;Christ in the believer.

The change of the prepositions <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> is certainly strange, but does not render this interpretation “<span class="ital">impossible</span>” (Ebrard); for, on the one hand, the form: “<span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν</span>,” is too familiar to the apostle not to have suggested itself to him here; and, on the other hand, by <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> is indicated as <span class="ital">the source</span> from which that <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span> flows; besides, the construction with <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> appears also in chap. <a href="/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us.

If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a>). “Let God be a home to thee, and be thou a home of God” (Bede).

As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me....">John 15:4-5</a>. S. John once more insists on what may be regarded as the main theme of this exposition of Christian Ethics; that <span class="ital">conduct</span> is not only not a matter of indifference, but is all-important. We may possess many kinds of enlightenment, intellectual and spiritual; but there is no union with God, and indeed no true knowledge of Him, without <span class="ital">obedience</span>: comp. <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>, <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>, <a href="/context/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him....">1 John 3:6-7</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1 John 3:9</a>. ‘He that <span class="ital">willeth to do His will</span> shall know’ (<a href="/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and hereby</span>] Or, <span class="ital">and herein</span>, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1 John 3:19</a></span>, <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a>, <a href="/context/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him....">1 John 4:9-10</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-13.htm" title="Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.">1 John 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-2.htm" title="By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.">1 John 5:2</a>. This probably refers to what follows; but the change of preposition in the Greek, a change obliterated in both A. V. and R. V., renders this not quite certain. S. John writes, not ‘here<span class="ital">by</span> we know … <span class="ital">by</span> the Spirit’ (which would place the connexion beyond a doubt), but ‘here<span class="ital">in</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>) we know … <span class="ital">from</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>) the Spirit’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we know</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">we come to know</span>; it is a matter of Christian experience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the Spirit</span>] Better, <span class="bld">from</span> <span class="ital">the Spirit</span>: this is the source from which the knowledge is derived. This is the first mention of the Spirit in the Epistle, although He is alluded to in <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which he hath given us</span>] Or, <span class="ital">which He</span> <span class="bld">gave</span> <span class="ital">us</span>. The verb is aorist, not perfect; and though this is a case where the English perfect might represent the Greek aorist, yet as the Apostle probably refers to the definite occasion when the Spirit was given, the aorist seems better. This occasion in S. John’s case would be Pentecost, in that of his readers, their baptism. Thus in our Baptismal Service we are exhorted to pray that the child “may be baptized with water and the Holy Ghost”; and in what follows we pray, “wash him and sanctify him with the Holy Ghost”; and again, “give Thy Holy Spirit to this infant, that he may be born again”: after which follows the baptism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It would be possible to translate ‘by the Spirit <span class="ital">of</span> which He has given us’, a partitive genitive, meaning ‘<span class="ital">some</span> of which’ as in <span class="ital">Macbeth</span>, I. iii. 80,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The earth hath bubbles as the water has,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And these are <span class="ital">of them</span>”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And in Bacon’s Essays, <span class="ital">Of Atheisme</span>, “You shall have <span class="ital">of them</span>, that will suffer for Atheisme, and not recant”. But the Greek genitive here is probably not partitive but the result of attraction. S. John commonly inserts a preposition (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>) with the partitive genitive (<a href="/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2 John 1:4</a>; <a href="/john/1-24.htm" title="And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.">John 1:24</a>; <a href="/john/7-40.htm" title="Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.">John 7:40</a>; <a href="/john/16-17.htm" title="Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?">John 16:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-9.htm" title="And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.">Revelation 11:9</a>; comp. <a href="/john/21-10.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught.">John 21:10</a>). Tyndale here translates ‘Therby we knowe that ther abydeth in us <span class="ital">of</span> the sprete which He gave us’, making ‘of the Spirit’ (= a portion of the Spirit) the nominative to ‘abideth’; which is grammatically possible, but scarcely in harmony with what precedes. The change from Tyndale’s rendering to the one adopted in A. V., and (with change of ‘hath given’ to ‘gave’) in R. V. also, is due to Coverdale.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Once more (see note between <a href="/context/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming....">1 John 2:28-29</a> and on <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>) we are led to a fresh section almost without knowing it. In the last six verses of this chapter (19–24) the transition from verse to verse is perfectly smooth and natural; so also in the previous six verses (13–18). Nor is the transition from <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1 John 3:18</a></span> to <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1 John 3:19</a></span> at all violent or abrupt. By a very gradual movement we have been brought from the contrast between love and hate to the gift of the Spirit. And this prepares the way for a new subject; or rather for an old subject treated from a new point of view. Like the doublings of the Maeander near which he lived, the progress of the Apostle at times looks more like retrogression than advance: but the progress is unmistakable when the whole field is surveyed. Here we seem to be simply going back to the subject of the antichrists (<a href="/context/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time....">1 John 2:18-28</a>); but whereas there the opposition between the Holy Spirit in true believers and the lying spirit in the antichrists is only suggested (<a href="/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1 John 2:22</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>), here it is the dominant idea.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-24.htm" title="And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.">1 John 3:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐκ τοῦ Πνεύματος</span>, <span class="ital">from</span> or <span class="ital">by the Spirit</span>) This is the first mention of the Holy <span class="ital">Spirit</span> in this Epistle, in accordance with the Divine economy here, as also in the Gospel of John, <a href="/context/john/14-1.htm" title="Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me....">John 14:1-3</a>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>. And in this verse there is a kind of transition to the discussion respecting the Holy Spirit, which follows immediately in the beginning of ch. 4. It is given to us <span class="ital">by</span> the Spirit, and it is the Spirit which is given.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - We are again in doubt as to whether <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> refer to God the Father or to Christ. The former seems better on account of verse 22; but the latter may be right (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).

Hitherto St. John has mentioned only the Father and the Son; now the Spirit also (alluded to in <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20, 27</a>) is introduced by name as a witness and test of the truth. The sentence forms the transition to the subject of the next section (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-6</a>), which is a sort of digression, the subject of love being mentioned in verse 7. This verse is said to have been a favourite with Spinoza. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Abideth in Him and He in Him<p>"Therefore let God be a home to thee, and be thou the home of God: abide in God, and let God abide in thee" (Bede).<p>Spirit<p>The first mention of the Spirit in the Epistle.
