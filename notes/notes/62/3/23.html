They would receive it, if good for them. And as good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, so good-will to men, particularly to the brethren, must be in the hearts of those who go to God and heaven. He who thus follows Christ, dwells in Him as his ark, refuge, and rest, and in the Father through him. This union between Christ and the souls of believers, is by the Spirit he has given them. A man may believe that God is gracious before he knows it; yet when faith has laid hold on the promises, it sets reason to work. This Spirit of God works a change; in all true Christians it changes from the power of Satan to the power of God. Consider, believer, how it changes thy heart. Dost not thou long for peace with God? Wouldst thou not forego all the world for it? No profit, pleasure, or preferment shall hinder thee from following Christ.

Having mentioned the keeping of the commandments of God, the apostle proceeds to show what they are; that they are faith in Christ, and love to one another; which two are reduced to one, because they are inseparable; where the one is, the other is; faith works by love. <p>That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ; Christ is the object of faith, and he is no, as he is Jesus, a Saviour; faith deals with him as such, and will have no other Saviour but he: and now to believe in him, is not merely to believe that he is the Son of God, the true Messiah, the Saviour of the world, that he is come in the flesh, has suffered, and died, and rose again from the dead, is ascended into heaven, and is set down at the right hand of God, makes intercession for his people, and will come again to judge the quick and dead; but it is to go forth in special and spiritual acts upon him, such as looking at him, coming to him, venturing on him, trusting in him for life and salvation, committing all into his hands, and expecting all from him. And this is called a "commandment", and comes under the notion of one; not that it is properly a law, or belongs to the law; for faith in Christ Jesus is a fruit of electing grace, and a blessing of the covenant of grace; it is the free gift of God, and the operation of his Spirit, and is peculiar to the elect of God, and sheep of Christ; and so cannot belong to the law of works; but, as the Hebrew words,  and  both signify any doctrine, and instruction in general; see <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>; so the word here used designs an evangelical doctrine, a divine instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the Gospel, which declares that he that believes in Christ shall be saved; and so the word is used for a doctrine in this epistle, <a href="/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7</a>; and that of the next command or doctrine, which follows, <p>and love one another as he gave us commandment; that is, as Christ taught and instructed his disciples, <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a>. With this verse, which—as the statement of the substance of God’s commandments—is most closely connected with the preceding, begins a new leading section, indeed the last in the Epistle, inasmuch as in <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πιστεύσωμεν τῷ ὀνόματι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. a new element of the development of ideas appears, by which the sequel is not merely “prepared for” (Ebrard), but is dominated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καί</span> is not explicative, but simply copulative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὕτη</span> refers to the following <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, which here also does not merely state the <span class="ital">purpose</span> (Braune), but the <span class="ital">substance.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐντολὴ αὐτοῦ</span>] The singular is used, because the manifold commandments in their inner nature form one unity: this is especially true of the two commandments of faith and love, here mentioned. From the fact that <span class="ital">faith</span> is described as an <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span>, it must not be inferred that it is not a work of God in man, but it certainly follows that neither can it be accomplished without the self-activity of man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The phrase <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ υἱοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. only appears here; in chap. <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a> the preposition <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is used instead of the dative; so also in <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>; <a href="/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.">John 3:18</a>, etc.; by the dative the <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα</span> of Christ is indicated as the object of devoted, believing trust;[249] “to believe on the name of Christ” is, however, identical with “to believe on Christ,” inasmuch as in the name the nature of Him who is spoken of is expressed; comp. Meyer on <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>. Grotius quite erroneously: propter Christum sive Christo auctore Deo credere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>While faith is the fundamental condition of the Christian life, brotherly love is the active proof of the living character of the faith; the two things cannot be separated from one another; hence it follows here: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἈΓΑΠῶΜΕΝ ἈΛΛΉΛΟΥς</span></span></span>,[250] which as the effect is distinguished from <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> as the cause; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> is therefore copulative and not epexegetical (as Frommann thinks, p. 591).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The subordinate clause: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘῺς ἜΔΩΚΕΝ ἘΝΤΟΛῊΝ ἩΜῖΝ</span></span></span>, is best referred to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΠῶΜΕΝ ἈΛΛΉΛΟΥς</span></span></span>, inasmuch as it is not <span class="ital">God</span> (Estius, Bengel, Sander) but Christ that is to be regarded as the subject; by <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> (“in proportion as”) the <span class="ital">quality</span> of love is indicated: it must correspond to the commandment of Christ; Myrberg: Non modo amandum est, sed etiam vere et recte amandum.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[249] Weiss has been at pains to show that <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> in John does not include the clement of trust; in this, however, he is wrong, because even where the element of <span class="ital">conviction</span> prevails in the use of the word, this must not be identified with the theoretical belief, which is a mere act of the understanding, but it includes as an essential element the immediate trust of the words or of the person to which the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> refers; in the phrase: <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>., the ethical meaning of the verb is so much the more to be recognised, as the denial of it necessitates also a weakening of the idea <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[250] Frommann (p. 200) wrongly concludes from this passage and <a href="/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-19.htm" title="We love him, because he first loved us.">1 John 4:19</a>, in which the obligation to love is expressed, that being born of God is conditioned by love, as the free act of man, “by which He keeps His independent personality and freedom towards God” (!), nay, even is <span class="ital">produced</span> by it (p. 205).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> our Lord’s summary of the commandments in <a href="/context/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together....">Matthew 22:34-40</a> = <a href="/context/mark/12-28.htm" title="And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?...">Mark 12:28-31</a>, and observe the apostolic narrowing of <span class="greekheb">τὸν πλησίον σου</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/luke/10-29.htm" title="But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?...">Luke 10:29-37</a>) to <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">τούς ἀδελφούς</span> (see note on <a href="/1_john/2-9.htm" title="He that said he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.">1 John 2:9</a>). <span class="greekheb">τῷ ὀνόματι</span>, see note on <a href="/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1 John 2:12</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">And this is his commandment</span>] Or, <span class="ital">And His commandment is this</span>; see on <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>. Here the singular is right: the various commandments, especially the two here named, faith and love, are summed up as one whole. This verse is the answer to those who would argue from the preceding verses that all that is required of us is to <span class="ital">do</span> what is right; it does not much matter what we <span class="ital">believe</span>. Not so says the Apostle. In order to do what is right it is necessary to believe: this is the first step in our obedience to God’s commands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that we should believe</span>] For ‘that’ (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>) see on <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a> : here perhaps it merely “gives the nature and contents of the commandment, not the aim” (Jelf).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ</span>] More accurately, <span class="ital">believe the Name of &c.</span> It is not the precise phrase used <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1 John 5:13</a>, <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>; <a href="/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.">John 3:18</a> (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα</span>), a construction of which S. John is very fond, but a phrase which occurs nowhere else in N. T. (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν τῷ ὀνόματι</span>), a construction similar to that in <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1 John 4:1</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-10.htm" title="He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.">1 John 5:10</a>. The former is the stronger expression, marking the more permanent trust and repose; but in such a phrase as this there cannot be much difference between ‘believing’ and ‘believing on’. ‘To believe His Name’ means to believe all that His Name (here given with solemn fulness) signifies and implies; His Divinity, His Sonship, and His office as Mediator, Advocate and Saviour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and love one another</span>] ‘Faith if it have not works is dead’ (<a href="/james/2-17.htm" title="Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone.">James 2:17</a>): hence the necessity for adding ‘and love one another’, which of course means love ‘in <span class="ital">deed</span> and truth’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1 John 3:18</a></span>). ‘And’ here is not epexegetic: it adds something fresh, giving active love as the necessary effect of living faith. ‘Love’ is in the present tense of what must be continual.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as he gave us commandment</span>] Or <span class="bld">even</span> <span class="ital">as</span> (to mark the difference between <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>). ‘He gave’ refers to Christ, just mentioned; and this limits ‘commandment’ to ‘love one another’ (<a href="/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12</a>; <a href="/john/15-17.htm" title="These things I command you, that you love one another.">John 15:17</a>): moreover love rather than faith is the subject of this portion of the Epistle. ‘To give commandment’ is a phrase which in N.

We can believe a document (<a href="/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>; <a href="/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>), or a statement (<a href="/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>; <a href="/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>), or a person (<a href="/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37, 38</a>); but how can we believe a name? By believing those truths which the name implies: in the present case by believing that Jesus is the Saviour, is the Messiah, is the Son of God. To produce this belief and its consequence, eternal life, is the purpose of St. John's Gospel (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>); it is also the will of God (<a href="/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>), and the command of his Son (<a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>). This belief will inevitably produce as its fruit that we "love one another [present tense of what is habitual], even as Christ gave us commandment" (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12, 17</a>). Throughout the Epistle, and especially in this passage (verses 22-24), the references to Christ's farewell discourses in the Gospel are frequent. Here the main ideas of those discourses are represented - obedience to the Divine commands, particularly as to faith and love; promised answer to prayer, abiding in God; the gift of the Spirit (see on 1 John 4:5). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Believe on the name (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; see on <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>. </body></html>
