The real Christian has seen his guilt and misery, and his need of such a Saviour. He has seen the suitableness of such a Saviour to all his spiritual wants and circumstances. He has found and felt the power of the word and doctrine of Christ, humbling, healing, quickening, and comforting his soul. He has a new disposition, and new delights, and is not the man that he formerly was. Yet he finds still a conflict with himself, with sin, with the flesh, the world, and wicked powers. But he finds such strength from faith in Christ, that he can overcome the world, and travel on towards a better. Such assurance has the gospel believer: he has a witness in himself, which puts the matter out of doubt with him, except in hours of darkness or conflict; but he cannot be argued out of his belief in the leading truths of the gospel. Here is what makes the unbeliever's sin so awful; the sin of unbelief. He gives God the lie; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son. It is in vain for a man to plead that he believes the testimony of God in other things, while he rejects it in this. He that refuses to trust and honour Christ as the Son of God, who disdains to submit to his teaching as Prophet, to rely on his atonement and intercession as High Priest, or to obey him as King, is dead in sin, under condemnation; nor will any outward morality, learning, forms, notions, or confidences avail him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And this is the record - This is the sum, or the amount, of the testimony (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  marturia) which God has given respecting him.<p>That God hath given to us eternal life - Has provided, through the Saviour, the means of obtaining eternal life.

So <a href="/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a> : "We should love one another as He gave (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) us commandment." <a href="/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a> : "We know that He abideth in us by the Spirit which He gave (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) us." On the other hand, <a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a> : "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) upon us." The gift of love abides in the fact that we are now children of God (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>).<p>Eternal life (&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Compare the phrase &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; the life, the eternal life (<a href="/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>), and &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768; the eternal life (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).
