The same Holy Spirit that taught the love, will have taught obedience also; and that man cannot truly love the children of God, who, by habit, commits sin or neglects known duty. As God's commands are holy, just, and good rules of liberty and happiness, so those who are born of God and love him, do not count them grievous, but lament that they cannot serve him more perfectly. Self-denial is required, but true Christians have a principle which carries them above all hinderances. Though the conflict often is sharp, and the regenerate may be cast down, yet he will rise up and renew his combat with resolution. But all, except believers in Christ, are enslaved in some respect or other, to the customs, opinions, or interests of the world. Faith is the cause of victory, the means, the instrument, the spiritual armour by which we overcome. In and by faith we cleave to Christ, in contempt of, and in opposition to the world. Faith sanctifies the heart, and purifies it from those sensual lusts by which the world obtains sway and dominion over souls. It has the indwelling Spirit of grace, which is greater than he who dwells in the world. The real Christian overcomes the world by faith; he sees, in and by the life and conduct of the Lord Jesus on earth, that this world is to be renounced and overcome. He cannot be satisfied with this world, but looks beyond it, and is still tending, striving, and pressing toward heaven. We must all, after Christ's example, overcome the world, or it will overcome us to our ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments - This constitutes true love; this furnishes the evidence of it.<p>And his commandments are not grievous - Greek, "heavy" -  &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  bareiai; that is, difficult to be borne as a burden. See <a href="/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>. The meaning is, that his laws are not unreasonable; the duties which he requires are not beyond our ability; his government is not oppressive. It is easy to obey God when the heart is right; and those who endeavor in sincerity to keep his commandments do not complain that they are hard. All complaints of this kind come from those who are not disposed to keep his commandments. Indeed, they object that his laws are unreasonable; that they impose improper restraints; that they are not easily complied with; and that the divine government is one of severity and injustice. But no such complaints come from true Christians. They find his service easier than the service of sin, and the laws of God more mild and easy to be complied with than were those of fashion and honor, which they once endeavored to obey. The service of God is freedom; the service of the world is bondage. No man ever yet heard a true Christian say that the laws of God, requiring him to lead a holy life, were stern and "grievous." But who has not felt this in regard to the inexorable laws of sin? What votary of the world would not say this if he spoke his real sentiments?

It is "the way of the transgressor" that "is hard." What makes them to the regenerate "not grievous," is faith which "overcometh the world" (1Jo 5:4): in proportion as faith is strong, the grievousness of God's commandments to the rebellious flesh is overcome. The reason why believers feel any degree of irksomeness in God's commandments is, they do not realize fully by faith the privileges of their spiritual life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For this is the love of God, </span> i.e. this is the most lively, certain expression and effect of our love to God, our keeping his commandments, which are so little grievous, that true love can make no difficulty of doing so, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/11-30.htm" title="For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.">Matthew 11:30</a> <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm" title="Moreover by them is your servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.">Psalm 19:11</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_john/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,.... Keeping of the commandments of God is an evidence of love to God; this shows that love is not in word and tongue, in profession only, but in deed and in truth; and that such persons have a sense of the love of God upon their souls, under the influence of which they act; and such shall have, and may expect to have, greater manifestations of the love of God unto them: <p>and his commandments are not grievous; heavy, burdensome, and disagreeable; by which are meant, not so much the precepts of the moral law, which through the weakness of the flesh are hard to be kept, and cannot be perfectly fulfilled; though believers indeed, being freed from the rigorous exaction, curse, and condemnation of the law, delight in it after the inward man, and serve it cheerfully with their spirit; and still less the commands of the ceremonial law, which were now abolished, and were grievous to be borne; but rather those of faith in Christ, and love to the saints, <a href="/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a>; or it may be the ordinances of the Gospel, baptism, and the Lord's supper, with others, which though disagreeable to unregenerate persons, who do not care to be under the yoke of Christ, however easy and light it is, yet are not heavy and burdensome to regenerate ones; and especially when they have the love of God shed abroad in them, the presence of God with them, communion with Jesus Christ, and a supply of grace and strength from him; then are these ways ways of pleasantness, and paths of peace, and the tabernacles of the Lord are amiable and lovely. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: <span class="cverse3">{4}</span> and his commandments are not <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> grievous.</span><p>(3) The reason: to love God, is to keep his commandments, which being so, and seeing that both the loves are commanded by the same lawmaker, (as he taught before) it follows also, that we do not love our neighbours, when we break God's commandments.<p>(4) Because experience teaches us that there is no ability in our flesh, neither will to perform God's commandments, therefore lest the apostle should seem, by so often putting them in mind of the keeping of the commandments of God, to require things that are impossible, he pronounces that the commandments of God are not in any way grievous or burdensome, that we can be oppressed with the burden of them.<p>(d) To those who are regenerate, that is to say, born again, who are led by the Spirit of God, and are through grace delivered from the curse of the law.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_john/5-3.htm" title="For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.">1 John 5:3</a> refers to the last two ideas, which were simply mentioned co-ordinatively, and expresses their unity: <span class="greekheb">αὕτη γάρ ἐστιν ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>] <span class="greekheb">αὕτη</span> is explained by the following <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span> is to be kept in its proper meaning, though <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> follows; the paraphrase: “it brings this with it, it includes the endeavour” (de Wette), weakens the thought; <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> states the import of the <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, to the realization of which it is directed.
