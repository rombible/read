but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1John 5:18</a>).<p>St. John refers back to “that ye may know” in <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.">1John 5:13</a>, and sums up three points from former portions of the Epistle, describing the true consciousness of the Christian. Each begins with “We know.”<p>(18) <span class= "bld">Sinneth not.</span>—There is no reason to supply “unto death.” (Comp. the Note on <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1John 3:9</a>.) St. John means strongly to insist, in this the solemn close of his Letter, that the true ideal Christian frame is the absence of wilful sin. Stumbles there may be, even such as need the prayers of friends, but intentional lawlessness there cannot be.<p><span class= "bld">But he that is begotten of God keepeth himself.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">he that is begotten of God keepeth him</span>: that is, the Son of God preserves him. (Comp. <a href="/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39</a>; <a href="/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a>; <a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>; <a href="/john/17-15.htm" title="I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.">John 17:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And that wicked one toucheth him not.</span>—The last mention of the devil was in <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1John 3:10</a>. The devil and his angels attack, but cannot influence so long as the Christian abides in Christ. (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm" title="Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.">Revelation 3:10</a>.)<p>(3 b.) <span class= "ital">Personal assurance that we are God’s sons</span> (<a href="/1_john/5-19.htm" title="And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.">1John 5:19</a>).<p>Next after the cardinal point that righteousness is the characteristic of the new birth comes the necessity that the Christian should make up his mind that he has been, or is being, born again, and is really different from the world. The proofs would be seen in <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1John 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1John 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1John 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1John 2:29</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1John 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-14.htm" title="We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers.

The greatest fact of all to St. John’s mind is that his Friend and Master of sixty years ago was the very Word made flesh.

Amid all the deceptions and fluctuations of the world, St. John felt, with the most absolute and penetrating and thankful conviction, that the followers of Christ were rooted and grounded in perfect, unshakable, unassailable truth. This could not be unless they were resting on the living Son and holding fast to Him.<p><span class= "bld">This is the true God, and eternal life.</span>—A most solemn and emphatic crown to the whole Epistle. “This God, <span class= "ital">as seen in His Son, </span>is the true God.” If the Word had not been God, God could not have been seen in Him. “And God, seen in His Son, is eternal life.” This is only another way of putting <a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>. (Comp. <a href="/context/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1John 5:11-13</a>.) To make “this is the true God” refer only to the Son is equally admissible by grammar, but hardly suits the argument so well.<p>(4) LAST WARNING (<a href="/1_john/5-21.htm" title="Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.">1John 5:21</a>).<p>(21) <span class= "bld">Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</span>—This parting word is suggested by the thought of “the true God.” Every scheme of thought, every object of affection, which is not of Him, is a rival of His empire, a false god, a delusive appearance only, without solidity or truth. We cannot conclude better than in the words of Ebrard: “This idea is a general and very comprehensive one: it embraces all things and everything which may be opposed to the God revealed in Christ and to His worship in spirit and in truth. Pre-eminently, therefore, it embraces the delusive and vain idols of the Corinthian Gnosticism, whether ancient or modern; but it includes also the idols and false mediators of superstition, to whom the confidence is transferred which is due only to God in Christ—be their name Madonna, or saints, or Pope, or priesthood, or good works, or pictures, or office, or church, or sacraments. The One Being in whom we have ‘the life eternal’ is <span class= "ital">Christ. . . .</span> And this Christ we possess through the <span class= "ital">Spirit of God, </span>whose marks and tokens are not priestly vestments, but faith and love. In this meaning, the Apostle’s cry sounds forth through all the ages, in the ears of all Christians, ‘LITTLE CHILDREN, KEEP YOURSELVES FROM IDOLS!’ The holiest things may become a snare if their letter is regarded and not their spirit. Every Christian Church has a tendency to worship its own brazen serpents. Happy are they who have a Hezekiah to call them Nehushtan!”<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/1_john/5.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>1 John<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I.-TRIUMPHANT CERTAINTIES</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1 John 5:18</a>John closes his letter with a series of triumphant certainties, which he considers as certified to every Christian by his own experience. ‘We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not . . . we know that we are of God . . . and we know that the Son of God is come.’ Now, that knowledge which he thus follows out on these three lines is not merely an intellectual conviction, but it is the outcome of life, and the broad seal of experimental possession is stamped upon it. Yet the average Christian reads this text, and shrugs his shoulders and says, ‘Well! perhaps I do not understand it, but, so far as I do, it seems to me to say a thing which is contradicted by the whole experience of life.’ ‘We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not’; and some of us are driven by such words, and parallel ones which occur in other places, to a presumptuous over-confidence, and some of us to an equally unscriptural despondency; and a great many of us to laying John’s triumphant certainty up upon the shelf where the unintelligible things are getting covered over with dust.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So I wish, in this sermon, to try, if I can, to come to the understanding, that in some measure I may help you to come to the joyful possession, of the truth which lies here, and which the Apostle conceives to belong to the very elements of the Christian character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. First, then, I ask the question-of whom is the Apostle speaking here?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘We know that whosoever is born of God’-or, as the Revised Version reads it, ‘begotten of God’- ‘sinneth not.’ Now we must go back a little-and sometimes to go a long way from a subject is the best way to get at it. Let me recall to you the Master’s words with which He all but began His public ministry, when He said to Nicodemus, ‘Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.’ There is the root of all that this epistle is so full of, the conception of a regeneration, a being born again, which makes men, by a new birth, sons of God, in a fashion and in a sphere of their nature in which they were not the sons of the Heavenly Father before that experience. Jesus Christ laid down, as the very first principle which He would insist upon, to a man who was groping in the midst of mere legal conceptions of righteousness as the work of his own hands, this principle,-there must be a radical change, and there must be the entrance into every human nature of a new life-principle before there is any vision, any possession of, or any entrance into, that region in which the will of God is supreme, and where He reigns and rules as King. John is only echoing his Master when he here, and in other places of this letter, lays all the stress, in regard to practical righteousness and to noble character, upon being born again, subjected to that change which is fairly paralleled with the physical fact of birth, and has, as its result, the possession by the man who passes through it of a new nature, sphered in and destined to dominate and cleanse his old self.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then there is a further step to be taken, and that is that this sonship of God, which is the result of being born again, is mediated and received by us through our faith. Remember the prologue of John’s Gospel, where, as a great musician will hint all his subsequent themes in his overture, he gathers up in one all the main threads and points of his teaching. There he says, ‘To as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.’ Long years afterwards, when an old man in Ephesus, he writes down in this last chapter of his first epistle the same truth which he there set blazing in the forefront of his Gospel when he says, in the first verse of this chapter, ‘Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.’ On condition, then, of a man’s faith in Jesus Christ, there is communicated to him a new life direct from God, kindred with the Divine, and which dwells in him, and works in him precisely in the measure of his personal faith. That is the first point that I desire to establish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>You will remember, I suppose, that this same conception of the deepest result of the Christian faith being no mere external forgiveness of sins, nor alteration of a man’s position in reference to the Divine judgments, but the communication of a new life-power and principle to him, is not the property of the mystic John only, but it is the property likewise of the legal James, who says,’ Of His own will begat He us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures’; and it is set forth with great emphasis and abundance in all the writings of the Apostle Paul, who insists that we are sons through the Son, who insists that the gift of God is a new nature, formed in righteousness ‘ after the image of Him that created Him,’ and who is ever dwelling upon the necessity that this new nature should be cultivated and increased by the faith and effort of its recipient.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Keeping these things in mind, I take the second step, and that is that this new birth, and the new Divine life which is its result, co-exist along with the old nature in which it is planted, and which it has to coerce and subdue, sometimes to crucify, and always to govern. For I need not remind you that if the analogy of birth is to be followed, we have to recognize that that Divine life, too, like the physical life, which is also God’s gift, has to pass through stages; and that just as the perfect man, God manifest in the flesh, ‘increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man,’ so the Divine life in a soul comes to it in germ, and has its period of infancy and growth up into youth and manhood. This Apostle puts great emphasis upon that idea of advancement in the Divine life. For you remember the long passage in which he twice reiterates the notion of the stages of children and young men and fathers. So the new life has to grow, grow in its own strength, grow in its sphere of influence, grow in the power with which it purges and hallows the old nature in the midst of which it is implanted. But growth is not the only word for its development. That new nature has to fight for its life. There must be effort, in order that it may rule; there must be strenuous and continuous diligence, directed not only to strengthen it, but to weaken its antagonist, in order that it may spread and permeate the whole nature. Thus we have the necessary foundation laid for that which characterizes the Christian life, from the beginning to the end, that it is a working out of that which is implanted, a working out, with ever widening area of influence, and a working in with ever deeper and more thorough power of transforming the character. There may be indefinite approximation to the entire suppression and sanctification of the old man; and whatsoever is born of God manifests its Divine kindred in this, that sooner or later it overcomes the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, if all that which I have been saying is true- and to me it is undeniably so-I come to a very plain answer to the first question that I raised: Who is it that John is speaking about? ‘Whosoever is born of God’ is the Christian man, in so far as the Divine life which he has from God by fellowship with His Son, through His own personal faith, has attained the supremacy in Him. The Divine nature that is in a man is that which is born of God. And that the Apostle does not mean the man in whom that nature is implanted, whether he is true to the nature or no, is obvious from the fact that, in another part of this same chapter, he substitutes ‘whatsoever’ for ‘whosoever,’ as if he would have us mark that the thing which he declares to be victorious and sinless is not so much the person as the power that is lodged in the person. That is ray answer to the first question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. What is asserted about this Divine life?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Whosoever is born of God sinneth not.’ That is by no means a unique expression in this letter. For, to say nothing about the general drift of it, we have a precisely similar statement in a previous chapter, twice uttered. ‘Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not’; ‘whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for His seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.’ Nothing can be stronger than that. Yes, and nothing can be more obvious. I think, then, that the Apostle does not thereby mean to declare that, unless a man is absolutely sinless in regard of his individual acts, he has not that Divine life in him. For look at what precedes our text. Just before he has said, and it is the saying which leads him to my text, ‘If any man seeth his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life.’ So, then, he contemplated that within the circle of sons of God, who were each other’s brethren because they were all possessors of that Divine birth, there would exist ‘sin not unto death,’ which demanded a brother’s brotherly intercession and help. And do you suppose that any man, in the very same breath in which he thus declared that brotherhood was to be manifested by the way in which we help a brother to get rid of his sins, would have stultified himself by a blank, staring contradiction such as has been extracted from the words of my text? I say nothing about inspiration; I only say common-sense forbids it. The fact of the matter is that John, in his simple, childlike way, does not wait to concatenate his ideas, or to show how the one limits and explains the other, but he lays them down before us, and the fact of their juxtaposition limits, and he does not expect that his readers are quite fools. So he says in the one breath, ‘If any man see his brother sin a sin,’ and in the next breath, ‘Whosoever is born of God sinneth not.’ Surely there is a way to bring these two sayings into harmony. And it seems to me to be the way that I have been suggesting to you-viz., to take the text to mean-not that a Christian is, or must be, in order to vindicate his right to be called a Christian, sinless, but that there is a power in him, a life-principle in him which is sinless, and whatsoever in him is born of God overcometh the world and’ sinneth not.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, then, that seems to me to be the extent of the Apostle’s affirmation here; and I desire to draw two plain, practical conclusions. One is, that this notion of a Divine life-power, lodged in, and growing through, and fighting with the old nature, makes the hideousness and the criminality of a Christian man’s transgressions more hideous and more criminal. The teaching of my text has sometimes been used in the very opposite direction. I do not need to say anything about that. There have been people that have said ‘It is no more I, but sin, that dwelleth in me; I am not responsible.’ There have been types of so-called Christianity which have used this loftiest and purest thought of my text as a minister of sin. I do not suppose that there are any representatives of that caricature and travesty here, so I need not say a word about it. The opposite inference is what I urge now. In addition to all the other foulnesses which attach to any man’s lust, or lechery, or drunkenness, or ambition, or covetousness, this super-eminent brand and stigma is burned in upon yours and mine, Christian men and women, that it is dead against, absolutely inconsistent with, the principle of life that is bedded within us. And whilst all men, by every transgression, flout God and degrade themselves, the Christian man who comes down to the level of living for flesh and sense and time and self, has laid the additional and heaviest of all weights of guilt upon his hack in that he has done despite to the Spirit of grace, and grieved and contradicted and thwarted the life of God that is within him. The deepest guilt and the darkest condemnation attach to the sins of the man who, with a Divine life in his spirit, obeys the flesh. ‘To whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another consideration may fairly be urged as drawn from this text and that is that the one task of Christians ought to be to deepen and to strengthen the life of God, which is in their souls, by faith. There is no limit, except one of my own making, to the extent to which my whole being may be penetrated through and through and ruled absolutely by that new life which God has given.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘‘Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Oh life, not death, for which we pant; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>More life, and better, that I want’ </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is all very well to cultivate specific and sporadic virtues and graces. Get a firmer hold and a fuller possession of the life of Christ in your own souls, and all graces and virtues will come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Now, I have one last question-what is the ground of John’s assertion about him ‘that is born of God’?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>My text runs on, ‘but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself.’ If any of you are using the Revised Version, you will see a change there, small in extent, but large in significance. It reads,’ He that is begotten of God keepeth him.’ And although at this stage of my sermon it would be absurd in me to enter upon exegetical considerations, let me just say in a sentence that the original has considerable variation in expression in these two clauses, which variation makes it impossible, I think, to adopt the idea contained in the Authorized Version, that the same person is referred to in both clauses. The difference is this. In the first clause, ‘He that is begotten of God’ is the Christian man; in the second, ‘He that is begotten of God’ is Christ the Saviour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is the guarantee that ‘ Whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not,’ because round his weakness is cast the strong defense of the Elder Brother’s hand; and the Son of God keeps all the sons who, through Him, have derived into their natures the life of God. If, then, they are kept by the only begotten Son of the Father, who, that ‘He might bring many sons unto glory,’ has Himself worn the likeness of our flesh apart from sin, then the one thing for us to do, in order to nourish and deepen and strengthen, and bring to sovereign power in our poor natures that previous and enduring principle of life, is to take care that we do not run away from the keeping hand nor wander far from the only safety. When a little child is sent out for a walk by the parent with an elder brother, if it goes staring into shop windows, and gaping at anything that it sees upon the road, and loses hold of the brother’s hand, it is lost, and breaks into tears, and can only be consoled and secured by being brought back. Then the little fingers clasp round the larger hand, and there is a sense of relief and of safety.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dear brethren, if we stray away from Christ we lose ourselves in muddy ways. If we keep near Him, as merchantmen in time of war keep near the men-of-war convoy, or as pilgrims across a dangerous desert keep close to the heels of the horses of their escort, ‘that wicked one toucheth us not.’ And so we may be sure that ‘ that which is born of God’ will come to the sovereign power within us, and He that was born of the Spirit will cast out him that was born of the flesh.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_john/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not....">1 John 5:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">We know, </span>&c. — As if he had said, Yet this gives no encouragement to sin.

Though he may fall into sin, and grieve his brethren, yet we are never to cease to pray for a true Christian: we are never to feel that he has committed the sin which has never forgiveness, and that he has thrown himself beyond the reach of our prayers. This passage, in its connection, is a full proof that a true Christian "will" never commit the unpardonable sin, and, therefore, is a proof that he will never fall from grace.

Still, in English Version reading, God's working by His Spirit inwardly, and man's working under the power of that Spirit as a responsible agent, is what often occurs elsewhere.

He that loves not his brother stays in death.">1 John 3:14</a>; comp. <a href="/context/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things....">1 John 2:20-21</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1 John 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a>): and perhaps in all cases it is meant to mark the contrast between the real knowledge of the believer, which is based upon Divine revelation in Christ, and the spurious knowledge of the Gnostic, which is based upon human intelligence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The triple ‘we know’ at the close of the Epistle confirms the view that <a href="/john/21-24.htm" title="This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.">John 21:24</a> is by the Apostle’s own hand, and not added by the Ephesian elders.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whosoever is born of God</span>] Better, as R.V., <span class="ital">whosoever is</span> <span class="bld">begotten</span> <span class="ital">of God</span>, It is the same verb, though not the same tense, as is used in the next clause: A.V. changes the verb and does not change the tense. The sentence is a return to the statement made in <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1 John 3:9</a>, where see notes. Once more the Apostle is not afraid of an apparent contradiction (see on <a href="/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1 John 2:15</a>). He has just been saying that if a Christian sins his brother will intercede for him; and now he says that the child of God does not sin. The one statement refers to possible but exceptional facts; the other to the habitual state. A child of God may sin; but his normal condition is one of resistance to sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">but</span> <span class="bld">the Begotten</span> <span class="ital">of God keepeth</span> <span class="bld">him</span>. The first change depends upon a question of interpretation, the second on one of reading; and neither can be determined with certainty. The latter is the easier question and it throws light on the former. ‘Him’ (<span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>), on the high authority of A1B and the Vulgate, seems to be rightly preferred by most editors to ‘himself’ (<span class="greekheb">ἑαυτόν</span>). This ‘him’ is the child of God spoken of in the first clause: who is it that ‘keepeth him’? Not the child of God himself, as A. V. leads us to suppose and many commentators explain, but the Son of God, the Only-Begotten. On any other interpretation S. John’s marked change of tense appears arbitrary and confusing. Recipients of the Divine birth are always spoken of by S. John both in his Gospel and in his Epistle in the <span class="ital">perfect</span> participle (<span class="greekheb">ὁ γεγεννημένος</span> or <span class="greekheb">τὸ γεγεννημένον</span>); <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1 John 3:9</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1 John 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-4.htm" title="For whatever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.">1 John 5:4</a>; <a href="/john/3-6.htm" title="That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.">John 3:6</a>; <a href="/john/3-8.htm" title="The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.">John 3:8</a>; also the first clause here. In the present clause he abruptly changes to the <span class="ital">aorist</span> participle (<span class="greekheb">ὁ γεννηθείς</span>), which he uses nowhere else (comp. <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm" title="But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-29.htm" title="But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.">Galatians 4:29</a>). The force of the two tenses here seems to be this: the perfect expresses a permanent relation begun in the past and continued in the present; the aorist expresses a timeless relation, a mere fact: the one signifies the child of God as opposed to those who have not become His children; the other signifies the Son of God as opposed to the evil one. It is some confirmation of this view that in the Constantinopolitan Creed, commonly called the Nicene Creed, ‘begotten of the Father’ (<span class="greekheb">τὸν ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς γεννηθέντα</span>) is the same form of expression as that used here for ‘begotten of God’ (<span class="greekheb">ὁ γεννηθεὶς ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>). Moreover this interpretation produces another harmony between Gospel and Epistle. Christ both directly by His power and indirectly by His intercession ‘keepeth’ the children of God: ‘I <span class="ital">kept</span> them in Thy Name’ (<a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>); ‘I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world but that Thou shouldest <span class="ital">keep them from the evil one</span>’ (<a href="/john/17-15.htm" title="I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.">John 17:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that wicked one toucheth him not</span>] Better, <span class="bld">the evil one</span> <span class="ital">toucheth him not</span>: see on <a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a> and <a href="/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.">1 John 2:13</a>. Strangely enough the Genevan Version has ‘that wycked <span class="ital">man</span>.’ The original is perhaps less strong than the English; ‘layeth not hold on him’ (<span class="greekheb">ἅπτεται</span>); see on <a href="/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>. The evil one does assault him, but he gets no hold. ‘No one shall snatch them out of My hand’ (<a href="/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a>). ‘The ruler of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in Me’ (<a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>). Therefore whoever is in Christ is safe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>18–20. The Sum of the Christian’s Knowledge<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">18–20</span>. The Epistle now draws rapidly to a close. Having briefly, yet with much new material, retouched some of the leading ideas of the Epistle, eternal life, faith in Christ and boldness in prayer united with brotherly love (13–17), the Apostle now goes on to emphasize once more three great facts about which Christians have sure knowledge, facts respecting themselves, their relations to the evil one and his kingdom, and their relations to the Son of God. Each verse is a condensation of what has been said elsewhere. <span class="ital"><a href="/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1 John 5:18</a></span> is a combination of <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1 John 3:9</a> with <a href="/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning.

Fellowship with one another is not mentioned again, but is included in the threefold ‘<span class="ital">we</span> know’.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_john/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1 John 5:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἴδαμεν</span>, <span class="ital">we know</span>) An instance of the figure Anaphora:[26] see the next verses.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι πᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">that every one</span>) Now he takes care that no one abuse, verses 16, 17, to the purpose of (carnal) security.—<span class="greekheb">γεγεννημένος</span>) Shortly afterwards <span class="greekheb">γεννηθείς</span>.

"Can we be certain of any principles in ethics? St. John declares that we can. He says that he has not been making probable guesses about the grounds of human actions, the relations of man to God, the nature of God himself. These are firings that he <span class="accented">knows.</span> Nay, he is not content with claiming this knowledge himself. He uses the plural pronoun; he declares that his disciples, his little children, <span class="accented">know</span> that which he knows" (Maurice). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We know;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2, 14</a>, and <a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>, which should be compared with this passage. These expressions of Christian certitude explain the undialectical character of St. John's Epistles as compared with those of St. Paul. What need to argue and prove when both he and his readers already knew and believed? We must have <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in both clauses, as in the Revised Version, not <span class="accented">"born"</span> in one and <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in the other, as in the Authorized Version. In the Greek there is a change of tense <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, but no change of verb. The whole should run, "We know that whosoever is <span class="cmt_word">begotten</span> of God sinneth not, but <span class="cmt_word">the Begotten</span> of God keepeth <span class="cmt_word">him</span>." For the perfect participle, comp. <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1, 4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6, 8</a>: it expresses him who has come to be, and still continues to be, a  son of God. The aorist participle occurs nowhere else in St. John: it expresses him who, without relation to time past or present, is the Son of God. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is preferable to <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">conservat eum</span>, not <span class="accented">conserver seipsum</span>, which Calvin adopts. The eternal Son of the Father preserves the frail children of the Father from the common foe, so that <span class="cmt_word">the evil one</span> toucheth them not. The verb for "touch <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is the same as in "Touch me not" (<a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). In both cases "touch" is somewhat too weak a rendering; the meaning is rather, "lay hold of," "hold fast." The Magdalene wished, not merely to touch, but to hold the Lord fast, so as to have his bodily presence continually. And here the meaning is that, though the evil one may attack the children of God, yet he cannot get them into his power. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We know (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>John uses this appeal to knowledge in two forms: we know (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); ye know (<a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>).<p>He that is begotten of God (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Lit., was begotten.
