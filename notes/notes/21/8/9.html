Observed, taken notice of, and thoroughly considered; all that is said above, concerning the scarcity of good men and women, the fall of our first parents, the excellency of wisdom, the necessity and advantage of keeping the king's commandment, the time and manner of doing it, the evil consequences that follow an inattention to these things, ignorance of what is to come, and the unavoidableness of death; <p>and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun; not so much to mechanic works and manual operations performed by men, as to moral or immoral works, and chiefly the work of Providence with respect to good and bad men, the consequence of which were the following observations; <p>there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt; or "the man ruleth over men" (h); for this is not to be understood of private rule in families, of the parent over his children, or master over his servant, but of a king over his subjects; who is the man, the principal man in the kingdom; and such a man ruling in an arbitrary and tyrannical way is to his own detriment in the issue. So Rehoboam; by his oppressive government, lost ten tribes out of twelve. Some have lost their whole kingdoms, and come to an untimely end; as well as ruined their immortal souls. Some render it "to his hurt" (i); to the hurt of those that are ruled, when it should be for their good, the protection of their persons and properties; but instead of that they lay heavy burdens upon them, take away their property, and injure and insult their persons. So the Targum, <p>"to do ill to him.'' <p>But Jarchi interprets it of the king himself. Some take it in both senses; and so it is usually in fact, that wicked princes rule to their own hurt, and the hurt of their subjects. <p>(h) "homo", Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, Junius &amp; Tremellius, &amp;c.

The English reflexive pronoun, in which our Version follows the Vulgate, misrepresents the purport of the sentence. What is described is, as before, the misrule of the tyrant-king who rules over others (the indefinite “another” standing for the plural) to <span class="bld">their</span> hurt. The wide induction had not been uniform in its results. The law of Nemesis was traversed by the law of apparent impunity. We have the “two voices” once again, and the writer passes, like Abelard in his <span class="ital">Sic et Non</span>, from affirmation to denial. The English version seems to have originated in the wish to make this verse also repeat the affirmation of the preceding. The immediate context that follows shews however that this is not now the writer’s thought, and that he is troubled by the apparent exceptions to it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this have I seen</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all that has been mentioned in the preceding eight verses, especially the conviction of retributive justice.

A new sentence is not commenced here, but the clause is closely connected with what precedes; and "his own hurt" should he "his [equivocally] hurt." Thus Wright and Volck: "All this have I seen, even by applying my heart to all the work that is done under the sun, at a time when man ruleth over man to his hurt." Most modern commentators consider that the hurt is that of the oppressed subject; but it is possible that the sense is intentionally ambiguous, and the injury may be that which the despot inflicts, and that which he has to suffer. Both these have been signified above. There is no valid reason for making, as Cox does, this last clause commence ver. 10, and rendering, "But there is a time when a man ruleth over men to their hurt." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The warning, corresponding to the exhortation, now follows: One must not thoughtlessly avoid the duty of service and homage due to the king: "Hasten not to go away from him: join not in an evil matter; for he executeth all that he desireth." Regarding the connection, of two verbs with one idea, lying before us in &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; ... &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;, as e.g., at <a href="/zechariah/8-15.htm">Zechariah 8:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/1-6.htm">Hosea 1:6</a>, vid., Gesen. 142. 3b. Instead of this sentence, we might use &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; &#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514; &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, as e.g., Aboth v. 8: "The wise man does not interrupt another, and hastens not to answer," i.e., is not too hasty in answering. As with &#1506;&#1501;, to be with the king, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:15</a>  equals  to hold with him, so here &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; means to take oneself away from him, or, as it is expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, to leave one's station; cf. <a href="/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a> : "They (the prophets of Jahve) called to them, forthwith they betook themselves away from them." It is possible that in the choice of the expression, the phrase &#1504;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; &#1502;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, "to be put into a state of alarm before any one," <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-15.htm">Job 23:15</a>, was not without influence. The indef. &#1512;&#1506; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-1.htm">Deuteronomy 17:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-10.htm">Deuteronomy 23:10</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-20.htm">Deuteronomy 19:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-41.htm">2 Kings 4:41</a>, etc., is to be referred (with Rosenm., Knobel, Bullock, and others) to undertakings which aim at resisting the will of the king, and reach their climax in conspiracy against the king's throne and life (<a href="/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a>). &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468; might mean: persist not in it; but the warning does not presuppose that the entrance thereon had already taken place, but seeks to prevent it, thus: enter not, go not, engage not, like 'amad bederek, <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; 'amad babrith, <a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a>. Also the Arab. 'amada li  equals  intendit, proposuit sibi rem, is compared; it is used in the general sense of "to make toward something, to stretch to something." Otherwise Ewald, Elst., Ginsb., and Zckl.: stand not at an evil word (of the king), provoking him to anger thereby still more, - against <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a>, where &#1512;&#1506; &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, as generally (cf. <a href="/psalms/141-4.htm">Psalm 141:4</a>), means an evil thing, and against the close connection of &#1489;&#1468; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, which is to be presupposed. Hitzig even: stand not at an evil command, i.e., hesitate not to do even that which is evil, which the king commands, with the remark that here a servilismus is introduced as speaking, who, in saying of the king, "All that pleaseth him he doeth," uses words which are used only of God the Almighty, <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>, etc. Hengst., Hahn, Dale, and others therefore dream of the heavenly King in the text. But proverbs of the earthly king, such as <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>, say the very same thing; and if the Mishna Sanhedrin ii. 2, to which Tyler refers, says of the king, "The king cannot himself be a judge, nor can any one judge him; he does not give evidence, and no evidence can be given against him," a sovereignty is thus attributed to the king, which is formulated in 3b and established in the verse following. </body></html>
