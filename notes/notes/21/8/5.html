Either the commandment of an earthly king, which should be kept, when agreeably to the laws of the nation, and not inconsistent with the commands of God; and such as do observe it "know no evil" (a), as it may be rendered, or no sorrow; they live peaceably and quietly, and enjoy the favour and protection of the government under which they are, and have praise of men; see <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3</a>; or the commandments of the heavenly King, the singular being put for the plural; so the Targum, <p>"whoso keepeth the commandments of the Lord shall know no evil in the world to come.'' <p>Nor in this world neither; no evil befalls them; what may be thought to be so is for their good; though they know and are conscious of the evil of sin, and commit it, yet not willingly, and with love to it, and so as to make it the work of their lives; but lament it, repent of it, and forsake it, and do not feel the evil of punishment for it; yea, such enjoy much good; have much communion with God; large discoveries of his love; dwell in him, and shall at last dwell with him in the heavenly city; see <a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>; <p>and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment; he knows not only what is his duty to do, both with respect to God and men, to a temporal prince or the King eternal; but he knows also the most fit and convenient time of doing it; and lays hold on every opportunity that offers, and which may be called "redeeming time", <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>; and he knows the right manner in which it should be performed, with all the agreeable circumstances of it, which he carefully observes; or he knows the judgment that will be passed, or the punishment that will be inflicted on delinquents, either by God or men; and therefore is careful to keep the commandment, and avoid it: and especially he remembers there is a judgment to come, when everything will be brought to an account; and, though he does not know the precise day and hour, yet he knows there will be such a time; so some render it, "the time of judgment" (b): the Targum is, <p>"and the time of prayer, and of judgment, and of truth, is known by the heart of the wise.'' <p>(a)  "non cognoscet", Vatablus, Mercerus, Gejerus, Rambachius, Cocceius.

If the “commandment” is that of the king, they enjoin unhesitating servile obedience as in the interpretation (3) of <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm" title="Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he does whatever pleases him.">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a>. If, according to the all but invariable use of the word in the O. T., we take it as the “commandment” of God, the meaning is in harmony with the interpretation (4) of the previous precept, and parallel with the French motto, “<span class="ital">Fais ton devoir, avienne que pourra</span>” (“Do thy duty, come what may”). Here again, it seems natural to assume an intentional ambiguity. A like doubt hangs over the words “shall feel (literally <span class="bld">know</span>) no evil thing” which may mean either “shall be anxious about no moral evil,” or more probably “shall suffer no physical evil as the penalty of moral.” Can we not imagine the writer here also with a grave irony, uttering his Delphic oracles, and leaving men to choose their interpretation, according as their character was servile or noble, moved by “the fear of the Lord,” or only by the fear of men?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment</span>] The “heart” as, for the most part, elsewhere in the Old Testament, includes the intellectual as well as the moral element in man’s nature. In the word “time” we have, as in ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm" title="To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, the <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span> or “season” on which Greek sages laid so great a stress. What is meant is that the wise man, understanding the true meaning of the previous maxim, will not be impatient under oppression, but will bide his time, and wait in patience for the working of the Divine Law of retribution. This meaning is, however, as before, partially veiled, and the sentence might seem to imply that he should let his action depend on opportunities and be a time-server in the bad sense.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing</span>. This is an encouragement to obedience to royal authority (comp. <a href="/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21, 22</a>; <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3</a>). The context plainly shows that it is not God's commandment that is spoken of (though, of course, the maxim would be very true in this case), but the king's. Nor is it necessarily a servile and unreasoning obedience that is enjoined. Koheleth is dealing with generals. Such cases as that of Daniel and the three children, where obedience would have been sinful, are not here taken into consideration. "Shall feel," literally, "shall know," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. experience no physical evil. Quiet submission to the powers that be guarantees a peaceful and happy life. Ginsburg and others translate, "knoweth not an evil word," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. is saved from abuse and reproach, which seems somewhat meager, though the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate is better, <span class="accented">Non experietur quidquam malt<span class="cmt_word"></span>. And a wise man's heart discerneth</span> (<span class="accented">knoweth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>both time and judgment.</span> The verb is the same in both clauses, and ought to have been so translated. The "heart" includes the moral as well as the intellectual faculties; and the maxim says that the wise man bears oppression and remains unexcited even in evil days, because he is convinced that there is a time of judgment coming when all will be righted (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). The certainty of retributive justice is so strong in his mind that he does not resort to rebellion in order to rectify matters, but possesses his soul in patience, leaving the correction of abuses in God's hands. Septuagint, "The wise man's heart knoweth the time of judgment," making a hendiadys of the two terms. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">tempus et responsionem</span>, "time and answer." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Behold what I have found, saith Koheleth, adding one thing to another, to find out the account: What my soul hath still sought, and I have not found, (is this): one man among a thousand have I found; and a woman among all these have I not found." It is the ascertained result, "one man, etc.," which is solemnly introduced by the words preceding. Instead of &#1488;&#1501; &#1511;&#1492;, the words &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492; are to be read, after <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>, as is now generally acknowledged; errors of transcription of a similar kind are found at <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>; <a href="/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12</a>. Ginsburg in vain disputes this, maintaining that the name Koheleth, as denoting wisdom personified, may be regarded as fem. as well as mas.; here, where the female sex is so much depreciated, was the fem. self-designation of the stern judge specially unsuitable. Hengst. supposes that Koheleth is purposely fem. in this one passage, since true wisdom, represented by Solomon, stands opposite to false philosophy. But this reason for the fem. rests on the false opinion that woman here is heresy personified; he further remarks that it is significant for this fem. personification, that there is "no writing of female authorship in the whole canon of the O.T. and N.T." But what of Deborah's triumphal song, the song of Hannah, the magnificat of Mary? We hand this absurdity over to the Clementines! The woman here was flesh and blood, but pulchra quamvis pellis est mens tamen plean procellis; and Koheleth is not incarnate wisdom, but the official name of a preacher, as in Assyr., for &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1504;&#1512;&#1501;, curators, overseers, hazana&#770;ti <p>(Note: Vid., Fried. Delitzsch's Assyr. Stud. (1874), p. 132.)<p>is used. &#1494;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>, points, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>, to what follows. &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1500;, one thing to another (cf. <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>), must have been, like summa summarum and the like, a common arithmetical and dialectical formula, which is here subordinate to &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, since an adv. inf. such as &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495; is to be supplemented: taking one thing to another to find out the &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., the balance of the account, and thus to reach a facit, a resultat.<p>(Note: Cf. Aboth iv. 29, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, "to give account;" &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;, "all according to the result.")<p>That which presented itself to him in this way now follows. It was, in relation to woman, a negative experience: "What my soul sought on and on, and I found not, (is this)." The words are like the superscription of the following result, in which finally the &#1494;&#1492; of <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a> terminates. Ginsburg, incorrectly: "what my soul is still seeking," which would have required &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;. The pret. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (with &#1511; without Dagesh, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-29.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:29</a>)<p>(Note: As generally the Piel forms of the root &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, Masor. all have Raphe on the ,&#1511; except the imper. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;; vid., Luzzatto's Gramm. 417.)<p>is retrospective; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, means redire, again and again, continually, as at Gen.. <a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>. He always anew sought, and that, as biqshah naphshi for &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497; denotes, with urgent striving, violent longing, and never found, viz., a woman such as she ought to be: a man, one of a thousand, I have found, etc. With right, the accentuation gives Garshayim to adam; it stands forth, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>, as a general denominator - the sequence of accents, Geresh, Pashta, Zakef, is as at <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>. "One among a thousand" reminds us of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23</a>, cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; the old interpreters (vid., Dachselt's Bibl. Accentuata), with reference to these parallels, connect with the one man among a thousand all kinds of incongruous christological thoughts. Only, here adam, like the Romanic l'homme and the like, means man in sexual contrast to woman. It is thus ideally meant, like ish, <a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a>, and accordingly also the parall. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;. For it is not to be supposed that the author denies thereby perfect human nature to woman. But also Burger's explanation: "a human being, whether man or woman," is a useless evasion. Man has the name adam &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;. by primitive hist. right: "for the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man," <a href="/1_corinthians/11-8.htm">1 Corinthians 11:8</a>. The meaning, besides, is not that among a thousand human beings he found one upright man, but not a good woman (Hitz.), - for then the thousand ought to have had its proper denominator, &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, - but that among a thousand persons of the male sex he found only one man such as he ought to be, and among a thousand of the female sex not one woman such as she ought to be; "among all these" is thus  equals  among an equal number. Since he thus actually found the ideal of man only seldom, and that of woman still seldomer (for more than this is not denoted by the round numbers), the more surely does he resign himself to the following resultat, which he introduces by the word &#1500;&#1489;&#1491; (only, alone), as the clear gain of his searching: </body></html>
