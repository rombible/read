Such a flight the Teacher looks on as an act of impatient unwisdom. It is better to bear the yoke, than to seek an unattainable independence. So those who have grown grey in politics warn younger and more impetuous men against the folly of a premature resignation of their office.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">stand not in an evil thing</span>] The Hebrew noun (as so often elsewhere) may mean either “word” or “thing:” the verb may mean “standing” either in the attitude (1) of persistence, or (2) protest, or (3) of hesitation, or (4) of obedient compliance. Hence we get as possible renderings, (1) “Persist not in an evil thing;” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in conspiracies against the king’s life or power. (2) Protest not against an evil (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> angry) word. (3) Stand not, hesitate not, at an evil thing, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> comply with the king’s commands however unrighteous. (4) Obey not in an evil thing, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> obey, but let the higher law of conscience limit thy obedience. Of these (1) seems most in harmony with the context, and with O. T. usage as in <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm" title="Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.">Psalm 1:1</a>. Perhaps, however, after the manner of an enigmatic oracle, not without a touch of irony, requiring the discernment of a wise interpreter, there is an intentional ambiguity, allowing the reader if he likes, to adopt (3) or (4) and so acting as a test of character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him</span>] The words paint a sovereignty such as Greek poets loved to hold up for men’s abhorence,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλλ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἡ τυραννὶς πολλά τ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἄλλ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἐυδαιμονεῖ</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κἄξεστιν αὐτῇ δρᾶν λέγειν δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἂ βούλεται</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“The tyrant’s might in much besides excels,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And it may do and say whate’er it wills.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Soph. <span class="ital">Antig</span>. 507.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here also we have an echo of the prudential counsel of Epicurus, who deliberately preferred a despotic to a democratic government (Sen. <span class="ital">Ep.</span> xxix. 10), and laid it down as a rule, that the wise man should at every opportune season court the favour of the monarch (<span class="greekheb">καὶ μόναρχον ἐν καιρῷ θεραπεύσει</span>), Diog.

Do not, from some hasty impulse, or induced by harsh treatment, cast off your allegiance to your liege lord. We have the phrase, "go away," in the sense of quitting of service or desertion of a duty, in <a href="/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>. So St. Peter urges servants to be subject unto their masters, "not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward" (<a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). Solomon might have given this advice to the Israelites who were ready to follow Jeroboam's lead; though they could have remained loyal to Rehoboam only from high religious motives. But it is better to bear even a heavy yoke than to rebel. The Septuagint has, "Be not hasty; thou shalt go from his presence" - which seems to mean, "Be not impatient, and all will be well." But the authorized rendering is correct (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>). We may quote Mendelssohn's comment cited by Chance on <a href="/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a>, "This is a great rule in politics, that the people must have no power to pronounce judgment upon the conduct of a king, whether it be good or bad; for the king judges the people, and not the reverse; and if it were not for this rule, the country would never be quiet, and without rebels against the king and his law." <span class="cmt_word">Stand not in an evil thing</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque permaneas in opere malo</span>, "Persist not in an evil affair." But the verb here implies rather the engaging in a matter than continuing an undertaking already begun. The "affair" is conspiracy, insurrection; and Koheleth warns against entering upon and taking part in any such attempt. This seems to be the correct explanation of the clause; but it is, perhaps intentionally, ambiguous, and is capable of other interpretations. Thus Ginsburg, "Do not stand up (in a passion) because of an evil word." Others, "Obey not a sinful command," or "Hesitate not at an evil thing," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. if the king orders it. Wordsworth, referring to <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. renders, "Stand not in the way of sinners," which seems to be unsuitable to the context. The Septuagint gives, "Stand not in an evil word" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>, perhaps "matter"). The reason for the injunction follows. <span class="cmt_word">For he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</span> The irresponsible power of a despotic monarch is here signified, though the terms are applicable (as some, indeed, take them as alone appertaining) to God himself (but see <a href="/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>). The Septuagint combines with this clause the commencement of the following verse, "For he will do whatsover he pleases, even as a king using authority (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)."

Jebamoth 63b.)<p>the particip. clause stands frequently thus, not only as a circumstantial clause, <a href="/genesis/14-12.htm">Genesis 14:12</a>., but also as principal clause, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>, in an historical connection. The preceding pred. &#1502;&#1512;, in the mas. ground-form, follows the rule, Gesen. 147. Regarding the construction of the relative clause, Hitzig judges quite correctly: "&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; is copula between subj. and pred., and precedes for the sake of the contrast, giving emphasis to the pred. It cannot be a nomin., which would be taken up by the suff. in &#1500;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, since if this latter were subject also to &#1502;&#1509;, &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; would not certainly be found. Also asher here is not a conj." This &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;), which in relative substantival clauses represents the copula, for the most part stands separated from asher, e.g., <a href="/genesis/7-2.htm">Genesis 7:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/17-5.htm">Numbers 17:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a>; less frequently immediately with it, <a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-26.htm">Leviticus 11:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>. But this asher hu (hi) never represents the subj., placed foremost and again resumed by the reflex. pronoun, so as to be construed as the accentuation requires: quae quidem retia et laquei cor ejus  equals  cajus quidem cor sunt retia et laquei (Heiligst.). &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491; is the means of searching, i.e., either of hunting: hunting-net (mitsodah, <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>), or of blockading: siege-work, bulwarks, <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:14</a>; here it is the plur. of the word in the former meaning. &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-14.htm">Habakkuk 1:14</a>, plur. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-5.htm">Ezekiel 26:5</a>, etc. (perhaps from &#1495;&#1512;&#1501;, to pierce, bore through), is one of the many synon. for fishing-net. &#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, fetters, the hands (arms) of voluptuous embrace. The primary form, after <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a>, is &#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, &#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;; cf. &#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;, &#1488;&#1489;, <a href="/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9</a>. Of the three clauses following asher, vav is found in the second and is wanting to the third, as at <a href="/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>; <a href="/job/42-9.htm">Job 42:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>; cf. on the other hand, <a href="/isaiah/33-6.htm">Isaiah 33:6</a>. Similar in their import are these Leonine verses:<p>Femina praeclara facie quasi pestis amara,<p>Et quasi fermentum corrumpit cor sapientum.<p>That the author is in full earnest in this harsh judgment regarding woman, is shown by 26b: he who appears to God as good (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>) escapes from her (the fut. of the consequence of this his relation to God); but the sinner (&#1495;&#1493;&#1496;&#1488;&#1493;) is caught by her, or, properly, in her, viz., the net-like woman, or the net to which she is compared (<a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18</a>). The harsh judgment is, however, not applicable to woman as such, but to woman as she is, with only rare exceptions; among a thousand women he has not found one corresponding to the idea of a woman. </body></html>
