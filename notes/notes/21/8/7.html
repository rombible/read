We must all die, no flight or hiding-place can save us, nor are there any weapons of effectual resistance. Ninety thousand die every day, upwards of sixty every minute, and one every moment.

He goes on with infatuated blindness to the doom that lies before him. The same thought appears in the mediæval proverb, “<span class="ital">Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat</span>,” or, in our modern condemnation of the rulers or the parties, who “learn nothing, and forget nothing.” The temper condemned is that (1) of the cynical egoism, which says, “<span class="ital">Apres moi, le deluge</span>,” (2) of those who act, because judgment is delayed, as if it would never come.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he knoweth not that which shall be</span>.

The wisdom of a man maketh his face bright, and the rudeness of his face is changed." Unlike this saying: "Who is like the wise?" are the formulas &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/107-43.htm">Psalm 107:43</a>, which are compared by Hitzig and others. "Who is like the wise?" means: Who is equal to him? and this question, after the scheme &#1502;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1502;&#1499;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, presents him as one who has not his like among men. Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1499;&#1501; might be used, after &#1500;&#1495;&#1499;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a>, etc. The syncope is, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>, omitted, which frequently occurs, particularly in the more modern books, <a href="/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/10-7.htm">2 Chronicles 10:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-10.htm">2 Chronicles 25:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-19.htm">Nehemiah 9:19</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-38.htm">Nehemiah 12:38</a>. The regular giving of Dagesh to &#1499; after &#1502;&#1497;, with Jethib, not Mahpach, is as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:7</a> after &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; Jethib is a disjunctive. The second question is not &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, but &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;, and thus does not mean: who is like the man of understanding, but: who understands, viz., as the wise man does; thus it characterizes the incomparably excellent as such. Many interpreters (Oetinger, Ewald, Hitz., Heiligst., Burg., Elst., Zckl.) persuade themselves that &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is meant of the understanding of the proverb, 8b. The absence of the art., says Hitzig, does not mislead us: of a proverb, viz., the following; but in this manner determinate ideas may be made from all indeterminate ones. Rightly, Gesenius: explicationem ullius rei; better, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a> : cujusvis rei. Ginsburg compares &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, which, however, does not mean him who has the knowledge of things, but who is well acquainted with words. It is true that here also the chief idea &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; first leads to the meaning verbum (according to which the lxx, Jer., the Targ., and Syr. translate; the Venet.: &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;); but since the unfolding or explaining (pe&#772;she&#780;r) refers to the actual contents of the thing spoken, verbi and rei coincide. The wise man knows how to explain difficult things, to unfold mysterious things; in short, he understands how to go to the foundation of things.<p>What now follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:1</a>, might be introduced by the confirming &#1499;&#1497;, but after the manner of synonymous parallelism it places itself in the same rank with 1a, since, that the wise man stands so high, and no one like him looks through the centre of things, is repeated in another form: "Wisdom maketh his face bright" is thus to be understood after <a href="/psalms/119-130.htm">Psalm 119:130</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>, wisdom draws the veil from his countenance, and makes it clear; for wisdom is related to folly as light is to darkness, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:13</a>. The contrast, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; ... &#1506;&#1494;&#1493; ("and the rudeness of his face is changed"), shows, however, that not merely the brightening of the countenance, but in general that intellectual and ethical transfiguration of the countenance is meant, in which at once, even though it should not in itself be beautiful, we discover the educated man rising above the common rank. To translate, with Ewald: and the brightness of his countenance is doubled, is untenable; even supposing that &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; can mean, like the Arab. yuthattay, duplicatur, still &#1506;&#1494;, in the meaning of brightness, is in itself, and especially with &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, impossible, along with which it is, without doubt, to be understood after az panim, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-50.htm">Deuteronomy 28:50</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>, and he&#772;'e&#772;z panim, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-13.htm">Proverbs 7:13</a>, or bephanim, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/21-29.htm">Proverbs 21:29</a>, so that thus &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1494; has the same meaning as the post-bibl. &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, stiffness, hardness, rudeness of countenance  equals  boldness, want of bashfulness, regardlessness, e.g., Shabbath 30b, where we find a prayer in these words: O keep me this day from &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1494;&#1497; and from &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508; (that I may not incur the former or the latter). The Talm. Taanith 7b, thus explaining, says: "Every man to whom &#1506;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508; belongs, him one may hate, as the scripture says, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; ... &#1493;&#1506;&#1494; (do not read &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;)." The lxx translates &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; will be hated, and thus also the Syr.; both have thus read as the Talm. has done, which, however, bears witness in favour of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; as the traditional reading. It is not at all necessary, with Hitzig, after Zirkel, to read yshane': but boldness disfigureth his countenance; &#1506;&#1494; in itself alone, in the meaning of boldness, would, it is true, along with &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; as the obj. of the verb, be tenable; but the change is unnecessary, the passive affords a perfectly intelligible meaning: the boldness, or rudeness, of his visage is changed, viz., by wisdom (Bttch., Ginsb., Zckl.). The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1513;&#1504;&#1488;, <a href="/lamentations/4-1.htm">Lamentations 4:1</a>) means, <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, merely "to change, to become different;" the Pih. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-33.htm">Jeremiah 52:33</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>, denotes in these two passages a change in melius, and the proverb of the Greek, Sir. 13:24, - <p>&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;<p>&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;,<p>is preserved to us in its original form thus:<p>&#1500;&#1489; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1475;<p>so that thus &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;, in the sense of being changed as to the sternness of the expression of the countenance, is as good as established. What Ovid says of science: emollit mores nec sinit esse feros, thus tolerably falls in with what is here said of wisdom: Wisdom gives bright eyes to a man, a gentle countenance, a noble expression; it refines and dignifies his external appearance and his demeanour; the hitherto rude external, and the regardless, selfish, and bold deportment, are changed into their contraries. If, now, <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:1</a> is not to be regarded as an independent proverb, it will bear somewhat the relation of a prologue to what follows. Luther and others regard <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:1</a> as of the nature of an epilogue to what goes before; parallels, such as <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a>, make that appear probable; but it cannot be yielded, because the words are not &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;, but &#1502;&#1497; &#1499;&#1492;&#1495;. But that which follows easily subordinates itself to <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:1</a>, in as far as fidelity to duty and thoughtfulness amid critical social relations are proofs of that wisdom which sets a man free from impetuous rudeness, and fits him intelligently and with a clear mind to accommodate himself to the time. </body></html>
