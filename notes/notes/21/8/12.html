That is ever so many times, a certain number for an uncertain; though he lives in a continued course of sin, being resolved upon the above consideration to give himself a swing to his lusts. The Targum renders it a hundred years; though be should live so long in sin, yet at last should be accursed <a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>. This and what follows are said to check the boldness and presumption of the sinner upon the patience of God; and to make the people of God easy under the delay of justice, and the prosperity of the wicked; <p>and his days be prolonged: or rather, "and he prolongs unto him" (o); that is, God prolongs unto him, not days only, but the execution of the sentence against his evil works; or defers his wrath and punishment; so Jarchi, <p>"and the holy blessed God prolongs to him, and does not take vengeance on him;'' <p>and to this purpose is the Targum, <p>"and from the Lord is given to him space to return;'' <p>yet surely I know; from the word and promise, and from experience, having observed it in a multitude of instances, which have abundantly confirmed the truth; <p>that it shall be well with them that fear God; not with a servile but filial fear, with a holy, humble, fiducial, affectionate, and an obediential fear; not through any terrible apprehension of his majesty, his judgment, his wrath now and hereafter; but under a sense of his being and perfections, and especially his mercy, grace, and goodness: it is well with such persons in all things; with respect to things temporal they shall not want what is proper for them; and with respect to things spiritual they are interested in the love, grace, and mercy of God; have much made known to them; are remembered by him; the sun of righteousness rises upon them; the eye of God is on them, and his heart towards them, and his hand communicates every needful supply to them; and they are guarded, not only by his angels, but by himself; and it is well with them at all times; in times of public calamity they are either taken from it beforehand, or preserved in it; all afflictions are for their good; it goes well with them at death and judgment; and they will be happy both in the millennium state and in the ultimate glory, So the Targum, <p>"it shall be well in the world to come with them that fear the Lord;'' <p>see <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; with this compare <a href="/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>; it is added, <p>which fear before him: whose fear is not hypocritical, but sincere and hearty; not in show only, but in reality; not the precepts of men, and as before them, but as the sight of God; having always a sense of omniscience and omnipresence before them; and especially this fear is exercised by them when they are his house, in the assembly of his saints, attending his word and ordinances: or "which fear at his presence"; which fills them with a holy awe, as wall as with joy and gladness. The Targum is, <p>"which fear before him, and do his will.'' <p>(o)  "et prolongans ei", Montanus; "et prolongat in Deus dies", Pagninus; so Mercerus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, supply it; "et prorogat dei Deus poenam", Piscator; "et differt Deus iram suam propter illium", Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Though a sinner do evil an hundred times</span>] The definite number is used, of course, as in <a href="/proverbs/17-10.htm" title="A reproof enters more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.">Proverbs 17:10</a>; or the “hundred years” of <a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm" title="There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.">Isaiah 65:20</a>; or the “seventy times seven” of <a href="/matthew/18-22.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I say not to you, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.">Matthew 18:22</a>, for the indefinite. There is no adequate reason for inserting “years” instead of “times.” By some grammarians it is maintained that the conjunctions should be read “<span class="ital">Because</span> a sinner …” and “<span class="ital">although</span> I know,” but the Authorised Version is supported by high authority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God</span>] The adverb “surely” has nothing answering to it in the Hebrew, and seems an attempt to represent the emphasis of the Hebrew pronoun.

His faith is gaining strength, and he believes, though, it may be, with no sharply defined notion as to time and manner, that the righteousness of God, which seems to be thwarted by the anomalies of the world, will in the long run assert itself. There is at least an inward peace with those who fear God, which no tyrant or oppressor can interfere with. The seeming tautology of the last clause is best explained by supposing that the term “God-fearers” had become (as in <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm" title="Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD listened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought on his name.">Malachi 3:16</a>) the distinctive name of a religious class, such as the <span class="ital">Chasidim</span> (the “Assideans” of <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-42.htm" title="Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law.">1Ma 2:42</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/7-13.htm" title="Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:">1Ma 7:13</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-6.htm" title="Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.">2Ma 14:6</a>), or “devout ones” were in the time of the Maccabees. The <span class="bld">Debater</span>, with the keen scent for the weaknesses of a hypocritical formalism, which we have seen in ch. <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm" title="Keep your foot when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil....">Ecclesiastes 5:1-7</a>, says with emphatic iteration, as it were, “when I say ‘God-fearing’ I mean those that do fear God in reality as well as name.” So in French men talk of <span class="ital">la vérité vraie</span>, or we might speak of “a liberal indeed liberal,” “religious people who <span class="ital">are</span> religious,” and so on.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though a sinner do evil a hundred times</span>. The sentence begins again, as ver. 11, with <span class="accented">asher</span>, followed by a participle; and the conjunction ought to be rendered "because," the statement made in the former verse being resumed and strengthened. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">attamen</span>, which our version follows. The Septuagint goes astray, translating, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "He that has sinned has done evil from that time." The sinner is here supposed to have transgressed continually without cheek or punishment. The expression, "a hundred times," is used indefinitely, as <a href="/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And his days be prolonged</span>; better, <span class="accented">prolongeth his days for it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the practice of evil, with a kind of contentment and satisfaction, the pronoun being the ethic dative. Contrary to the usual course of temporal retribution, the sinner often lives to old age The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Et per patientiam sustentatur</span>, which signifies that he is kept in life by God's long-suffering. Ginsburg gives, "and is perpetuated," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his progeny - which is a possible, but not a probable, rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Yet surely I know</span>; rather, <span class="accented">though I for my part know</span>. He has seen sinners prosper; this experience has been forced upon him; yet he holds an inward conviction that God's moral government will vindicate itself at some time and in some signal manner. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</span> This is not really tautological; it is compared to St. Paul's expression (<a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3</a>), "widows that are widows indeed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), implying that they are, in fact and life, what they profess to be. Delitzsch and Plumptre suggest that in Koheleth's time "God-fearers" had become the name of a religious class, as the <span class="accented">Chasidim</span>, or "Assideaus," in I Macc. 2:42; 7:13, etc. Certainly a trace of this so-named party is seen in <a href="/psalms/118-4.htm">Psalm 118:4</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>. When this adjustment of anomalies shall take place, whether in this life or in another, the writer says not here. In spite of all contrary appearances, he holds firm to his faith that it will be welt with the righteous in the long run. The comfort and peace of a conscience at rest, and the inward feeling that his life was ordered after God's will, would compensate a good man for much outward trouble; and if to this was added the assured hope of another life, it might indeed be said that it was well with him. The Septuagint has, "that they may fear before him," which implies that the mercy and loving-kindness of God, manifested in his care of the righteous, lead to piety and true religion. Cheyne ('Job and Solomon'), combining this verse with the next, produces a sense which is certainly not in the present Hebrew text, "For I know that it ever happens that a sinner does evil for a long time, and yet lives long, whilst he who fears before God is short-lived as a shadow." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For there is a time and decision for everything, for the wickedness of man becomes too great." From <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a> there follow four clauses with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;; by such monotonous repetition of one and the same word, the author also elsewhere renders the exposition difficult, affording too free a space for understanding the &#1499;&#1497; as confirming, or as hypothetical, and for co-ordinating or subordinating to each other the clauses with &#1499;&#1497;. Presupposing the correctness of our exposition of <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a>, the clause <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a> with &#1499;&#1497; may be rendered parenthetically, and that with &#1499;&#1497; in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a> hypothetically: "an end and decision the heart of the wise man will come to experience (because for everything there is an end and decision), supposing that the wickedness of man has become great upon him, i.e., his burden of guilt has reached its full measure." We suppose thereby (1) that &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, which appears from the accent on the ult. to be an adj., can also be the 3rd pret., since before &#1506; the tone has gone back to h (cf. <a href="/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), to protect it from being put aside; but generally the accenting of such forms of &#1506;&#1506; hovers between the penult. and the ult., e.g., <a href="/psalms/69-5.htm">Psalm 69:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-19.htm">Proverbs 14:19</a>. Then (2) that &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; goes back to &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; without distinction of persons, which has a support in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>, and that thus a great &#1512;&#1506;&#1492; is meant lying upon man, which finally finds its punishment. But this view of the relation of the clauses fails, in that it affords no connection for <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:7</a>. It appears to be best to co-ordinate all the four &#1499;&#1497; as members of one chain of proof, which reaches its point in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>, viz., in the following manner: the heart of a wise man will see the time and the judgment of the ruler, laying to his heart the temptation to rebellion; for (1) as the author has already said, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a> : "God will judge the righteous as well as the wicked, for there is with Him a time for every purpose and for every act;" (2) the wickedness of man (by which, as <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:9</a> shows, despots are aimed at) which he has committed, becomes great upon him, so that suddenly at once the judgment of God will break in upon him; (3) he knows not what will be done; (4) no one can tell him how (quomodo) it, the future, will be, so that he might in any way anticipate it - the judgment will overwhelm him unexpectedly and irretrievably: wickedness does not save its possessor. </body></html>
