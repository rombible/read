An objection is here started (entertained by Solomon in his apostasy), as in Ec 3:16; 7:15, to the truth of retributive justice, from the fact of the just and the wicked not now receiving always according to their respective deserts; a cavil, which would seem the more weighty to men living under the Mosaic covenant of temporal sanctions. The objector adds, as Solomon had said, that the worldling's pursuits are "vanity" (Ec 8:10), "I say (not 'said') this also is vanity. Then I commend mirth," &c. [Holden]. Ec 8:14, 15 may, however, be explained as teaching a cheerful, thankful use of God's gifts "under the sun," that is, not making them the chief good, as sensualists do, which Ec 2:2; 7:2, forbid; but in "the fear of God," as Ec 3:12; 5:18; 7:18; 9:7, opposed to the abstinence of the self-righteous ascetic (Ec 7:16), and of the miser (Ec 5:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which is done; </span> either by wicked potentates, who do commonly advance unworthy men, and oppress persons of greatest virtue and merit; or by God’s providence, who sees it fit for many weighty reasons so to manage the affairs of the present world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked, </span> i.e. the merit of their work; the work being oft put for the recompence given or belonging to it, as <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm" title="You shall not defraud your neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with you all night until the morning.">Leviticus 19:13</a> <a href="/job/7-2.htm" title="As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as an hireling looks for the reward of his work:">Job 7:2</a> <a href="/psalms/109-20.htm" title="Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.">Psalm 109:20</a></span>.

A modern writer, we feel, would have pruned, condensed, and avoided such a repetition of himself. We are dealing, however, with “Thoughts” like Pascal’s <span class="ital">Pensées</span>, rather than with a treatise, jotted down, it may be, day by day, as has been said before, on his tablets or his papyrus, and there is, as has been said before, something significant in the fact that, wherever the thinker turns, the same anomalies stare him in the face.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth</span>. The vanity is named in what follows, viz. the seeming injustice it, the distribution of good and evil. <span class="cmt_word">There be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked</span> (comp. ver. 10; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>). The melancholy fact is noted that the righteous often experience that fate with which the wicked are threatened, which their conduct might be expected to bring upon them. The verb translated "happeneth" (<span class="accented">nags</span>), with <span class="accented">el</span>, "to come to," "strike against," is thus used only in later Hebrew, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/esther/9-26.htm">Esther 9:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">According to the work of the righteous.</span> The wicked meet with that outward prosperity and success which were thought to be the special reward of those who served God. The Vulgate is explanatory, "There are just men whom evils befall as if they did the works of the wicked; and there are wicked men who are as free from care as if they had the deeds of the just." Commenting on <a href="/job/34-10.htm">Job 34:10, 11</a>, St. Gregory writes, "It is by no means always the case in this life that God renders to each man according to his work and according to his own ways. For both many who commit unlawful and wicked deeds he prevents of his free grace, and converts to works of holiness; and some who are devoted to good deeds he reproves by means of the scourge, and so afflicts those who please him, as though they were displeasing to him.... God doubtless so ordains it of his inestimable mercy, that both scourges should torture the just, lest their doings should elate them, and that the unjust should pass this life at least without punishment, because by their evil doings they are hastening onwards to those torments which are without end. For that the just are sometimes scourged in no way according to their deserts is shown by this history of Job. Elihu, therefore, would speak more truly if he had said that there is not unmercifulness and iniquity in God, even when he seems not to render to men according to their ways. For even that which we do not understand is brought forth from the righteous balance of secret judgment" ('Moral.,' 24:44). Koheleth ends by repeating his melancholy refrain, <span class="cmt_word">I said that this also</span> (<span class="accented">indeed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>is vanity</span>. This conclusion, however, does not lead to despair or infidelity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:7</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a> thus continue the For and For: "For he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him who it will be? There is no man who has power over the wind, to restrain the wind; and no one has authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the war; and wickedness does not save its possessor." The actor has the sin upon himself, and bears it; if it reaches the terminus of full measure, it suddenly overwhelms him in punishment, and the too great burden oppresses its bearer (Hitzig, under <a href="/isaiah/24-20.htm">Isaiah 24:20</a>). This &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; comes unforeseen, for he (the man who heaps up sins) knoweth not id quod fiet; it arrives unforeseen, for quomodo fiet, who can show it to him? Thus, e.g., the tyrant knows not that he will die by assassination, and no one can say to him how that will happen, so that he might make arrangements for his protection. Rightly the lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; on the contrary, the Targ., Hitzig, and Ginsburg: when it will be; <p>(Note: The Venet. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#837;&#788;&#834;, as if the text had &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;.)<p>but &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; signifies quum, <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, but not quando, which must be expressed by &#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (Mishnic &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;).<p>Now follows the concluding thought of the four &#1499;&#1497;, whereby <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a> is established. There are four impossibilities enumerated; the fourth is the point of the enumeration constructed in the form of a numerical proverb. (1) No man has power over the wind, to check the wind. Ewald, Hengst., Zckl., and others understand &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, with the Targ., Jerome, and Luther, of the Spirit (&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;( tir &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;); but man can limit this physically when he puts a violent termination to life, and must restrain it morally by ruling it, <a href="/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>. On the contrary, the wind hrwch is, after <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>, incalculable, and to rule over it is the exclusive prerogative of Divine Omnipotence, <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>. The transition to the second impossibility is mediated by this, that in &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, according to the usus loq., the ideas of the breath of animal life, and of wind as the breath as it were of the life of the whole of nature, are interwoven. (2) No one has power over the day of death: death, viz., natural death, comes to a man without his being able to see it before, to determine it, or to change it. With &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; there here interchanges &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503;, which is rendered by the lxx and Venet. as abstr., also by the Syr. But as at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>, so also above at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a>, it is concr., and will be so also in the passage before us, as generally in the Talm. and Midrash, in contradistinction to the abstr., which is &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503;, after the forms &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1503;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;, etc., e.g., Bereshith rabba, c. 85 extr.: "Every king and ruler &#1513;&#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503; who had not a &#1513;&#1493;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503;, a command (government, sway) in the land, said that that did not satisfy him, the king of Babylon had to place an under-Caesar in Jericho," etc.<p>(Note: Regarding the distinction between &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503;, vid., Baer's Abodath Jisrael, p. 385.)<p>Thus: no man possesses rule or is a ruler ... .<p>A transition is made from the inevitable law of death to the inexorable severity of the law of war; (3) there is no discharge, no dispensation, whether for a time merely (missio), or a full discharge (dimissio), in war, which in its fearful rigour (vid., on the contrary, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5-8</a>) was the Persian law. Even so, every possibility of escape is cut off by the law of the divine requital; (4) wickedness will not save (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, causative, as always) its lord (cf. the proverb: "Unfaithfulness strikes its own master") or possessor; i.e., the wicked person, when the &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1501; comes, is hopelessly lost. Grtz would adopt the reading &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; instead of &#1512;&#1513;&#1506;; but the fate of the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, or of the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, is certainly that to which the concatenation of thought from <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a> leads, as also the disjunctive accent at the end of the three first clauses of <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a> denotes. But that in the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (not &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) a despotic king is thought of (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>; cf. under <a href="/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>), is placed beyond a doubt by the epilogistic verse: </body></html>
