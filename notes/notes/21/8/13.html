The "prolonging" of his days there is only seeming, not real. Taking into account his eternal existence, his present days, however seemingly long, are really short. God's delay (Ec 8:11) exists only in man's short-sighted view. It gives scope to the sinner to repent, or else to fill up his full measure of guilt; and so, in either case, tends to the final vindication of God's ways.

But it is of the nature of the method of the book to teach by paradoxes, and to let the actual contradictions of the world reflect themselves in his teaching. What is meant is that the wicked does not gain by a prolonged life; that, as Isaiah had taught of old, “the sinner though he die a hundred years old, is as one accursed” (<a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm" title="There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.">Isaiah 65:20</a>). His life is still a shadow and “he disquieteth himself in vain” (<a href="/psalms/39-6.htm" title="Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heaps up riches, and knows not who shall gather them.">Psalm 39:6</a>). So the writer of the <span class="ital">Wisdom of Solomon</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm" title="There is one alone, and there is not a second; yes, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither said he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yes, it is a sore travail.">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>) writes, probably not without a reference to this very passage, that “honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by the number of the years.” In the “days which are as a shadow,” so far as they refer to the shortness of human life in general, we find, as before in ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm" title="For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, echoes of Greek thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is noticeable that in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-5.htm" title="For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again.">Wis 2:5</a>, in accordance with what one may call the polemic tendency of the writer, the thought and the phrase are put into the mouth of the “ungodly, who reasoned not aright.” The universal fact, however, has become a universal thought and finds echoes everywhere (<a href="/psalms/102-11.htm" title="My days are like a shadow that declines; and I am withered like grass.">Psalm 102:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-4.htm" title="Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passes away.">Psalm 144:4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it shall not be well with the wicked</span>. If experience seemed often to militate against this assertion, Koheleth's faith prevailed against apparent contradictions. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow.</span> Above we read of a wicked man enjoying a long, untroubled life; here the contrary is stated. Such contradictions are seen every day. There are inscrutable reasons for the delay of judgment; but on the whole moral government is vindicated, and even the long life of a sinner is no blessing. The author of the Book of Wisdom writes (4:8), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years;" and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), <span class="accented">"The</span> sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed." Man's life is compared to a shadow because it passes away with the setting sun (see on Ecclesiastes 6:12). The Vulgate, in order to obviate the apparent discrepancy between this and the preceding verses, renders the verb in a precatory form: <span class="accented">Non sit bonum impio</span>, etc., "Let it not be well with the wicked, and let his days not be prolonged; but let them pass away as a shadow who fear not the Lord." This is quite unnecessary; and the words, <span class="accented">"as a shadow,"</span> according to the accents, belong to what precedes, as in the Authorized Version. Hitzig and others have adopted the Vulgate division, and render, "Like a shadow is he who fears not God." But there is no sufficient reason for disregarding the existing accentuation. Septuagint, "He shall not prolong his days in a shadow (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fb7;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Because he feareth not before God</span>. This is the reason, looking to temporal retribution, why the wicked shall not live out half their days (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). Koheleth cleaves to the doctrine received from old time, although facts seem often to contradict it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:7</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a> thus continue the For and For: "For he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him who it will be? There is no man who has power over the wind, to restrain the wind; and no one has authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the war; and wickedness does not save its possessor." The actor has the sin upon himself, and bears it; if it reaches the terminus of full measure, it suddenly overwhelms him in punishment, and the too great burden oppresses its bearer (Hitzig, under <a href="/isaiah/24-20.htm">Isaiah 24:20</a>). This &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; comes unforeseen, for he (the man who heaps up sins) knoweth not id quod fiet; it arrives unforeseen, for quomodo fiet, who can show it to him? Thus, e.g., the tyrant knows not that he will die by assassination, and no one can say to him how that will happen, so that he might make arrangements for his protection. Rightly the lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; on the contrary, the Targ., Hitzig, and Ginsburg: when it will be; <p>(Note: The Venet. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#837;&#788;&#834;, as if the text had &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;.)<p>but &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; signifies quum, <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>, but not quando, which must be expressed by &#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (Mishnic &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1514;).<p>Now follows the concluding thought of the four &#1499;&#1497;, whereby <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a> is established. There are four impossibilities enumerated; the fourth is the point of the enumeration constructed in the form of a numerical proverb. (1) No man has power over the wind, to check the wind. Ewald, Hengst., Zckl., and others understand &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, with the Targ., Jerome, and Luther, of the Spirit (&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;( tir &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;); but man can limit this physically when he puts a violent termination to life, and must restrain it morally by ruling it, <a href="/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>. On the contrary, the wind hrwch is, after <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>, incalculable, and to rule over it is the exclusive prerogative of Divine Omnipotence, <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>. The transition to the second impossibility is mediated by this, that in &#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, according to the usus loq., the ideas of the breath of animal life, and of wind as the breath as it were of the life of the whole of nature, are interwoven. (2) No one has power over the day of death: death, viz., natural death, comes to a man without his being able to see it before, to determine it, or to change it. With &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; there here interchanges &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503;, which is rendered by the lxx and Venet. as abstr., also by the Syr. But as at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>, so also above at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a>, it is concr., and will be so also in the passage before us, as generally in the Talm. and Midrash, in contradistinction to the abstr., which is &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503;, after the forms &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;&#1503;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;, etc., e.g., Bereshith rabba, c. 85 extr.: "Every king and ruler &#1513;&#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503; who had not a &#1513;&#1493;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503;, a command (government, sway) in the land, said that that did not satisfy him, the king of Babylon had to place an under-Caesar in Jericho," etc.<p>(Note: Regarding the distinction between &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503;, vid., Baer's Abodath Jisrael, p. 385.)<p>Thus: no man possesses rule or is a ruler ... .<p>A transition is made from the inevitable law of death to the inexorable severity of the law of war; (3) there is no discharge, no dispensation, whether for a time merely (missio), or a full discharge (dimissio), in war, which in its fearful rigour (vid., on the contrary, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5-8</a>) was the Persian law. Even so, every possibility of escape is cut off by the law of the divine requital; (4) wickedness will not save (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1496;, causative, as always) its lord (cf. the proverb: "Unfaithfulness strikes its own master") or possessor; i.e., the wicked person, when the &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1501; comes, is hopelessly lost. Grtz would adopt the reading &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; instead of &#1512;&#1513;&#1506;; but the fate of the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, or of the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, is certainly that to which the concatenation of thought from <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a> leads, as also the disjunctive accent at the end of the three first clauses of <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a> denotes. But that in the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (not &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;) a despotic king is thought of (&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>; cf. under <a href="/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>), is placed beyond a doubt by the epilogistic verse: </body></html>
