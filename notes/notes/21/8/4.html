Or "dominion" (z). Authority goes along with his word of command; and there is an inferior magistracy, a subordinate power under him, ready to execute his will upon the rebellious and disobedient. Jarchi interprets it, the word of the holy blessed God; and the Targum, the word of that King who rules over all the world; where his word of doctrine comes, not in word only, it is with power: his written word is quick and powerful; the word of his Gospel preached is the power of God to salvation; or is accompanied with power to enlighten dark minds, quicken dead sinners, unstop deaf ears, soften hard hearts, and deliver men from the slavery of sin and Satan; it makes men, of enemies, friends to God, Christ, and good men; transforms them by the renewing of their minds, and comforts and establishes saints; all which is attributed to the word; and are the effects of almighty power, <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; his word of command also comes with power, being clothed with his authority; and is submitted to by his people in the day of his power upon them, who readily and cheerfully obey it; <p>and who may say unto him, what dost thou? call him to an account for, or complain of any of his works of creation, providence, or grace? This best agrees with God than with an earthly king; and is said of him elsewhere, <a href="/job/9-12.htm">Job 9:12</a>. <p>(z) "imperium", Montanus, Rambachius; "dominatio", Vatablus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Where the word of a king is, there is power</span>] Better, <span class="bld">Forasmuch as the word of a king is power</span>, or rather <span class="bld">authority.</span> The latter word in the Hebrew text is used in Chaldee as meaning a ruler, or potentate.

The covert protest of the writer shews itself in thus transferring, as with a grave irony, what belonged to the Divine King to the earthly ruler who claimed a like authority. The despot stands, or thinks he stands, as much above the questionings and complaints of his subjects, as the Supreme Ruler of the Universe does above those of men in general.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where the word of a king is, there is power.</span> A further confirmation of the last thought.

It is the ascertained result, "one man, etc.," which is solemnly introduced by the words preceding. Instead of &#1488;&#1501; &#1511;&#1492;, the words &#1512;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492; are to be read, after <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>, as is now generally acknowledged; errors of transcription of a similar kind are found at <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>; <a href="/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12</a>. Ginsburg in vain disputes this, maintaining that the name Koheleth, as denoting wisdom personified, may be regarded as fem. as well as mas.; here, where the female sex is so much depreciated, was the fem. self-designation of the stern judge specially unsuitable. Hengst. supposes that Koheleth is purposely fem. in this one passage, since true wisdom, represented by Solomon, stands opposite to false philosophy. But this reason for the fem. rests on the false opinion that woman here is heresy personified; he further remarks that it is significant for this fem. personification, that there is "no writing of female authorship in the whole canon of the O.T. and N.T." But what of Deborah's triumphal song, the song of Hannah, the magnificat of Mary? We hand this absurdity over to the Clementines! The woman here was flesh and blood, but pulchra quamvis pellis est mens tamen plean procellis; and Koheleth is not incarnate wisdom, but the official name of a preacher, as in Assyr., for &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1504;&#1512;&#1501;, curators, overseers, hazana&#770;ti <p>(Note: Vid., Fried. Delitzsch's Assyr. Stud. (1874), p. 132.)<p>is used. &#1494;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>, points, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>, to what follows. &#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1500;, one thing to another (cf. <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>), must have been, like summa summarum and the like, a common arithmetical and dialectical formula, which is here subordinate to &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, since an adv. inf. such as &#1500;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495; is to be supplemented: taking one thing to another to find out the &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., the balance of the account, and thus to reach a facit, a resultat.<p>(Note: Cf. Aboth iv. 29, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, "to give account;" &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1499;&#1500;, "all according to the result.")<p>That which presented itself to him in this way now follows. It was, in relation to woman, a negative experience: "What my soul sought on and on, and I found not, (is this)." The words are like the superscription of the following result, in which finally the &#1494;&#1492; of <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a> terminates. Ginsburg, incorrectly: "what my soul is still seeking," which would have required &#1502;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;. The pret. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (with &#1511; without Dagesh, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-29.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:29</a>)<p>(Note: As generally the Piel forms of the root &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;, Masor. all have Raphe on the ,&#1511; except the imper. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;; vid., Luzzatto's Gramm. 417.)<p>is retrospective; and &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, means redire, again and again, continually, as at Gen.. <a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>. He always anew sought, and that, as biqshah naphshi for &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497; denotes, with urgent striving, violent longing, and never found, viz., a woman such as she ought to be: a man, one of a thousand, I have found, etc. With right, the accentuation gives Garshayim to adam; it stands forth, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>, as a general denominator - the sequence of accents, Geresh, Pashta, Zakef, is as at <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>. "One among a thousand" reminds us of <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm">Job 33:23</a>, cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; the old interpreters (vid., Dachselt's Bibl. Accentuata), with reference to these parallels, connect with the one man among a thousand all kinds of incongruous christological thoughts. Only, here adam, like the Romanic l'homme and the like, means man in sexual contrast to woman. It is thus ideally meant, like ish, <a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a>, and accordingly also the parall. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;. For it is not to be supposed that the author denies thereby perfect human nature to woman. But also Burger's explanation: "a human being, whether man or woman," is a useless evasion. Man has the name adam &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;. by primitive hist. right: "for the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man," <a href="/1_corinthians/11-8.htm">1 Corinthians 11:8</a>. The meaning, besides, is not that among a thousand human beings he found one upright man, but not a good woman (Hitz.), - for then the thousand ought to have had its proper denominator, &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;, - but that among a thousand persons of the male sex he found only one man such as he ought to be, and among a thousand of the female sex not one woman such as she ought to be; "among all these" is thus  equals  among an equal number. Since he thus actually found the ideal of man only seldom, and that of woman still seldomer (for more than this is not denoted by the round numbers), the more surely does he resign himself to the following resultat, which he introduces by the word &#1500;&#1489;&#1491; (only, alone), as the clear gain of his searching: </body></html>
