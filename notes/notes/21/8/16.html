Reply to Ec 8:14, 15. When I applied myself to observe man's toils after happiness (some of them so incessant as not to allow sufficient time for "sleep"), then (Ec 8:17, the apodosis) I saw that man cannot find out (the reason of) God's inscrutable dealings with the "just" and with the "wicked" here (Ec 8:14; Ec 3:11; Job 5:9; Ro 11:33); his duty is to acquiesce in them as good, because they are God's, though he sees not all the reasons for them (Ps 73:16). It is enough to know "the righteous are in God's hand" (Ec 9:1). "Over wise" (Ec 7:16); that is, Speculations above what is written are vain.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I applied mine heart to know wisdom:</span> this he seems to add as the reason of that judgment which he had now passed, <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm" title="Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a></span>, because he had diligently studied wherein man’s wisdom did consist, and had observed the restlessness of men’s minds and bodies in other courses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To see the business; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

But, with submission, there seems to be no need of a parenthesis to cut off these words from the former, with whom they have a fit connexion. For having now mentioned the <span class="ital">business which is done</span>, or which man doeth, upon earth, he further adds, as an evidence of man’s eagerness in pursuing his business, <span class="ital">for even by day and by night he</span> (to wit, the busy man, which is easily understood from the foregoing clause) <span class="ital">seeth not sleep with his eyes</span>, i.e. he grudgeth himself even necessary refreshments, and disquiets himself with endless cares and labours, the fruit whereof he doth but little enjoy; and therefore it is better <span class="ital">to eat and drink</span>, &c., as I now said, <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm" title="Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labor the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a></span>.

The parenthetical clause expresses, with a familiar imagery, the sleepless meditation that had sought in vain the solution of the problem which the order and disorder of the world presented. So Cicero (<span class="ital">ad Fam</span>. vii. 30) says “<span class="ital">Fuit mirificâ vigilantiâ qui toto suo consulatu somnum non vidit</span>.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16</span> - <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>. - Section 7 (the division in the theme caused by the introduction of a new chapter is misleading). <span class="accented">Man's wisdom is incapable of explaining the course of God's providential government</span>; <span class="accented">death awaits all without any exception, whatever be their condition or actions</span>. These two considerations conduce to the old conclusion, that man had best enjoy life, only being careful to use it energetically and well. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - No mortal wisdom, combined with the closest observation and thought, can fathom the mysteries of God's moral government. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I applied mine heart</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>). The answering member of the sentence is in ver. 17, the last clause of the present verse being parenthetical. <span class="cmt_word">To know wisdom</span>. This was his first study (see on Ecclesiastes 1:16). He endeavored to acquire wisdom which might enable him to investigate God's doings. His second study was <span class="cmt_word">to see the business that is done upon the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only to learn what men do in their several stations and callings, but likewise to understand what all this means, what it tends to, its object and result. (For "business," <span class="accented">inyan</span>, see on Ecclesiastes 1:13.) The Vulgate here renders it <span class="accented">distentionem</span>, "distraction," which is like the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For also</span> there is that <span class="cmt_word">neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes</span>. This is a parenthetical clause expressing either the restless, unrelieved labor that goes on in the world, or the sleepless meditation of one who tries to solve the problem of the order and disorder in men's lives. In the latter case, Koheleth may be giving his own experience. To "see sleep" is to enjoy sleep. The phrase is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, but commentators quote parallels from classical sources. Thus Terence, 'Heautontim.,' 3:1.82 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Somnum hercle ego hac nocte cculis non vidi reels."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No sleep mine eyes have seen this livelong night."</span> Cicero, 'Ad Famil.,' 8:30, "Fuit mittflea vigilantia, qui tote sue consulatuson, hum non vidit." Of course, the expression is hyperbolical. The same idea is found without metaphor in such passages as <a href="/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And then I have seen the wicked buried, and they came to rest; but away from the holy place they had to depart, and were forgotten in the city, such as acted justly: also this is vain." The double particle &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; signifies, in such a manner, or under such circumstances; with "I have seen" following, it may introduce an observation coming under that which precedes (&#1489;&#1499;&#1503;  equals  Mishnic &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1498;), or, with the force of the Lat. inde, introduce a further observation of that ruler; this temporal signification "then" ( equals  &#1488;&#1494;), according to which we have translated, it has in the Targ. (vid., Levy's W.B.).<p>(Note: Cf. &#1493;&#1499;&#1503;, <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>; Ewald, 354a; Baer's Abodath Jisrael, pp. 384, 386.)<p>Apparently the observation has two different classes of men in view, and refers to their fate, contradicting, according to appearance, the rectitude of God. Opposite to the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; ("the wicked") stand they who are described as &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: they who have practised what is rightly directed, what stands in a right relation (vid., regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, as noun, under <a href="/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>), have brought the morally right into practice, i.e., have acted with fidelity and honour (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, as at <a href="/2_kings/7-9.htm">2 Kings 7:9</a>). Koheleth has seen the wicked buried; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; is followed by the particip. as predic. obj., as is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:21</a>; but &#1511;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is not followed by &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (which, besides not being distinct enough as part. perfecti, would be, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-22.htm">Nehemiah 13:22</a>, part. praes.), but, according to the favourite transition of the particip. into the finite, Gesen. 134. 2, by &#1493;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, not &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;; for the disjunctive Reba has the fuller form with waa; cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm">Job 17:10</a>, and above, at <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:23</a>. "To enter in" is here, after <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-2.htm">Isaiah 47:2</a>,  equals  to enter into peace, come to rest.<p>(Note: Cf. Zunz, Zur Gesch. u. Literatur, pp. 356-359.)<p>That what follows &#1493;&#1502;&#1501; does not relate to the wicked, has been mistaken by the lxx, Aquila, Symm., Theod., and Jerome, who translate by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, laudabantur, and thus read &#1497;&#1513;&#1514;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493; (the Hithpa., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm">Psalm 106:47</a>, in the pass. sense), a word which is used in the Talm. and Midrash along with &#1513;&#1514;&#1499;&#1495;&#1493;.<p>(Note: The Midrash Tanchuma, Par. &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;, init., uses both expressions; the Talm. Gittin 56b, applies the passage to Titus, who took away the furniture of the temple to magnify himself therewith in his city.)<p>The latter, testified to by the Targ. and Syr., is without doubt the correct reading: the structure of the antithetical parallel members is chiastic; the naming of the persons in 1a a precedes that which is declared, and in 1a b it follows it; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/70-5.htm">Psalm 70:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>. The fut. forms here gain, by the retrospective perfects going before, a past signification. &#1502;&#1511; &#1511;&#1491;, "the place of the holy," is equivalent to &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, as also at <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>. Ewald understands by it the place of burial: "the upright were driven away (cast out) from the holy place of graves." Thus e.g., also Zckl., who renders: but wandered far from the place of the holy ... those who did righteously, i.e., they had to be buried in graves neither holy nor honourable. But this form of expression is not found among the many designations of a burial-place used by the Jews (vid., below, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>, and Hamburger's Real-Encykl. fr Bibel u. Talm., article "Grab"). God's-acre is called the "good place," <p>(Note: Vid., Tendlau's Sprichw., No. 431.)<p>but not the "holy place." The "holy place," if not Jerusalem itself, which is called by Isaiah II (<a href="/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a>), Neh., and Dan., 'ir haqqodesh (as now el-k&#803;uds), is the holy ground of the temple of God, the &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#768;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>), as Aquila and Symm. translate. If, now, we find min connected with the verb halak, it is to be presupposed that the min designates the point of departure, as also &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1498; &#1502;&#1503;, <a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>. Thus not: to wander far from the holy place; nor as Hitz., who points &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;: they pass away (perish) far from the holy place. The subject is the being driven away from the holy place, but not as if &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468; were causative, in the sense of &#1497;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; fo esne, and meant ejiciunt, with an indef. subj. (Ewald, Heiligst., Elst.), - it is also, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>, only the intens. of Kal, - but &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468; denotes, after <a href="/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm">Job 30:28</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a>, the meditative, dull, slow walk of those who are compelled against their will to depart from the place which they love (<a href="/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>.). They must go forth (whither, is not said, but probably into a foreign country; cf. <a href="/amos/7-17.htm">Amos 7:17</a>), and only too soon are they forgotten in the city, viz., the holy city; a younger generation knows nothing more of them, and not even a gravestone brings them back to the memory of their people. Also this is a vanity, like the many others already registered - this, viz., that the wicked while living, and also in their death, possess the sacred native soil; while, on the contrary the upright are constrained to depart from it, and are soon forgotten. Divine rectitude is herein missed. Certainly it exists, and is also recognised, but it does not show itself always when we should expect it, nor so soon as appears to us to be salutary. </body></html>
