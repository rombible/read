Abject in his fear before Moses, he was ready to promise anything; insolent in his pride, he swallows down his promises as soon as fear is eased, his repentance and his retractation of it combined to add new weights about his neck. He was but a conspicuous example of a universal fault. Every nation, I suppose, has its proverb scoffing at the contrast between the sick man’s vow and the recovered man’s sins. The bitter moralist of the Old Testament was sure not to let such an instance of man’s inconceivable levity pass unnoticed. His settled habit of dragging to light the seamy side of human nature was sure to fall on this illustration of it as congenial food. He has wrapped up here in these curt, bitter words a whole theory of man’s condition, of God’s providence, of its abuse, and of the end to which it all tends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Note the delay in executing sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Every ‘evil work’ is already sentenced. ‘He that believeth not,’ said Christ, ‘is condemned already’; and that is one case of a general truth. The text writes the sentence as passed, though the execution is for a time suspended. What is the underlying fact expressed by this metaphor? God’s thorough knowledge of, and displeasure at, every evil. When one sees vile things done on earth, and no bolt coming out of the clear sky, it is not easy to believe that all the foulness is known to God; but His eye reaches further than He wills to stretch His arm. He sits a silent Onlooker and beholds; the silence does not argue indifference. The sentence is pronounced, but the execution is delayed. It is not wholly delayed, for there are consequences which immediately dog our evil deeds, and are, as it were, premonitions of a yet more complete penalty. But in the present order of things the connection between a man’s evil-doing and suffering is, on the whole, slight, obscure, and partial. Evil triumphs; goodness not seldom suffers. If one thinks for a moment of the manifold evils of the world, which swathe it, as it were, in an atmosphere of woe-the wars, the slavery, the oppressions, the private sorrows-and then thinks that there is a God who lets all these go on from generation to generation, we seem to be in the presence of a mystery of mysteries. The Psalmist of old exclaimed in adoring wonder, ‘Thy judgments are a great deep’; but the absence of His judgments seems to open a profounder abyss into which even the great mountains of His righteousness appear in danger of falling.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The reasons for this delay.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is not only a mystery, but it is a ‘mystery of love.’ We can see but a little way into it, but we can see so far as to be sure that the apparent passivity of God, which looks like leaving evil to work its unhindered will, is the silence of a God who ‘doth not willingly afflict,’ and is ‘slow to anger,’ because He is perfect love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The ground of necessity for the delay in executing the sentence lies, partly, in the probationary character of this present life. If evil-doing was always followed by swift retribution, obedience would be only the obedience of fear, and God does not desire such obedience. It would be impossible that testing could go on at all if at every instant the whole of the consequences of our actions were being realised. Such a condition of things is unthinkable, and would be as confusing, in the moral sphere, as if harvest weather and spring weather were going on together. Again, the great reason why sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily lies in God’s own heart, and His desire to win us to Himself by benefits. He does not seek enforced obedience; He neither desires our being wedded to evil, nor our being weighed upon by the consequences of our sin, and so He holds back His hand. It is to be remembered that He not merely does thus restrain the forthcoming of His hand of judgment, but, instead of it, puts forth a hand of blessing. He moves around us wooing us to Himself, and, in patience possessing His spirit, marks all our sins, but loves and blesses still. He gives us the vineyard, though we do not give Him the fruit. Still He is not angry, but sends His messengers, and we stone them. Still He waits: we go on heaping year upon year of rebellious forgetfulness, and no lightning flashes from His eye, no exclamation of wearied-out patience, comes from His lips, no rush of the sudden arrow from His long-stretched bow. The endless patience of God has no explanation but only this, that He loves us too well to leave any means untried to bring us to Him, and that He lingers round us to win our hearts. O rare and unspeakable love, the patient love of the patient God!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The abuse of this delay.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>We have the knack of turning God’s pure gifts into poison, and practise a devilish chemistry by which we distil venom from the flowers of Eden and the roses of the garden of God. I don’t suppose that to many men the respite which marks God’s dealing with them actually tends to doubts of His righteousness, or of His power, or of His being. We have evidence enough of these; and the apparently counter evidence, arising from the impunity of evil-doers, is fairly enough laid aside by our moral instincts and consciousness, and by the consideration that the mighty sweep of God’s providence is too great for us to decide on the whole circle by the small portion of the circumference which we have seen. But what most men do is simply that they permit impunity to deaden their sense of right and wrong, and go on in their course without any serious thought of God’s blessings, to jostle Him out of their mind; they ‘<span class="ital">despise the riches of His long-suffering goodness</span>,’ and never suffer it to ‘<span class="ital">lead them to repentance.</span>’ To the unthinking minds of most of us, the long continuance of impunity lulls us into a dream of its perpetuity. Man’s godless ingratitude is as deep a mystery as is God’s loving patience. It is strange that, with such constant failure of His love to win, God should still persevere in it. For more than seventy times seven He persists in forgiving the rebellious child who sins against Him, and for more than seventy times seven the child persists in the abuse of the Father’s love, which still remains-an abuse of sin above all sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The end of the delay.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The sentence is passed. It is impossible that it should not be executed. When God has done all, and sees that the point of hopelessness is reached, or when the time has for other reasons come, then He lets the sentence take effect. He kept back the destroying angels from Sodom, but He sent them forth at last. There is a point in the history of nations and of men when iniquity is ‘full,’ and when God sees that it is best, on world-wide grounds or personal ones, to end it. So there come for nations and for individuals crises; and the law for the divine working is, ‘A short work will the Lord make on the earth.’ For long years Noah was building the ark, and exposed to the scoffs of a generation whose sentence had been pronounced and not yet executed; but the day came when he entered into its covert, and ‘the flood came and destroyed them all.’ For generations He would fain have gathered the people of Jerusalem to His bosom ‘as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and they would not’; but the day came when the Roman soldiers cast their torches into the beautiful house where their fathers had praised Him, and sinned against Him, and it was left unto them desolate. Let us not be high-minded nor victims of our levity and inconsiderateness, but fear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Let us remember too that the intensity of the execution is aggravated by all the sins committed during the delay. By them we ‘treasure wrath against the day of wrath.’ He says to His angels at last ‘Now,’ and the sword falls, and justice is done. ‘The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small.’ The sum of the whole matter is, every evil of ours is sentenced already; the punishment is delayed for our sins, and because Christ has died. God is wooing our hearts, and trying to win us to love Him by the holding back of the sentence which we are daily abusing. Shall we not accept His forbearance and take His gifts as tokens of the patient tenderness of His heart? Or are we to be like ‘the brutes that perish,’ knowing neither the hand that feeds them, nor the hand that kills them. The delay in rendering ‘the just recompence of reward’ only aggravates its weight when it falls. As in some levers, the slower the motion, the greater the force of the lift.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm" title="Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Because sentence against an evil work </span>— God’s determinate counsel for the punishment of all evil doers; <span class="ital">is not executed speedily </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But is oftentimes delayed for some time, to give them space for repentance; <span class="ital">therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מלא לב</span>, <span class="ital">their heart is filled, </span>or, as the LXX, render it <span class="greekheb">επληροφορηθη καρδια </span><span class="ital">is carried on with full sail, </span>like a ship with a strong and violent wind; or, <span class="ital">is bold, </span>or <span class="ital">presumptuous, </span>as the same phrase is used elsewhere.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:9-13 Solomon observed, that many a time one man rules over another to his hurt, and that prosperity hardens them in their wickedness.

Its primary meaning seems to be “a thing sent” and so the king’s missive or edict. The point of the reflection is that the anomaly noted in the previous verse was not only evil in itself, but the cause of further evil by leading men to think they could go on transgressing with impunity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is fully set in them to do evil</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">their heart is full in them.</span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The verse states one of the results of God's forbearance in punishing the evil. <span class="cmt_word">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily.</span> The verse begins with <span class="accented">asher,"</span> because," as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, which connects the sentence with the allegation of vanity just preceding, as well as with what follows. <span class="accented">Pithgam</span>, "sentence," "edict," is a foreign word of Persian origin, found in <a href="/esther/1-20.htm">Esther 1:20</a> and in Chaldee portions of Ezra (<a href="/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>, etc.). God seems to us to delay in punishing the guilty because we behold only one little portion of the course of his providence; could we take a more comprehensive view, anomalies would disappear, and we should see the end of these men (<a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>). But a contracted, skeptical view leads to two evils - first, a weakening of faith in God's moral government; and second, a miserable fatalism which denies man's responsibility and saps his energy. Of the former of these results Koheleth here treats. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the heart of the sons of men.</span> The heart is named as the seat of thought and the prime mover of action (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; <a href="/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is fully set in them to do evil</span>; literally, <span class="accented">is full in them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their heart becomes filled with thoughts which are directed to evil, or full of courage, hence "emboldened" (Revised Version margin) to do evil. Vulgate, <span class="accented">absque timore ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala</span>; Septuagint, "Because there is no contradiction (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) made on the part of (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) those who do evil speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully persuaded (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) in them to do evil." The long-suffering of God, instead of leading such men to repentance, hardens them in their infidelity (<a href="/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>). Primarily, the reference is still to tyrannical despots, who, in their seeming impunity, are em-boldened to pursue their evil course. But the statement is true generally. As Cicero says, "Quis ignorat maximam illecebram esse peccandi impunitatis spem?" ('Pro Milone,' 16.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Whoso remaineth true to the commandment will experience nothing evil; and the heart of the wise man will know a time and judicial decision." That by &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492; is here to be understood not the commandment of God, at least not immediately, as at <a href="/proverbs/19-16.htm">Proverbs 19:16</a> (Ewald), but that of the king, and generally an injunction and appointment of the superior authority, is seen from the context, which treats not of God, but of the ruler over a state. Knobel and others explain: He who observeth the commandment engageth not with an evil thing, and the wise mind knoweth time and right. But &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is never thus used (the author uses for this, &#1489;&#1468; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;), and the same meaning is to be supposed for the repeated &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;: it means to arrive at the knowledge of; in the first instance: to suffer, <a href="/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>; in the second, to experience, <a href="/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>. It may also, indeed, be translated after <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a> : a wise heart knoweth time and judgment, viz., that they will not fail; but why should we not render &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; both times fut., since nothing stands in the way? We do not translate: a wise heart, a wise mind (Knobel), although this is possible, <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a> (cf. <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>), but: the heart of a wise man, which is made more natural by <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:2</a>, <a href="/proverbs/16-23.htm">Proverbs 16:23</a>. The heart of a wise man, which is not hurried forward by dynastic oppression to a selfish forgetfulness of duty, but in quietness and hope (<a href="/lamentations/3-26.htm">Lamentations 3:26</a>) awaits the interposition of God, will come to the knowledge that there is an eth, a time, when oppression has an end, and a mishpat, when it suffers punishment. Well adapted to the sense in which eth is here used is the remark of Elia Levita in his Tishbi, that &#1494;&#1502;&#1503; corresponds to the German Zeit and the Romanic tempo, but &#1506;&#1514; to the German Ziel and the Romanic termino. The lxx translates &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;; and, inf act, &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1501; is a hendiadys, which, however, consists in the division of one conception into two. The heart of the wise man remaining true to duty will come to learn that there is a terminus and judicial decision, for everything has an end when it falls under the fate for which it is ripe, especially the sinner. </body></html>
