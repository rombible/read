Wherever we turn, we see melancholy proofs of the wickedness and misery of mankind, who try to create trouble to themselves and to each other. Being thus hardly used, men are tempted to hate and despise life. But a good man, though badly off while in this world, cannot have cause to wish he had never been born, since he is glorifying the Lord, even in the fires, and will be happy at last, for ever happy. Ungodly men have most cause to wish the continuance of life with all its vexations, as a far more miserable condition awaits them if they die in their sins.

The wise man, according to Aben Ezra, returned from the thought, which he had expressed in the latter part of the preceding chapter, that it was good for a man to rejoice in his works, and called it in; since he could not rejoice, when he considered the oppression and violence that were in the world; but it does not appear that he did call it in, for he afterwards repeats it: or rather he returns to his former subject, the abuse of power and authority, mentioned <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>; and from whence he had digressed a little by the above observation; and takes a review of all kinds of oppressions which are done, and of all sorts of "oppressed" (x) ones, as some render it, which become so, under the sun; subjects by their prince; the stranger, widow, and fatherless, by unjust judges; the poor by the rich; servants and labourers by their masters; and the like. Moreover, he saw by the Holy Ghost, as Jarchi paraphrases it, all oppressions by a spirit of prophecy; he foresaw all the oppressions that would be done under the sun; as all the injuries done to the people of Israel in their several captivities; so to the church of Christ in Gospel times; all the persecutions of Rome Pagan, and also of Rome Papal; all that has or will be done by antichrist, the man of the earth, who before long will oppress no more, <a href="/psalms/10-18.htm">Psalm 10:18</a>; the Targum restrains these oppressions to those which are done to the righteous in this world: and it is well observed by the wise man, that they are such as are under the sun, for there are none above it, nor any beyond the grave, <a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>; <p>and behold the tears of such as were oppressed; which their eyes poured out, and which ran down their cheeks, and were all they could do, having no power to help themselves: it is in the singular number, "and behold the tear" (y); as if it was one continued stream of tears, which, like a torrent, flowed from them; or as if they had so exhausted the source of nature by weeping, that the fountain of tears was dried up, and scarce another could drop; or it was as much as could be, that another should drop from them: and this the wise man could not well behold, without weeping himself; it being the property of a good man to weep with them that weep, especially with good men oppressed; <p>and they had no comforter; to speak a comfortable word to them; not so much as to do that which would be some alleviation of their sorrow, much less to help them, no human comforter; and this is a very deplorable condition, <a href="/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a>; indeed, when this is the case, good men under their oppressions have a divine Comforter; God comforts them under all their tribulations; one of the names of the Messiah is "the Consolation of Israel", <a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>; and the Spirit of God is "another Comforter", <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>; and such are well off, when all other comforters are miserable ones, or other men have none; <p>and on the side of their oppressors there was power; to crush them and keep them under, or to hinder others from helping or comforting them: or there was no "power to deliver them out of the hand of their oppressors" (z); so some render and supply the words; with which sense agrees the Targum, <p>"and there is none to redeem them out of the hand of their oppressors, by strength of hand and by power.'' <p>It may be rendered, "out of the hand of their oppressors comes power", or violence; such as the oppressed are not able to withstand; so the Arabic version; <p>but they had no comforter: which is repeated, not so much for confirmation, as to excite attention and pity, and to express the affliction of the oppressed, and the cruelty of others; and this following on the other clause, leads to observe, that the power of the oppressor is what hinders and deters others from comforting. Jarchi interprets this whole verse of the damned in hell, punished for their evil works, weeping for their souls oppressed by the destroying angels; and so, he says, it is, explained in an ancient book of theirs, called Siphri. <p>(x) "oppressos", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Drusius, Schmidt, Rambachius, so Broughton; "fraudatos", Cocceius.

It may be noted that the tone is that of a deeper compassion than before. He sees the tears of the oppressed and sighs at their hopelessness: “Oh, the pity of it! the pity of it!” We can see in this new element of despair, that which was the beginning of a better life. The man was passing, to use modern terms, from egoism to altruism, thinking more of the misery of others than of his own enjoyment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they had no comforter</span>] The iteration rings like a knell of doom. The words have sometimes been taken as if they meant “they had no advocate, none to plead their cause,” but there is no sufficient reason for abandoning the more natural meaning. It was the bitterest drop in their cup, that men met with no sympathy, no visits of consolation such as Job’s friends paid him. They found none to pity or to comfort them. So the absence of comforters is the crown of sorrow in <a href="/psalms/69-20.htm" title="Reproach has broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.">Psalm 69:20</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-2.htm" title="She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she has none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.">Lamentations 1:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-7.htm" title="Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.">Jeremiah 16:7</a>, as its presence was one of the consolations of the bereaved household of Bethany (<a href="/john/11-19.htm" title="And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.">John 11:19</a>). It may be noted, that, as far as it goes, this picture of the social state in which the <span class="bld">Debater</span> found himself is in favour of a later date than that of Solomon. The picture of that king’s reign was, like that of the days of “good Queen Bess” in our own history, one of almost proverbial prosperity; the people “eating, drinking and making merry” (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm" title="Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.">1 Kings 4:20</a>), and his administration, as far as his own subjects were concerned, one of “judgment and justice” (<a href="/1_kings/10-9.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he you king, to do judgment and justice.">1 Kings 10:9</a>). It was probably equally true of the Persian kings and of the Ptolemies that their rule was cruel and oppressive. The picture which Justin gives of the state of Egypt under Ptolemy Philopator (xxix. 1) and Ptolemy Epiphanes exactly corresponds with that drawn by Koheleth.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - Section 5. Koheleth proceeds to give further illustrations of <span class="accented">man's inability to be the architect of his own happiness</span>. There are many things which interrupt or destroy it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - First of all, he adduces the oppression of man by his fellow-man. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun.</span> This is equivalent to, "again I saw," as ver. 7, with a reference to the wickedness in the place of judgment which he had noticed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>. <span class="accented">Ashukim</span>, "oppressions," is found in <a href="/job/35-9.htm">Job 35:9</a> and <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>, and, being properly a participle passive, denotes oppressed persons or things, and so abstractedly "oppressions." <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">calumnias</span> (Vulgate). The verb is used of high-handed injustice, of offensive selfishness, of the hindrances to his neighbor's well-being caused by a man's careless disregard of aught but his own interests (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/12-4.htm">1 Samuel 12:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Beheld the tears of such as were oppressed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">innocentium</span> (Vulgate). He notes now not merely the fact of wrong being done, but its effect on the victim, and intimates his own pity for the sorrow. And they had no comforter. A sad refrain, echoed again at the end of the verse with touching pathos. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); they had no earthly friends to visit them in their affliction, and they as yet knew not the soothing of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). There was no one to wipe away their tears (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>) or to redress their wrongs. The point is the powerlessness of man in the face of these disorders, his inability to right himself, the incompetence of others to aid him. <span class="cmt_word">On the side of their oppressors there was power</span> (koach), in a bad sense, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> equivalent to "violence." Thus the ungodly say, in the Book of Wisdom 2:11, "Let our strength be the law of justice." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec posse resistere eorun violentiae</span>, <span class="accented">cunctorum auxilio destitutes</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is difficult to suppose that the state of things revealed by this verse existed in the days of King Solomon, or that so powerful a monarch, and one admired for "judgment and justice" (<a href="/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>), would be content with complaining of such disorders instead of checking them. There is no token of remorse for past unprofitableness or anguish of heart at the thought of failure in duty. If we take the words as the utterance of the real Solomon, we do violence to history, and must correct the existing chronicles of his reign. The picture here presented is one of later times, and it may be of other countries. Persian rule, or the tyranny of the Ptolemies, might afford an original from which it might be taken. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I said in mine heart: God shall judge the righteous as well as the wicked: for there is there a time for every purpose and for every work." Since "the righteous" stands first, the word &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; has here the double sense of judging [richtens  equals  setting upright]  equals  acting uprightly, justly by one, as in the shofteni of <a href="/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a>, etc., and of judging  equals  inflicting punishment.

But this does not immediately happen, and has to be waited for a long time, for there is a definite time for every undertaking (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>), and for (&#1506;&#1500;, in the more modern form of the language, interchanges promiscue with &#1488;&#1500; ht and &#1500;, e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a>; Ewald, 217i) every work there is a "time." This &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, defended by all the old interpreters, cannot have a temporal sense: tunc  equals  in die judicii (Jerome, Targ.), cf. <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-13.htm">Psalm 36:13</a>, for "a time of judgment there is for all one day" is not intended, since certainly the &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; (day of judgment) is this time itself, and not the time of this time. Ewald renders &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; as pointing to the past, for he thus construes: the righteous and the unrighteous God will judge (for there is a time for everything), and judge (vav thus explicat., "and that too," "and indeed") every act there, i.e., everything done before. But this &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is not only heavy, but also ambiguous and purposeless; and besides, by this parenthesizing of the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; for there is a time for everything, the principal thought, that with God everything, even His act of judgment, has its time, is robbed of its independence and of the place in the principal clause appropriate to it. But if &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is understood adverbially, it certainly has a local meaning connected with it: there, viz., with God, apud Deum; true, for this use of the word <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a> affords the only example, and it stands there in the midst of a very solemn and earnest address. Therefore it lies near to read, with Houbig., Dderl., Palm., and Hitz., &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "a definite time ... has He (God) ordained;" &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1501; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;) is the usual word for the ordinances of God in the natural world and in human history (<a href="/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-23.htm">Numbers 24:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>, etc.), and, as in the Assyr. simtuv, so the Heb. &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; (&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;), <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm">2 Samuel 13:32</a>, signifies lot or fate, decree.<p>(Note: Vid., Schrader's Keilsch. u. A. T. p. 105, simtu ubilsu, i.e., fate snatched him away (Heb. simah hovilathhu), cf. Fried. Delitzsch's Assyr. Stud. p. 66f.)<p>With this reading, Elster takes exception to the position of the words; but at <a href="/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a> also the object goes before &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, and "unto every purpose and for every work" is certainly the complement of the object-conception, so that the position of the words is in reality no other than at <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17</a>. Quite untenable is Herzfeld's supposition (Frst, Vaih.), that &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; has here the Talm. signification: aestimat, taxat, for (1) this &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  Arab. sham, has not &#1506;&#1500;, but the accus. after it; (2) the thought referring to the tie on which <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a> rests is thereby interrupted. Whether we read &#1513;&#1474;&#1501;, or take &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; in the sense of &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; (<a href="/job/25-2.htm">Job 25:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/23-14.htm">Job 23:14</a>, etc.), the thought is the same, and equally congruous: God will judge the innocent and the guilty; it shall be done some time, although not so soon as one might wish it, and think necessary, for God has for every undertaking and for every work its fixed time, also its judicial decision (vid., at <a href="/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a>); He permits wickedness, lets it develope itself, waits long before He interposes (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>.).<p>Reflecting on God's delay to a time hidden from men, and known only to Himself, Koheleth explains the matter to himself in the following verse: -  </body></html>
