In all things union tends to success and safety, but above all, the union of Christians. They assist each other by encouragement, or friendly reproof. They warm each other's hearts while they converse together of the love of Christ, or join in singing his praises. Then let us improve our opportunities of Christian fellowship. In these things all is not vanity, though there will be some alloy as long as we are under the sun.

The wise man takes occasion, from the solitariness Of the covetous man before described, to show in this and some following verses the preferableness and advantages of social life; which, as it holds true in things natural and civil, so in things spiritual and religious; man is a sociable creature, was made to be so; and it was the judgment of God, which is according to truth, and who can never err, that it was not good for man to be alone, <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>. It is best to take a wife, or at least to have a friend or companion, more or less to converse with. Society is preferable to solitariness; conversation with a friend is better than to be always alone; the Targum is, <p>"two righteous men in a generation are better than one;'' <p>such may be helpful to each other in their counsels and comforts, and mutual aids and assistances in things temporal and spiritual. The Midrash interprets this of the study in the law together, and of two that trade together, which is better than studying or trading separately; <p>because they have a good reward for their labour; the pleasure and profit they have in each other's company and conversation; in religious societies, though there is a labour in attendance on public worship, in praying and conferring together, in serving one another in love, and bearing one another's burdens, yet they have a good reward in it all; they have the presence of Christ with them, for, where two or three are met together in his name, he is with them; and whatsoever two of them agree to ask in his name they have it; and if two of them converse together about spiritual things, it is much if he does not make a third with them; besides they have a great deal of pleasure in each other's company, and much profit in their mutual instructions, advices, and reproofs; they sharpen each other's countenances, quicken and comfort each other's souls, establish one another in divine truth, and strengthen each other's hands and hearts. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Two <i>are</i> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</span><p>(f) As when man is alone, he can neither help himself nor others, he shows that men should live in mutual society to the intent that they may be profitable one to another, and that their things may increase.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Two are better than one</span>] The strain of moralising which follows indicates at least the revived capacity for a better feeling. As the <span class="bld">Debater</span> had turned from the restless strivings of the seeker after wealth to the simple enjoyment of the labouring man or even the sensuous pleasure of the indolent, so now he turns from the isolation of the avaricious to the blessings of companionship. Here at least, in that which carries a man out of himself, there is a real good, a point scored as “gain.” Here also, over and above his own experience the Seeker may have been helped by the current thought of his Greek teachers, the <span class="greekheb">κοινά τὰ φίλων</span> of the proverb, or the lines of Homer,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Σύν τε δύ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἐρχομένω</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τε πρὸ ὃ τοῦ ἐνόησεν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ὅππως κέρδος ἔῃ</span>• <span class="greekheb">μοῦνος δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">εἴπερ τε νοήσῃ</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἀλλά τε οἱ βράσσων τε νόυς λεπτὴ δέ τε μῆτις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“When two together go, each for the other<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Is first to think what best will help his brother;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But one who walks alone, though wise in mind,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of purpose slow and counsel weak we find.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Iliad</span>, x. 224–6.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So the Greek proverb ran as to friends<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χεὶρ χεῖρα νίπτει</span>, <span class="greekheb">δακτυλός τε δάκτυλον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“Hand cleanseth hand, and finger finger helps.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “good reward” is more than the mere money result of partnership, and implies the joy of<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“United thoughts and counsels, equal hope<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And hazard.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The literature of well-nigh all ages and races abound in expressions of the same thought. Aristotle dedicates two whole books (viii. ix.) of his Ethics to the subject of Friendship, and Cicero made it the theme of one of his most finished essays. Commonly, however, men rested it, as the writer does here, mainly on the basis of utility. “The wise man,” says Seneca (<span class="ital">Epist</span>. ix. 8) from his higher Stoic standpoint, “needs a friend, not as Epicurus taught, that he may have one to sit by his bed when he is ill, or to help him when he is poor or in prison, but that he may have one by whose bed he may sit, whom he may rescue when he is attacked by foes.” We may point also to <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm" title="A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm" title="Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.">Proverbs 27:17</a>, and the Jewish proverb “a man without friends is like a left hand without the right” (<span class="ital">Pirke Aboth</span>, f. 30. 2) as utterances of a like nature. It is, however to be noted, in connexion with the line of thought that has been hitherto followed in these notes as to the date and authorship of the book, that the preciousness of friendship as one of the joys of life was specially characteristic of the school of Epicurus (Zeller, <span class="ital">Stoics and Epicureans</span>, c. xx.). It was with them the highest of human goods, and the wise would value it as the chief element of security (Diog. Laert. x. 1. 148). The principle thus asserted finds, it may be added, its highest sanction in the wisdom of Him who sent out His disciples “two and two together” (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if they fall</span>] The special illustration appears to be drawn from the experience of two travellers. If one slip or stumble on a steep or rocky path the other is at hand to raise him, while, if left to himself, he might have perished.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Koheleth dwells upon the evils of isolation, and contrasts with them the comfort of companionship. <span class="cmt_word">Two are better than one</span>.

Only the annexed designation of the subject is peculiar; the syntactic possibility of this connection is established by <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>, and, in the second rank, by <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14</a>. Yet &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; might well enough have been omitted had &#1493;&#1513; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488; not stood too remote. Regarding &#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; <p>(Note: Thus punctuated with Segol under Daleth, and ,&#1504; raphatum, in F. H. J. P. Thus also Kimchi in W.B. under &#1506;&#1491;.)<p>and &#1506;&#1491;&#1503;. The circumstantial form of the expression: prae vivis qui vivi sunt adhuc, is intentional: they who are as yet living must be witnesses of the manifold and comfortless human miseries.<p>It is a question whether <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a> begins a new clause (lxx, Syr., and Venet.) or not. That &#1488;&#1514;, like the Arab. aiya, sometimes serves to give prominence to the subject, cannot be denied (vid., Bttcher, 516, and Mhlau's remarks thereto). The Mishnic expressions &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, that day, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, that land, and the like (Geiger, 14. 2), presuppose a certain preparation in the older language; and we might, with Weiss (Stud. ueber d. Spr. der Mishna, p. 112), interpret &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; in the sense of &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, is qui. But the accus. rendering is more natural. Certainly the expression &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, "to praise," "to pronounce happy," is not used; but to &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; it is natural to suppose &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; added. Jerome accordingly translates: et feliciorem utroque judicavi qui necdum natus est. &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; has the double Kametz, as is generally the case, except at <a href="/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a> and <a href="/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>.<p>(Note: Vid., Heidenheim, Meor Enajim, under <a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>.)<p>Better than he who is born is the unborn, who does not become conscious of the wicked actions that are done under the sun. A similar thought, with many variations in its expression, is found in Greek writers; see regarding these shrill discordances, which run through all the joy of the beauty and splendour of Hellenic life, my Apologetick, p. 116. Buddhism accordingly gives to nirvna the place of the highest good. That we find Koheleth on the same path (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>), has its reason in this, that so long as the central point of man's existence lies in the present life, and this is not viewed as the fore-court of eternity, there is no enduring consolation to lift us above the miseries of this present world. </body></html>
