Selfishness is the cause of this evil. A selfish man cares for nobody; there is none to take care of but himself, yet he will scarcely allow necessary rest to himself, and the people he employs. He never thinks he has enough. He has enough for his calling, for his family, but he has not enough for his eyes. Many are so set upon the world, that in pursuit of it they bereave themselves, not only of the favour of God and eternal life, but of the pleasures of this life. The distant relations or strangers who inherit such a man's wealth, never thank him. Covetousness gathers strength by time and habit; men tottering on the brink of the grave, grow more grasping and griping. Alas, and how often do we see men professing to be followers of Him, who, though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, anxiously scraping money together and holding it fast, excusing themselves by common-place talking about the necessity of care, and the danger of extravagance!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A second - Any one associated or connected with him.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. not a second&#8212;no partner.<p>child&#8212;"son or brother," put for any heir (De 25:5-10).<p>eye&#8212;(Ec 1:8).

According to Aben Ezra, either no friend or companion, or no servant, or no wife, which last sense he prefers; no friend or companion he chooses, because friendship and fellowship lead to expenses; and no servant who would be chargeable to him; and no wife, which would be more expensive, and bring on a family of children; wherefore, to save charges, he chooses to have neither of these; for this is a covetous man who is here desert bed; <p>yea, he hath neither child nor brother; to inherit his substance, as the Targum adds; some worldly men, whose bellies are filled with hidden treasures, having enjoyed much, when they die, leave the rest of their substance to their babes; but the man here described has no children, nor any relations to leave his wealth unto; <p>yet is there no end of all his labour; when he has executed one scheme to get riches, he forms another; and having finished one work, he enters upon another; he rises early and sits up late, and works and toils night and day, as if he was not worth a dollar, and had a large and numerous family to provide for; or there is no end of what he labours for, or gets by his labour; there is no end of his treasures, <a href="/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>; he is immensely rich, so Aben Ezra interprets it; <p>neither is his eye satisfied with riches: with seeing his bags of gold and silver, though he takes a great deal of sure in looking upon them too, without making use of them; yet he is not satisfied with what he has, he wants more, he enlarges his desire as hell, and like the grave never has enough; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>; <p>neither saith he, for whom do I labour? having neither wife nor child, nor relation, nor friend, and yet so wretchedly stupid and thoughtless as never once to put this question to himself, Who am I toiling for? I am heaping up riches, and know not who shall gather them; it is a vexation to a worldly man to leave his substance behind him, and even to a man that has an heir to inherit it, when he knows not whether he will be a wise man or a fool; but for a man that has no heir at all, and yet to be toiling and labouring for the world, is gross stupidity, downright madness, and especially when he deprives himself of the comfort of what he is possessed of; <p>and bereave my soul of good? instead of richly enjoying what is given him, he withholds it from himself, starves his back and belly, lives in pinching want amidst the greatest plenty; has not power to eat of what he has, and his soul desireth; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>. <p>This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail; a very vain and wicked thing; "an evil business", as it may be rendered; a very great sin and folly indeed; it is thought by some divines to be the worst species of covetousness, most cruel and unnatural. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?

That which strikes him as another example of the vanity of human efforts is the frequent loneliness of the worshipper of wealth. He is one, and he has no companion, no partner or friend, often none bound to him by ties of blood, child or brother, yet he labours on, as though he meant to be the founder of a dynasty. “He heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them” <a href="/psalms/39-6.htm" title="Surely every man walks in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heaps up riches, and knows not who shall gather them.">Psalm 39:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither is his eye satisfied with riches</span>] The words paint vividly the special characteristic of the insatiability of avarice,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“So grows our love of wealth as grows the wealth itself.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither saith he, For whom do I labour</span>] The words in italics <span class="bld">“saith he”</span> express the meaning of the original but deprive it of its dramatic boldness. The speaker imagines himself in the place of the miser and this is the question which in that case he would ask. The picture is, as it were, a <span class="ital">replica</span> of that already drawn in chap. <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm" title="Yes, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me....">Ecclesiastes 2:18-19</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is one alone, and there is not a second</span>; or, <span class="accented">without a second</span> - a solitary being, without partner, relation, or friend. Here, he says, is another instance of man's inability to secure his own happiness. Wealth indeed, is supposed to make friends, such as they are; but miserliness and greed separate a man from his fellows, make him suspicious of every one, and drive him to live alone, churlish and unhappy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he hath neither child nor brother</span>; no one to share his wealth, or for whom to save and amass riches. To apply these words to Solomon himself, who had brothers, and one son, if not more, is manifestly inappropriate. They may possibly refer to some circumstance in the writer's own life; but of that we know nothing. <span class="cmt_word">Yet is there no sad of all his labor</span>. In spite of this isolation he plies his weary task, and ceases not to hoard. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is his eye satisfied with riches</span>; so that he is content with what he has (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). The insatiable thirst for gold, the dropsy of the mind, is a commonplace theme in classical writers. Thus Horace, 'Caxm.,' 3:16. 17 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam, Majorumque fames."</span> And Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:138 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum turget sacculus ore,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crevit."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Neither, saith he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good?</span> The original is more dramatic than the Authorized Version or the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec recogitat</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>, <span class="accented">Cui laboro</span>, etc.? The writer suddenly puts himself in the place of the friendless miser, and exclaims, "And for whom do I labor," etc.? We see something similar in ver. 15 and <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>. Here we cannot find any definite allusion to the writer's own circumstances. The clause is merely a lively personification expressive of strong sympathy with the situation described (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>). <span class="accented">Good</span> may mean either riches, in which case the denial to the soul refers to the enjoyment which wealth might afford, or happiness and comfort. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "goodness," "kindness " - which gives quite a different and not so suitable an idea. <span class="cmt_word">Sore travail</span>; a sad business, a woeful employment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And I praised the dead who were long ago dead, more than the living who are yet in life; and as happier than both, him who has not yet come into existence, who hath not seen the evil work which is done under the sun." &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495; is hardly thought of as part., like &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1502;&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>; the m of the part.

Only the annexed designation of the subject is peculiar; the syntactic possibility of this connection is established by <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>, and, in the second rank, by <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14</a>. Yet &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; might well enough have been omitted had &#1493;&#1513; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1493;&#1488; not stood too remote. Regarding &#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1492; <p>(Note: Thus punctuated with Segol under Daleth, and ,&#1504; raphatum, in F. H. J. P. Thus also Kimchi in W.B. under &#1506;&#1491;.)<p>and &#1506;&#1491;&#1503;. The circumstantial form of the expression: prae vivis qui vivi sunt adhuc, is intentional: they who are as yet living must be witnesses of the manifold and comfortless human miseries.<p>It is a question whether <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a> begins a new clause (lxx, Syr., and Venet.) or not. That &#1488;&#1514;, like the Arab. aiya, sometimes serves to give prominence to the subject, cannot be denied (vid., Bttcher, 516, and Mhlau's remarks thereto). The Mishnic expressions &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, that day, &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468;, that land, and the like (Geiger, 14. 2), presuppose a certain preparation in the older language; and we might, with Weiss (Stud. ueber d. Spr. der Mishna, p. 112), interpret &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1514; in the sense of &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;, is qui. But the accus. rendering is more natural. Certainly the expression &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, "to praise," "to pronounce happy," is not used; but to &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; it is natural to suppose &#1493;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; added. Jerome accordingly translates: et feliciorem utroque judicavi qui necdum natus est. &#1492;&#1512;&#1506; has the double Kametz, as is generally the case, except at <a href="/psalms/54-7.htm">Psalm 54:7</a> and <a href="/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>.<p>(Note: Vid., Heidenheim, Meor Enajim, under <a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>.)<p>Better than he who is born is the unborn, who does not become conscious of the wicked actions that are done under the sun. A similar thought, with many variations in its expression, is found in Greek writers; see regarding these shrill discordances, which run through all the joy of the beauty and splendour of Hellenic life, my Apologetick, p. 116. Buddhism accordingly gives to nirvna the place of the highest good. That we find Koheleth on the same path (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>), has its reason in this, that so long as the central point of man's existence lies in the present life, and this is not viewed as the fore-court of eternity, there is no enduring consolation to lift us above the miseries of this present world. </body></html>
