It is possible, as has been suggested (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm" title="Yes, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me.">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>), that this may have been the writer’s own case. The following verses, which speak of the advantages of friendship and unity, are of a more cheerful tone than the rest of the book.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7,8 Frequently, the more men have, the more they would have; and on this they are so intent, that they get no enjoyment from what they have. Selfishness is the cause of this evil. A selfish man cares for nobody; there is none to take care of but himself, yet he will scarcely allow necessary rest to himself, and the people he employs. He never thinks he has enough. He has enough for his calling, for his family, but he has not enough for his eyes. Many are so set upon the world, that in pursuit of it they bereave themselves, not only of the favour of God and eternal life, but of the pleasures of this life. The distant relations or strangers who inherit such a man's wealth, never thank him. Covetousness gathers strength by time and habit; men tottering on the brink of the grave, grow more grasping and griping. Alas, and how often do we see men professing to be followers of Him, who, though he was rich, for our sakes became poor, anxiously scraping money together and holding it fast, excusing themselves by common-place talking about the necessity of care, and the danger of extravagance!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The spectacle of a prosperous man whose condition is rendered vain by his brotherless, childless isolation.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Incorrectly Hahn: And anew I saw, - the observation is different from that of <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>, though cognate. Thus: And again I saw, - the expression follows the syntactic scheme of <a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>; regarding the fut. consec. brought into view here and at <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:7</a>. The second &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473; is part. pass.; the first, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/35-9.htm">Job 35:9</a>, and also at <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>, is abstract (i.e., bringing the many separate instances under one general idea) pluraletantum (cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1497;, redemti, <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>; and redemtio, pretium redemtionis, <a href="/numbers/3-46.htm">Numbers 3:46</a>); the plur. &#1504;&#1506; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; need not appear strange, since even &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is connected with the plur. of the pred., e.g., <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514; has, as at <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), a collective sense. The expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1495; ... &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491; is singular. According to the most natural impression, it seems to signify: "and from the hand of their oppressors no power of deliverance" (carrying forward &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;); but the parallelism of the palindromically constructed verse (as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>) excludes this meaning. Thus &#1499;&#1468;&#1495; is here once-nowhere else-used, like the Greek &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, in the sense of violence; Luzzatto prefers the reading &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;, by which the expression would be in conformity with the linguistic usage; but also &#1502;&#1497;&#1491; is explained: the force which they have in their hands is, in going forth from their hands, thought of as abused, and, as taking the form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1491; or &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1492;. In view of this sorrow which men bring upon their fellow-men, life for Koheleth lost all its worth and attraction. </body></html>
