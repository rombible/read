The "threefold cord" [Ec 4:12] of social ties suggests the subject of civil government. In this case too, he concludes that kingly power confers no lasting happiness. The "wise" child, though a supposed case of Solomon, answers, in the event foreseen by the Holy Ghost, to Jeroboam, then a poor but valiant youth, once a "servant" of Solomon, and (1Ki 11:26-40) appointed by God through the prophet Ahijah to be heir of the kingdom of the ten tribes about to be rent from Rehoboam.

The wise man proceeds to show the vanity of worldly power and dignity, in the highest instance of it, which is kingly; and, in order to illustrate and exemplify this, he supposes, on the one hand, a person possessed of royal honour; who has long enjoyed it, is settled in his kingdom, and advanced in years; and who otherwise, for his gravity and dignity, would be venerable; but that he is foolish, a person of a mean genius and small capacity; has but little knowledge of government, or but little versed in the arts of it, though he has held the reins of it long in his hand; and, which is worst of all, is vicious and wicked: on the other hand, he supposes one that is in his tender years, not yet arrived to manhood; and so may be thought to be giddy and inexperienced, and therefore taken but little notice of; and especially being poor, becomes contemptible, as well as labours under the disadvantage of a poor education; his parents poor, and he not able to get books and masters to teach him knowledge; nor to travel abroad to see the world, and make his observations on men and things; and yet being wise, having a good genius, which he improves in the best manner he can, to his own profit, and to make himself useful in the world; and especially if he is wise and knowing in the best things, and fears God, and serves him; he is more happy, in his present state and circumstances, than the king before described is in his, and is fitter to take his place, and be a king, than he is; for though he is young, yet wise, and improving in knowledge, and willing to be advised and counselled by others, older and wiser than himself; he is much to be preferred to one that is old and foolish; <p>who will no more be admonished; or, "knows not to be admonished any more" (d): he neither knows how to give nor take advice; he is impatient of all counsel; cannot bear any admonition; is stubborn and self-willed, and resolved to take his own way. The Jews, in their Midrash, Jarchi, and others, interpret it, allegorically, of the good and evil imagination in men, the principle of grace, and the corruption of nature; the one is the new man, the other the old man; the new man is better than old Adam: the Targum applies it to Abraham and Nimrod; the former is the poor and wise child, that feared God, and worshipped him early; the latter, the old and foolish king, who was an idolater, and refused to be admonished of his idolatry; and so the Midrash. <p>(d)    "non novit moneri adhuc", Montanus; "nescit admoneri amplius", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Drusius, Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Better is a poor and a wise child</span>] Better, <span class="bld">young man.</span> The words are general enough but the ingenuity of commentators has sought for examples in history, which the writer, according to the varying theories as to his date, may have had in his thoughts. Such, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> as Abraham and Nimrod, Joseph and Pharaoh, David and Saul (all these are named in the <span class="ital">Midrash Koheleth</span>, see <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, ch. vi.), Joash and Amaziah, Cyrus and Astyages, the high priest Onias and his nephew Joseph (circ. b.c. 246–221, see Joseph. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. xii. 4, and Note on next verse), or Herod and his son Alexander. None of these identifications are altogether satisfactory, and it is quite possible that the writer may simply have uttered a general statement or may have had in view some events of which we have no record. In <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/4-8.htm" title="For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years....">Wis 4:8-9</a> we have a more eloquent utterance of the same thought, “Honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time or that is measured by number of years, but wisdom is the grey hair unto men and unspotted life is old age.” The word for “child” is used of Joseph at the age of 17 (<a href="/genesis/37-30.htm" title="And he returned to his brothers, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?">Genesis 37:30</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-20.htm" title="But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.">Genesis 42:20</a>) and even of the companions of Rehoboam when the latter was over 40 (<a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm" title="But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:">1 Kings 12:8</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-16.</span> - High place offers no assurance of security. A king's popularity is never permanent; he is supplanted by some clever young aspirant for a time, whose influence in turn soon evaporates, and the subject-people reap no benefit from the change. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king.</span> The word translated "child" (<span class="accented">yeled</span>), is used sometimes of one beyond childhood (see <a href="/genesis/30-26.htm">Genesis 30:26</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-30.htm">Genesis 37:30</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a>), so here it may be rendered "youth." <span class="accented">Misken</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> (Septuagint), <span class="accented">pauper</span> (Vulgate), "poor," is found also at <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:15, 16</a>, and nowhere else; but the root, with an analogous signification, occurs at <a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-20.htm">Isaiah 40:20</a>. The clause says that a youth who is clever and adroit, though sprung from a sordid origin, is better off than a king who has not learned wisdom with his years, and who, it is afterwards implied, is dethroned by this young man. <span class="cmt_word">Who will no more be admonished</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more</span>. Age has only fossilized his self-will and obstinacy; and though he was once open to advice and hearkened to reproof, he now bears no contradiction and takes no counsel. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "Who knows not how to take heed any longer;" which is perhaps similar to the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui nescit praevidere in posterum</span>, "Who knows not how to look forward to the future." The words will bear this translation, and it accords with one view of the author's meaning (see below); but that given above is more suitable to the interpretation of the paragraph which approves itself to us. The sentence is of general import, and may be illustrated by a passage from the Book of Wisdom (4. 8, 9), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by length of years. But wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age." So Cicero, 'De Senect.,' 18:62, "Non cant nee rugae repente auctoritatem arripere possunt, sod honeste acta superior aetas fructus capit aactoritatis extremes." Some have thought that Solomon is here speaking of himself, avowing his folly and expressing his contrition, in view of his knowledge of Jeroboam's delegation to the kingdom - the crafty youth of poor estate (<a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>, etc.), whom the Prophet Ahijah had warned of approaching greatness. But there is nothing in the recorded history of Solomon to make probable such expression of self-abasement, and our author could never have so completely misrepresented him. Here, too, is another proof that Ecclesiastes is not written by Solomon himself. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"There is one without a second, also son and brother he has not; and there is no end of his labour; his eyes nevertheless are not satisfied with riches: For whom do I labour, then, and deny all good to my soul? Also this is vain, and it is a sore trouble." That &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, as in <a href="/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>, has the meaning of &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, absque, Nolde has already observed in his Partik.-Concordanz: a solitarius, without one standing by his side, a second standing near him, i.e., without wife and without friend; also, as the words following show, without son and brother.

Gam may be interpreted in the sense of "also" as well as of "nevertheless" (Ewald, 354a); the latter is to be preferred, since the endless labour includes in itself a restless striving after an increase of possession. The Keri&#770;&lt;, in an awkward way, changes &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; into &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;; the taking together the two eyes as one would here be unnatural, since the avaricious man devours gold, silver, and precious things really with both his eyes, and yet, however great be his wealth, still more does he wish to see in his possession; the sing. of the pred. is as at <a href="/1_samuel/4-15.htm">1 Samuel 4:15</a>; <a href="/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>.<p>With ulmi ani, Koheleth puts himself in the place of such a friendless, childless man; yet this change of the description into a self-confession may be occasioned by this, that the author in his old age was really thus isolated, and stood alone.
