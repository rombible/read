Wherever we turn, we see melancholy proofs of the wickedness and misery of mankind, who try to create trouble to themselves and to each other. Being thus hardly used, men are tempted to hate and despise life. But a good man, though badly off while in this world, cannot have cause to wish he had never been born, since he is glorifying the Lord, even in the fires, and will be happy at last, for ever happy. Ungodly men have most cause to wish the continuance of life with all its vexations, as a far more miserable condition awaits them if they die in their sins.

A profane sentiment if severed from its connection; but just in its bearing on Solomon's scope. If religion were not taken into account (Ec 3:17, 19), to die as soon as possible would be desirable, so as not to suffer or witness "oppressions"; and still more so, not to be born at all (Ec 7:1). Job (Job 3:12; 21:7), David (Ps 73:3, &c.), Jeremiah (Jer 12:1), Habakkuk (Hab 1:13), all passed through the same perplexity, until they went into the sanctuary, and looked beyond the present to the "judgment" (Ps 73:17; Hab 2:20; 3:17, 18). Then they saw the need of delay, before completely punishing the wicked, to give space for repentance, or else for accumulation of wrath (Ro 2:15); and before completely rewarding the godly, to give room for faith and perseverance in tribulation (Ps 92:7-12). Earnests, however, are often even now given, by partial judgments of the future, to assure us, in spite of difficulties, that God governs the earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I praised; </span> I judged them more happy, or less miserable; which he seems to deliver not only as the judgment of the flesh, or of the sense, or of men in misery, as this is commonly understood, but as his own judgment. For this is most true and certain, that setting aside the advantage which this life gives him for the concerns of the future life, which Solomon doth not meddle with in the present debate, and considering the uncertainty, and vanity, and manifold vexations of mind, and outward calamities of the present life, a wise man would not account it worth his while to live, and would choose death rather than life. <span class="ital">The dead which are already dead</span>; those which are quite dead; who possibly are here opposed to them that, in respect of their deplorable and desperate condition, are even whilst they live called dead men, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm" title="Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.

Truly and properly so; not in a figurative sense, as dead sinners, men dead in trespasses and sins; nor carnal professors, that have a name to live, and are dead; nor in a civil sense, such as are in calamity and distress, as the Jews in captivity, or in any affliction, which is sometimes called death: but such who are dead in a literal and natural sense, really and thoroughly dead; not who may and will certainly die, but who are dead already and in their graves, and not all these; not the wicked dead, who are in hell, in everlasting torments; but the righteous dead, who are taken away from the evil to come, and are free from all the oppressions of their enemies, sin, Satan, and the world. The Targum is, <p>"I praised those that lie down or are asleep, who, behold, are now dead;'' <p>a figure by which death is often expressed, both in the Old and New Testament; sleep being, as the poet (a) says, the image of death; and a great likeness there is between them; Homer (b) calls sleep and death twins. The same paraphrase adds, <p>"and see not the vengeance which comes upon the world after their death;'' <p>see <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>. The wise man did not make panegyrics or encomiums on those persons, but he pronounced them happy; he judged them in his own mind to be so; and to be much <p>more happy <p>than the living which are yet alive: that live under the oppression of others; that live in this world in trouble until now, as the Targum; of whom it is as much as it can be said that they are alive; they are just alive, and that is all; they are as it were between life and death. This is generally understood as spoken according to human sense, and the judgment of the flesh, without any regard to the glory and happiness of the future state; that the dead must be preferred to the living, when the quiet of the one, and the misery of the other, are observed; and which sense receives confirmation from <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>, otherwise it is a great truth, that the righteous dead, who die in Christ and are with him, are much more happy than living saints; since they are freed from sin; are out of the reach of Satan's temptations; are no more liable to darkness and desertions; are freed from all doubts and fears; cease from all their labours, toil, and trouble; and are delivered from all afflictions, persecutions, and oppressions; which is not the case of living saints: and besides, the joys which they possess, the company they are always in, and the work they are employed about, give them infinitely the preference to all on earth; see <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>. <p>(a) "Stulte, quid est semnus gelidae nisi mortis imago?"

Regarding &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489; for the sake of  equals  on account of as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>, vid., under <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where it signifies after (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;) the state of the matter. The infin. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468; is not derived from &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;. - &#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>, is only the metaplastic form of &#1500;&#1489;&#1512; or &#1500;&#1489;&#1512;&#1512; - but only from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, whose infin. may take the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, after the form &#1512;&#1491;, to tread down, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, to bow, <a href="/jeremiah/5-26.htm">Jeremiah 5:26</a>; but nowhere else is this infin. form found connected with a suff.; &#1511;&#1495;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-3.htm">Hosea 11:3</a>, would be in some measure to be compared, if it could be supposed that this  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, sumendo eos. The root &#1489;&#1512; proceeds, from the primary idea of cutting, on the one side to the idea of separating, winnowing, choosing out; and, on the other, to that of smoothing, polishing, purifying (vid., under <a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>). Here, by the connection, the meaning of winnowing, i.e., of separating the good from the bad, is intended, with which, however, as in &#1500;&#1489;&#1512;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>, the meaning of making clear, making light, bringing forward into the light, easily connects itself (cf. Shabbath 138a, 74a), of which the meaning to winnow (cf. &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1512;, <a href="/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a>) is only a particular form; <p>(Note: Not "to sift," for not &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512; but &#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;, means "to sift" (properly, "to make to keep up," "to agitate"); cf. Shebith v. 9.)<p>cf. Sanhedrin 7b: "when a matter is clear, brwr, to thee (free from ambiguity) as the morning, speak it out; and if not, do not speak it."<p>In the expression &#1500;&#1489; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, the word &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; is, without doubt, the subject, according to Gesen. 133. 2. 3; Hitz. regards &#1492;&#1488;&#1500; as genit., which, judged according to the Arab., is correct; it is true that for li-imti-h&#803;a&#770;nihim allahi (with genit. of the subj.), also allahu (with nominat. of the subj.) may be used; but the former expression is the more regular and more common (vid., Ewald's Gramm. Arab. 649), but not always equally decisive with reference to the Heb. usus loq. That God delays His righteous interference till the time appointed beforehand, is for the sake of the children of men, with the intention, viz., that God may sift them, i.e., that, without breaking in upon the free development of their characters before the time, He may permit the distinction between the good and the bad to become manifest. Men, who are the obj. to &#1500;&#1489;, are the subject to &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; to be supplied: et ut videant; it is unnecessary, with the lxx, Syr., and Jerome, to read &#1493;&#1500;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; ( equals  &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1512;): ut ostenderet. It is a question whether &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; <p>(Note: &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; thus accented rightly in F. Cf. Michlol 216a.)<p>is the expression of the copula: sunt (sint), or whether he&#772;mmah lahe&#780;m is a closer definition, co-ordinate with shehem behe&#772;mah. The remark of Hitzig, that lahe&#780;m throws back the action on the subject, is not clear. Does he suppose that lahem belongs to liroth? That is here impossible. If we look away from lahem, the needlessly circumstantial expression &#1492;&#1501; ... &#1513;&#1492; can still be easily understood: hemmah takes up, as an echo, behemah, and completes the comparison (compare the battology in <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>). This play upon words musically accompanying the thought remains also, when, according to the accentuation &#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1489;&#1492;&#1501; &#1492; &#1500;&#1492;, we take hemmah along with lahem, and the former as well as the latter of these two words is then better understood. The &#1500; in &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; is not that of the pure dat. (Aben Ezra: They are like beasts to themselves, i.e., in their own estimation), but that of reference, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>, "as for Ishmael;" cf. <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-7.htm">2 Kings 5:7</a>; cf. &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-27.htm">1 Samuel 1:27</a>, etc. Men shall see that they are cattle (beasts), they in reference to themselves, i.e., either they in reference to themselves mutually (Luther: among themselves), or: they in reference to themselves. To interpret the reference as that of mutual relation, would, in looking back to <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>, commend itself, for the condemnation and oppression of the innocent under the appearance of justice is an act of human brutishness. But the reason assigned in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a> does not accord with this reciprocal rendering of lahem. Thus lahem will be meant reflexively, but it is not on that account pleonastic (Knobel), nor does it ironically form a climax: ipsissimi  equals  hchstselbst (Ewald, 315a); but "they in reference to themselves" is  equals  they in and of themselves, i.e., viewed as men (viewed naturally). If one disregards the idea of God's interfering at a future time with the discordant human history, and, in general, if one loses sight of God, the distinction between the life of man and of beast disappears. </body></html>
