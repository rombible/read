I am inclined to think that the Preacher reverts to the general topic, and considered all the living with the “second youth,” <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the second generation which shall succeed them.

Probably Solomon observed this disposition in his own people, who were growing weary of his government, and beginning to desire a change, and to turn their eyes to Rehoboam his successor. At least he remembered the rebellion that had been raised against his father David in favour of Absalom, and might have reason to think the same leaven was still working in his kingdom. The verse is thus paraphrased by Bishop Patrick: “Such is the infelicity of princes, that I have seen a king left with nothing but the bare title, and the outward state of royalty; the hearts and affections of all, nobles, gentry, and common people, from one end of the kingdom to the other, inclining to his son (or next heir) that is to succeed him; unto whom they do obeisance, as if he were already upon the throne; but neglect his old father, who sees himself robbed of those honours in which he placed his happiness.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-16 People are never long easy and satisfied; they are fond of changes.

All men that were then alive, who were capable of walking upon the earth; even all of them that were under the heavens, in every land and nation, under whatsoever dominion or government: these, and their manners, Solomon had particularly observed, and made his remarks upon, by which it appeared how fickle the minds of the populace were under every government, and how precarious and uncertain were the honour and dignity of princes; <p>with the second child that shall stand up in his stead: the heir and successor or every prince, that shall rise up and take the throne of his father or predecessor, and reign in his stead. The wise man observed how the people commonly behaved towards him; how that they generally stood best affected to him, than to the reigning prince; worshipped the rising sun, courted his favour and friendship, soothed and flattered him; expressing their wishes to see him on the throne, and treated with neglect and contempt their lawful sovereign. Some, contrary to the accents, connect this with the word "walk" (h); that walk with the second child, join themselves to him, converse with him, and show him great respect and honour: and there are others that, by this second child, understand the poor and wise child, that succeeds the old and foolish king, whom yet, in time, the people grow weary of; such is the levity and inconstancy of people, that they are not long pleased with princes, old or young, wise or foolish. The Targum interprets this of the foresight Solomon had, by a spirit of prophecy, of those that rebelled against his son Rehoboam, and of those that cleaved unto him, who was his second, and reigned in his stead. Noldius (i) thinks Solomon refers to the history of his friend Hiram, king of Tyre, whose kingdom, in his and in his son's time, was very large, flourishing, and opulent, but in a following reign not so; and he renders and paraphrases the words thus, <p>""I saw all the works under the sun; with Baleazarus, the son of a friend" (Hiram, for  rendered "second", is the same as  "a friend"), "who shall stand" or "reign after him: there is no end of all the people",'' &amp;c. <p>the kingdom in those two reigns being flourishing; yet posterity shall not rejoice in him, in Abdastratus, the grandson of Hiram, destroyed by the four sons of his nurse (k). <p>(h) So the Tigurine version, Vatablus, Cocceius, Gejerus.

The expression is hyperbolical, as Eastern monarchs speak of their dominions as if they comprised the whole world (see <a href="/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span> "With" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) means "in company with," "on the side of;" and the clause should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">That they were with the youth</span>, <span class="accented">the second</span>, <span class="accented">that stood up in his stead</span>.

The good reward consists in this, that each one of the two has the pleasant consciousness of doing good to the other by his labour, and especially of being helpful to him.
