But idleness is a sin that is its own punishment.

The pains that men take to do right works. Some apply themselves, with great diligence and industry, to the study of the liberal arts and sciences; and to attain the knowledge of languages; and to writing books, for the improvement of those things, and the good of mankind: and others employ themselves in mechanic arts, and excel in them, and bring their works to great perfection and accuracy; when they might expect to be praised and commended, and have thanks given them by men. But instead thereof, so it is, <p>that for this a man is envied of his neighbour; who will be sure to find fault with what he has done, speak contemptibly of him and his work, and traduce him among men. This is also true of moral works; which are right, when done from a right principle, from love to God, in faith, and with a view to the glory of God; and which when done, and ever so well done, draw upon a man the envy of the wicked, as may be observed in the case of Cain and Abel, <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>; though some understand this, not passively, of the envy which is brought upon a man, and he endures, for the sake of the good he excels in; but actively, of the spirit of emulation with which he does it; though the work he does, as to the matter of it, is right; yet the manner of doing it, and the spirit with which he does it, are wrong; he does not do it with any good affection to the thing itself, nor with any good design, only from a spirit of emulation to outdo his neighbour: so the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"this is the emulation that a man emulates his neighbour, to do as he; if he emulates him to do good, the heavenly Word does good to him; but if he emulates him to do evil, the heavenly Word does evil to him;'' <p>and to this sense Jarchi; compare with this, <a href="/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15</a>. <p>This is also vanity, and vexation of spirit; whether it be understood in the one sense or the other; how dissatisfying and vexatious is it, when a man has taken a great deal of pains to do right works for public good, instead of having thanks and praise, is reproached and calumniated for it? and if he does a right thing, and yet has not right ends and views in it, it stands for nothing; it has only the appearance of good, but is not truly so, and yields no solid peace and comfort. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Again, I considered all labour, and every <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbour.

The word rendered "right" is <span class="accented">kishron</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 2:21), and means rather "dexterity," "success." Kohe-leth says that he reflected upon the industry that men exhibit, and the skill and dexterity with which they ply their incessant toil. There is no reference to moral rectitude in the reflection, and the allusion to the ostracism of Aristides for being called "Just" overshoots the mark (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.).

The Septuagint is ambiguous, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "That this is a man's envy from his comrade;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Industrias animadverti patere invidiae proximi</span>, "Lay open to a neighbor's envy." In the first case the thought is that unusual skill and success expose a man to envy and ill will, which rob labor of all enjoyment. In the second case the writer says that this superiority and dexterity arise from a mean motive, an envious desire to outstrip a neighbor, and, based on such low ground, can lead to nothing but <span class="cmt_word">vanity and vexation of spirit</span>, a striving after wind. The former explanation seems more in accordance with Koheleth's gloomy view. Success itself is no guarantee of happiness; the malice and ill feeling which it invariably occasions are necessarily a source of pain and distress. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"All goes hence to one place; all has sprung out of the dust, and all returns to the dust again." The "one place" is (as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>) the earth, the great graveyard which finally receives all the living when dead. The art. of the first &#1492;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512; is that denoting species; the art. of the second is retrospective: to the dust whence he sprang (cf. <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>); otherwise, <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a> (cf. <a href="/job/34-15.htm">Job 34:15</a>), "to dust shalt thou return," shalt become dust again. From dust to dust (Sir. 40:11; 41:10) is true of every living corporeal thing. It is true there exists the possibility that with the spirit of the dying man it may be different from what it is with the spirit of the dying beast, but yet that is open to question. </body></html>
