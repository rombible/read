The sun rises in the morning and sets at evening in our hemisphere, according to the appearance of things; and then it makes haste to go round the other hemisphere in the night: it "pants", as the word (t) signifies; the same figure is used by other writers (u); like a man out of breath with running; so this glorious body, which rejoiceth as a strong man to run his race, and whose circuit is from one end of the heavens to the other, <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>; is in haste to get to the place where he rose in the morning, and there he makes no stop, but pursues his course in the same track again. By this instance is exemplified the succession of the generations of men one after another, as the rising and setting of the sun continually follows each other; and also sets forth the restless state of things in the world, which, like the sun, are never at a stand, but always moving, and swiftly taking their course; and likewise the changeable state of man, who, like the rising sun, and when at noon day, is in flourishing circumstances, and in the height of prosperity, but as this declines and sets, so he has his declining times and days of adversity. Moreover, like the rising sun, he comes into this world and appears for a while, and then, like the setting sun, he dies; only with this difference, in which the sun has the preference to him, as the earth before had; the sun hastens and comes to its place from whence it arose, but man lies down and rises not again till the heavens be no more, and never returns to his place in this world, that knows him no more, <a href="/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a>.

We are reminded of the Rabbinic legend of Abraham’s looking on the sun, and, when half tempted to adore it, repressing the temptation by watching its going down and saying “The God whom I worship must be a God that does not set.” Koran, <span class="ital">Sur.</span> 6.

Lect. 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hasteth to his place where he arose</span>] The primary meaning of the first of the two verbs is that of the panting of one who travels quickly. Here again we have to think of the belief that, between the sunset and the sunrise, the sun had a long journey to perform, as the Greeks thought, by the great Ocean river, till it returned to the point where it had risen the day before. Possibly the clouds and mists of the morning were thought of as the panting of the sun, as of “the strong man” who “runs his race” (<a href="/psalms/19-5.htm" title="Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.">Psalm 19:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Parallels present themselves in <a href="/psalms/19-5.htm" title="Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.">Psalm 19:5</a> (“rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race”) and yet more strikingly in Virgil, <span class="ital">Georg</span>. i. 250,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nosque ubi primus equis Oriens adflavit anhelis,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Illic sera rubens accendit lumina Vesper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“And when to us the sun with panting steeds<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hastens at dawn, far off the star of eve<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There lights her glowing lamp.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Comp. also <span class="ital">Æn</span>. xii. 113.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down</span>. The sun is another instance of ever-recurring change in the face of an enduring sameness, rising and setting day-by-day, and resting never. The legendary 'Life of Abram' relates how, having been hidden for some years in a cave in order to escape the search of Nimrod, when he emerged from his concealment, and for the first time beheld heaven and earth, he began to inquire who was the Creator of the wonders around him. When the sun arose and flooded the scene with its glorious light, he at once concluded that that bright orb must be the creative Deity, and offered his prayers to it all day long. But when it sank in darkness, he repented of his illusion, being persuaded that the sun could not have made the world and be itself subject to extinction (see 'Abraham: his Life and Times,' p. 12). <span class="cmt_word">And hasteth to his place where he arose;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and panteth</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">hasteth</span>, <span class="accented">longeth to go</span>) <span class="accented">to its place arising there</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sun, sinking in the west, eagerly during the night returns to the east, duly to rise there in the morning. The "place" is the region of reappearance. The Septuagint gives, "The sun arises, and the sun sets, and draws (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) unto its place;" and then carries the idea into the following verse: "Arising there, it proceedeth southward," etc. The Vulgate supports the rendering; but there is no doubt that the Authorized Version gives substantially the sense of the Hebrew text as accentuated. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">shaaph</span>), as Delitzsch shows, implies "punting," not from fatigue, but in eager pursuit of something; and all notions of panting steeds or morning exhalations are quite foreign from the conception of the passage. The notion which Koheleth desires to convey is that the sun makes no real progress; its eager punting merely brings it to the old place, there to recommence its monotonous routine. Rosenm&uuml;ller quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 5:4-6, on which, Doering cites Lotich., 'Eleg.,' 3:7. 23 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ergo ubi permensus coelum sol occidit, idem<br />Purpureo vestit lumine rursus humum;<br />Nos, ubi decidimus, defuncti muncre vitae,<br />Urget perpetua hmina nocte sopor."</span> But our passage does not contrast the revival of the sun every morning with man's eternal sleep in death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/proverbs/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What now follows is not a continuation of the husband's words of praise (Ewald, Elster, Lwenstein), but an epiphonema auctoris (Schultens); the poet confirms the praise of the husband by referring it to the general ground of its reason:<p>30 &#1513; Grace is deceit; and beauty, vanity - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wife that feareth Jahve, she shall be praised.<p>Grace is deceit, because he who estimates the works of a wife merely by the loveliness of her external appearance, is deceived by it; and beauty is vanity, vanitas, because it is nothing that remains, nothing that is real, but is subject to the law of all material things - transitoriness. The true value of a wife is measured only by that which is enduring, according to the moral background of its external appearance; according to the piety which makes itself manifest when the beauty of bodily form has faded away, in a beauty which is attractive.<p>(Note: Vid., the application of <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a> in Taanith 26b: "Young man," say the maidens, "lift up thine eyes and behold that which thou choosest for thyself! Direct thine eyes not to beauty (&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;), direct thine eyes to the family (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1495;&#1492;); pleasantness is a deception, etc.")<p>&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; (with Makkeph following),<p>(Note: The writing &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470; is that of Ben Asher, &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; that of Ben Naphtali; Norzi, from a misunderstanding, claims &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470; (with Gaja) as Ben Asher's manner of writing.)<p>is here the connective form of &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (fem. of &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;). The Hithpa. &#1514;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; is here manifestly (<a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>) not reflexive, but representative of the passive (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/12-8.htm">Proverbs 12:8</a>, and the frequently occurring &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, laudatus  equals  laudandus), nowhere occurring except in the passage before us. In itself the fut. may also mean: she will be praised  equals  is worthy of praise, but the jussive rendering (Luther: Let her be praised) is recommended by the verse which follows: </body></html>
