By subterraneous cavities, and by evaporation forming rain clouds, the fountains and rivers are supplied from the sea, into which they then flow back. The connection is: Individual men are continually changing, while the succession of the race continues; just as the sun, wind, and rivers are ever shifting about, while the cycle in which they move is invariable; they return to the point whence they set out. Hence is man, as in these objects of nature which are his analogue, with all the seeming changes "there is no new thing" (Ec 1:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is not full, </span> to wit, to the brink, or so as to overflow the earth, which might be expected from such vast accessions to it; whereby also he intimates the emptiness and dissatisfaction of men’s minds, not withstanding all the abundance of creature-comforts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the place from whence the rivers come; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Which flow from fountains or an formed by hasty rains; these make their way to the sea, yet the sea is not filled therewith, and made to abound and overflow the earth, as it might be expected it would. So Seneca says (z) we wonder that the accession of rivers is not perceived in the sea; and Lucretius (a) observes the same, that it is wondered at that the sea should not increase, when there is such a flow of waters to it from all quarters; besides the wandering showers and flying storms that fall into it, and yet scarce increased a drop; which he accounts for by the exhalations of the sun, by sweeping and drying winds, and by what the clouds take up. Homer (b) makes every sea, all the rivers, fountains, and wells, flow, from the main ocean. Hence Pindar (c) calls the lake or fountain Camarina the daughter of the ocean But Virgil (d) makes the rivers to flow into it, as the wise man here; with which Aristotle (e) agrees. So Lactantius (f) says, "mare quod ex fluminibus constat", the sea consists of rivers. Both may be true, for, through secret passages under ground, the waters of it are caused to pass back again to their respective places from whence they flowed, as follows; <p>unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again; this also illustrates the succession of men, age after age, and the revolution of things in the world, their unquiet and unsettled state; and the unsatisfying nature of all things; as the sea is never full with what comes into it, so the mind of man is never satisfied with all the riches and honour he gains, or the knowledge of natural things he acquires; and it suggests that even water, as fluctuating a body as it is, yet has the advantage of men; that though it is always flowing and reflowing, yet it returns to its original place, which man does not. And from all these instances it appears that all things are vanity, and man has no profit of all his labour under the sun. <p>(z) Nat. Quaest. l. 3. c. 4. (a) De Rerum Natura, l. 6.

It may be questioned, however, whether that theory, which Lucretius states almost as if it were a discovery, were present to the mind of the <span class="bld">Debater</span> and whether he did not rather think of the waters of the ocean filtering through the crevices of the earth and so feeding its wells and fountains. The Epicurean poet himself accepts this as a partial solution of phenomena, and on the view taken in the <span class="ital">Introduction</span> as to the date of <span class="ital">Ecclesiastes</span> it may well have been known to the author as one of the physical theories of the school of Epicurus. We can scarcely fail, at any rate, to be struck with the close parallelism of expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Postremo quoniam raro cum corpore tellus<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Est, et conjuncta est, oras maris undique cingens,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Debet, ut in mare de terris venit umor aquai,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In terras itidem manare ex aequore salso;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Percolatur enim virus, retroque remanat<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Materies humoris, et ad caput amnibus omnis<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Confluit; inde super terras redit agmine dulci.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Lastly since earth has open pores and rare,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And borders on the sea, and girds its shores,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Need must its waters, as from earth to sea<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They flow, flow back again from sea to earth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so the brackish taint is filtered off<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And to the source the water back distils,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And from fresh fountains streams o’er all the fields.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lucret. vi. 631–637.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The same thought is found in Homer, <span class="ital">Il.</span> xxi. 96,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Ocean’s strength<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From which all rivers flow,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and is definitely stated in the Chaldee paraphrase of the verse now before us.

Doubtless the idea is general, and such as would strike every observer, however little he might trouble himself with the reason of the circumstance (comp. Ecclus. 40:11). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again;</span> rather, <span class="accented">unto the place whither the rivers go</span>, <span class="accented">thither they go again</span>. As Wright and Delitzsch observe, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> after verbs of motion has often the signification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; and the idea is that the streams continue to make their way into the sea with ceaseless iteration. The other rendering, which is supported by the Vulgate <span class="accented">undo</span>, seems rather to favor the Epicurean poet's solution of the phenomenon. Lucretius, in the passage cited above, explains that the amount of water contributed by rivers is a mere drop in the ocean; that a vast quantity rises in exhalations and is spread far and wide over the earth; and that another large portion finds its way back through the pores of the ground to the bed of the sea. Plumptre considers that this theory was known to Koheleth, and was introduced by him here. The rendering which we have given above would make this opinion untenable; it likewise excludes the idea (though that, indeed, may have been entertained by the Hebrews, <a href="/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a> and <a href="/proverbs/8-28.htm">Proverbs 8:28</a>) of the clouds being produced by the sea and feeding the springs. Thus Ecclus. 40:11, "All things that are of the earth do turn to the earth again; and that which is of the waters doth return into the sea." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The title, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>, The words of Koheleth, son of David, king in Jerusalem, has been already explained in the Introduction. The verse, which does not admit of being properly halved, is rightly divided by "son of David" by the accent Zakef; for the apposition, "king in Jerusalem," does not belong to "David," but to "Koheleth." In several similar cases, such as <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, the accentuation leaves the designation of the oppositional genitive undefined; in <a href="/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a> it proceeds on an erroneous supposition; it is rightly defined in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>, for example, as in the passage before us. That "king" is without the article, is explained from this, that it is determined by "in Jerusalem," as elsewhere by "of Israel" ("Judah"). The expression (cf. <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>) is singular. </body></html>
