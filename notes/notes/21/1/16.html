He could neither gain that satisfaction to himself, nor do that good to others, which he expected. Even the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom discovered man's wickedness and misery; so that the more he knew, the more he saw cause to lament and mourn.

That is, looked into it, examined it, and considered what a stock and fund of knowledge he had in it, after all his researches into it; what happiness accrued to him by it, and what judgment upon the whole was to be formed upon it; and he spoke within himself after this manner: <p>saying, lo, I am come to great estate; or become a great man; famous for wisdom, arrived to a very great pitch of it; greatly increased in it, through a diligent application to it; <p>and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem; or, "that before me were over Jerusalem" (p); governors of it, or in it; not only than the Jebusites, but than Saul, the first king of Israel, or than even his father David; or, as Gussetius (q), than any princes, rulers, and civil magistrates in Jerusalem, in his own days or in the days of his father; and also than all the priests and prophets, as well as princes, that ever had been there: and indeed he was wiser than all men, <a href="/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>; and even than any that had been in Jerusalem, or any where else, or that should be hereafter, excepting the Messiah; see <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>. And seeing this is said of him by others, and even by the Lord himself, it might not only be said with truth by himself, but without ostentation; seeing it was necessary it should be said to answer his purpose, which was to show the vanity of human wisdom in its highest pitch; and it was nowhere to be found higher than in himself; <p>yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge; or, "saw much wisdom and knowledge" (r); he thoroughly understood it, he was a complete master of it; it was not a superficial knowledge he had attained unto, or a few lessons of it he had committed to memory; some slight notions in his head, or scraps of things he had collected together, in an undigested manner; but he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with everything worthy to be known, and had digested it in his mind. <p>(p)  "super Jerusalaim", Montanus, Cocceius, Schmidt; "qui praefueriut ante me Jeruscthalamis", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

The verb in the Hebrew is connected closely with what follows and speaks not of outward majesty but of “becoming great,” in wisdom. So taken we may read, “<span class="bld">I became great and increased in wisdom more than all.</span>” We note again, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm" title="And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>, the kind of dialogue which the <span class="bld">Debater</span> holds with his inner consciousness. He “communes with his heart” (comp. <a href="/psalms/4-4.htm" title="Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.">Psalm 4:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-6.htm" title="I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.">Psalm 77:6</a>).

The historical Solomon, it is said, had but one predecessor over Jerusalem. The inference is, however, scarcely conclusive. Even on the theory of personated authorship, the writer would scarcely have slipped into so glaring an anachronism, and the words admit of being referred, on either view, either to the line of unknown Jebusite rulers, including perhaps Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm" title="And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.">Genesis 14:18</a>), Adonizedek (<a href="/joshua/15-63.htm" title="As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm" title="Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.">2 Samuel 5:7</a>) and others, or to the sages “Ethan the Ezrahite and Heman and Chalcol and Darda the sons of Mahol,” who are named in <a href="/1_kings/4-31.htm" title="For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.">1 Kings 4:31</a>, and who may, in some sense, as teachers and guides, have been “over” as well as “in” Jerusalem. Some MSS. indeed give the preposition “in” instead of “over.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my heart had great experience</span>] More literally, and at the same time more poetically, <span class="bld">my heart hath seen much wisdom and knowledge.</span> The two nouns are related, like the Greek <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστημὴ</span>, the former expressing the ethical, the latter the speculative, scientific side of knowledge.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Koheleth now arrives at his first conclusion, that wisdom is vanity. <span class="cmt_word">I communed with mine own heart</span>.

Who are the rulers alluded to? Solomon himself was only the second of the Israelite kings who reigned there; of the Canaanite princes who may have made that their capital, we have no knowledge, nor is R likely that Solomon would compare himself with them. The Targum has altered the approved reading, and gives, "Above all the wise men that were in Jerusalem before me." The reading, "in [instead of 'over'] Jerusalem," has indeed some manuscript authority, and is confirmed by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac, but it is evidently a correction of the text by critics who saw the difficulty of the authorized wording. Motais and others assert that the preposition in the Masoretic text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">all</span>, often means "in," as well as "over," when the reference is to an elevated spot; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>. But even granting this, we are still uncertain who are the persons meant. Commentators point to Melchizedek, Adonizedek, and Araunah among rulers, and to Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda (<a href="/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>) among sages. But we know nothing of the wisdom of the former, and there is no tangible reason why the latter should be designated "before me in Jerusalem." Doubtless the words point to a succession of kings who had reigned in Jerusalem, and the writer, involuntarily, perhaps, betrays his assumed character, in relying an excusable anachronism, while giving to the personated monarch a position which could not belong to the historical Solomon. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, my heart had great experience of</span> (<span class="accented">hath seen abundantly</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;</span> Venetian) <span class="cmt_word">wisdom and knowledge</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> used adverbially qualifies the word before it, "hath seen." The heart, as we have observed (ver. 13), is considered the seat of the intellectual life. In saying that the heart hath seen wisdom, the writer means that his mind has taken it in, apprehended and appropriated it (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>; <a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>). <span class="accented">Wisdom and knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">chokmah</span> and <span class="accented">daath</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint), the former regarding the ethical and practical side, the latter the speculative, which leads to the other (comp. <a href="/isaiah/33-6.htm">Isaiah 33:6</a>; <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Is there anything whereof it may be said: See, this is new? - it was long ago through the ages (aeons) which have been before us."
