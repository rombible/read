He then shows that the utmost perfection at which our wisdom can arrive in this world, consists, 1st, In being contented with this order in which God hath placed all things, and not disquieting ourselves about that which it is not in our power to alter. 2d, In observing and taking the fittest opportunity of doing every thing, as the most certain means to tranquillity. 3d, In taking the comfort of what we have at present, and making a seasonable and legitimate use of it; and, lastly, in bearing the vicissitudes which we find in all human things with an equal mind; because they are ordered by a powerful, wise, and gracious Providence. These were the things he had suggested in the conclusion of the former chapter, and this may be considered as having a relation to every one of them. See Bishop Patrick. <span class="ital">There is a season </span>— A certain time appointed by God for its being and continuance, which no human wisdom or providence can alter.

God allows man to enjoy moderately and virtuously His earthly gifts (Ec 3:12, 13). What consoles us amidst the instability of earthly blessings is, God's counsels are immutable (Ec 3:14).<p>1.

God does not condemn, but approves of, the use of earthly blessings (Ec 3:12); it is the abuse that He condemns, the making them the chief end (1Co 7:31). The earth, without human desires, love, taste, joy, sorrow, would be a dreary waste, without water; but, on the other hand, the misplacing and excess of them, as of a flood, need control.

A set determined time, when everything shall come into being, how long it shall continue, and in what circumstances; all things that have been, are, or shall be, were foreordained by God, and he has determined the times before appointed for their being, duration, and end; which times and seasons he has in his own power: there was a determined time for the whole universe, and for all persons and things in it; a settled fixed moment for the world to come into being; for it did not exist from everlasting, nor of itself, nor was formed by the fortuitous concourse of atoms, but by the wisdom and power of God; nor could it exist sooner or later than it did; it appeared when it was the will of God it should; in the beginning he created it, and he has fixed the time of its duration and end; for it shall not continue always, but have an end, which when it will be, he only knows: so there is a determined time for the rise, height, and declension of states and kingdoms in it; as of lesser ones, so of the four great monarchies; and for all the distinct periods and ages of the world; and for each of the seasons of the year throughout all ages; for the state of the church in it, whether in suffering or flourishing circumstances; for the treading down of the holy city; for the prophesying, slaying, and rising of the witnesses; for the reign and ruin of antichrist; for the reign of Christ on earth, and for his second coming to judgment, though of that day and hour knows no man: and as there is a set time in the counsels and providence of God for these more important events, so for every thing of a lesser nature; <p>and a time to every purpose under the heaven; to every purpose of man that is carried into execution; for some are not, they are superseded by the counsel of God; some obstruction or another is thrown in the way of them, so that they cannot take place; God withdraws men from them by affliction or death, when their purposes are broken; or by some other way; and what are executed he appoints a time for them, and overrules them to answer some ends of his own; for things the most contingent, free, and voluntary, fall under the direction and providence of God. And there is a time for every purpose of his own; all things done in the world are according to his purposes, which are within himself wisely formed, and are eternal and unfrustrable; and there is a time fixed for the execution of them, for every purpose respecting all natural and civil things in providence; and for every purpose of his grace, relating to the redemption of his people, the effectual calling of them, and the bringing them to eternal glory; which are the things that God wills, that he takes delight and pleasure in, as the word (e) signifies. The Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions render it, "to everything under the heaven there is a time"; and Jarchi observes that in the Misnic language the word used so signifies. The Targum is, <p>"to every man a time shall come, and a season to every business under heaven.'' <p>(e)  "omni voluntati", Montanus, Mercerus, Cocceius; i.e. "rei proprie capitae ac desideratae", Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To every <i>thing there is</i> a <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</span><p>(a) He speaks of this diversity of time for two causes first to declare that there is nothing in this world perpetual: next to teach us not to be grieved, if we have not all things at once according to our desires, neither enjoy them so long as we would wish.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose</span>] The two Hebrew nouns stand to each other in much the same relation as the Greek <span class="greekheb">χρόνος</span> and <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span>, the former expressing a period of duration, the latter the appointed time at which an event happens. Accepting this view, the words “season” and “time” in the A. V. ought, perhaps, to change places. The thought is one of which we find an echo in the maxim of Pittacus, <span class="greekheb">Καιρὸν γνῶθι</span>—“Know the right season for everything” (Diog. Laert. i. 4, § 6). It is significant, in connexion with the conclusion maintained in the Introduction, Ch. iii., that Demetrius Phalereus, the librarian of Ptolemy Philadelphus, wrote a treatise, <span class="greekheb">περὶ καιροῦ</span>, <span class="ital">of opportuneness</span> (Diog. Laert. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-5.htm" title="A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;">Ecclesiastes 3:5</a> § 9). So Theognis, (402), <span class="greekheb">Μηδὲν ἄγαν σπεύδειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καιρὸς δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πάσιν ἄριστος</span>, “Do nothing in excess, In all we do is the right season precious.” So here the thought with which the new section opens is that it is wisdom to do the right thing at the right time, that inopportuneness is the bane of life. The survey of human occupations and interests that follows has a striking parallel in the <span class="ital">Meditations</span> of Marcus Aurelius (iv. 32), who, from his Stoic standpoint, sees in their perpetual recurrence, evidence of the monotonous iteration of the phenomena of man’s life, analogous to that of the phenomena of Nature.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-22.</span> - Section 4. In confirmation of the truth that man's happiness depends upon the will of God, Koheleth proceeds to show how <span class="accented">Providence arranges even the minutest concerns</span>; <span class="accented">that man can alter nothing</span>, <span class="accented">must make the best of things as they are</span>, <span class="accented">bear with anomalies</span>, <span class="accented">bounding his desires by this present life</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - The providence of God disposes and arranges every detail of man's life. This proposition is stated first generally, and then worked out in particular by means of antithetical sentences. In Hebrew manuscripts and most printed texts vers. 2-8 are arranged in two parallel columns, so that one "time" always stands under another. A similar arrangement is found in <a href="/joshua/12-9.htm">Joshua 12:9</a>, etc., containing the catalogue of the conquered Canaanite kings; and in <a href="/esther/9-7.htm">Esther 9:7</a>, etc., giving the names of Haman's tensions. In the present passage we have fourteen pairs of contrasts, ranging from external circumstances to the inner affections of man's being. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To every thing there is u season, and a time to every purpose under heaven</span>. . "Season" and "time" are rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The word for "season" (<span class="accented">zeman</span>), denotes a fixed, definite portion of time; while <span class="accented">eth</span>, "<span class="accented">time</span>," signifies rather the beginning of a period, or is used as a general appellation. The two ideas are sometimes concurrent in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1</a> (comp. also <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and <a href="/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, where we find the singular <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in Theodotion, and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the Septuagint). So in Wisd. 8:8, "wisdom to foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="accented">Every thing</span> refers especially to men's movements and actions, and to what concerns them. <span class="accented">Purpose</span>; <span class="accented">chephets</span>, originally meaning "delight," "pleasure," in the later Hebrew came to signify "<span class="accented">business</span>," "thing," "<span class="accented">matter</span>." The proposition is - In human affairs Providence arranges the moment when everything shall happen, the duration of its operation, and the time appropriate thereto. The view of the writer takes in the whole circumstances of men's life from its commencement to its close. But the thought is not, as some have opined, that there is naught but uncertainty, fluctuation, and imperfection in human affairs, nor, as Plumptre conceives, "It is wisdom to do the right thing at the right time, that inopportuneness is the bane of life," for many of the circumstances mentioned, e.g. birth and death, are entirely beyond men's will and control, and the maxim, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>, cannot apply to man in such cases. Kobeleth is confirming his assertion, made in the last chapter, that wisdom, wealth, success, happiness, etc., are not in man's hands, that his own efforts can secure none of them - they are distributed at the will of God. He establishes this dictum by entering into details, and showing the ordering of Providence and the supremacy of God in all men's concerns, the most trivial as well as the most important. The Vulgate gives a paraphrase, and not a very exact one, <span class="accented">Omnia tempus habeat</span>, <span class="accented">et</span> suis <span class="accented">spatiis transenat universa sub caelo</span>. Koheleth intimates, without attempting to reconcile, the great <span class="accented">crux</span> of man's free-will and God's decree. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For there is a man who labours with wisdom, and knowledge, and ability; and to a man who has not laboured for it, must he leave it as his portion: also that is vain, and a great evil." Ewald renders: whose labour aims after wisdom. But &#1489;&#1468;&#1495; &#1493;&#1496;&#1493; do not denote obj.

Instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, there is used the more emphatic form of the noun: &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;, who had his labour, and performed it; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-5.htm">Jeremiah 9:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-6.htm">Jeremiah 9:6</a>, "Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit," and Hitz. under <a href="/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27</a>.
