To rend garments, in case of blasphemy, and in times of mourning and fasting, and then to sew them up when they are over; see <a href="/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1</a>; This the Jews apply to the rending of the ten tribes from Rehoboam, signified by the rending of Jeroboam's garment, <a href="/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>; the sewing up or uniting of which is foretold, <a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a>. Some interpret it of the rending of the Jewish church state, signified by the rending of the vail, at the death of Christ; and of the constituting the Gospel church state among the Gentiles; <p>a time to keep silence, and a time to speak (k); when it is an evil time, a time of calamity in a nation, it is not a time to be loquacious and talkative, especially in a vain and ludicrous way, <a href="/amos/5-13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>; or when a particular friend or relation is in distress, as in the case of Job and his friends, <a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>; or when in the presence of wicked men, who make a jest of everything serious and religious, <a href="/psalms/39-1.htm">Psalm 39:1</a>; and so when under afflictive dispensations of Providence, it is a time to be still and dumb, and not open the mouth in a murmuring and complaining way, <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>. And, on the other hand, there is a time to speak, either publicly, of the truths of the Gospel, in the ministry of it, and in vindication of them; or privately, of Christian experience: there is a time when an open profession should be made of Christ, his word and ordinances, and when believers should speak to God in prayer and praise; which, should they not, the stones in the wall would cry out. <p>(k)   ,    , Homer.

It is, however, somewhat against this view that it makes this generalisation practically identical with that of <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-4.htm" title="A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;">Ecclesiastes 3:4</a>. The symbolic use of “rending a garment” to represent the division of a kingdom, as in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="/1_kings/11-30.htm" title="And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:">1 Kings 11:30</a>) and therefore of “sewing” for the restoration of unity (so the “seamless garment” of <a href="/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a> has always been regarded as a type of the unity of Christ’s Church) seems to suggest a more satisfying sense. There are seasons when it is wise to risk or even to cause discord and division in families (<a href="/context/matthew/10-34.htm" title="Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword....">Matthew 10:34-35</a>) or schism in Church or State, other seasons when men should strive to restore unity and to be healers of the breach (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm" title="And they that shall be of you shall build the old waste places: you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.">Isaiah 58:12</a>). In the parable of the New Patch upon the old Garment we have an instance of an inopportune sewing which does but make the rent worse (<a href="/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.">Matthew 9:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a time to keep silence, and a time to speak</span>] Here again the range of thought has been needlessly limited by interpreters to the silence which belongs to deep sorrow, of which we have an example in the conduct of the friends of Job (<a href="/context/job/2-12.htm" title="And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven....">Job 2:12-13</a>), of the want of which in the sons of the prophets Elisha complained bitterly (<a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm" title="And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.">2 Kings 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-5.htm" title="And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.">2 Kings 2:5</a>). This is, of course, not excluded, but the range of the law is wider, and takes in on the one hand, the unseasonable talk of the “prating fool” of <a href="/proverbs/10-8.htm" title="The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.">Proverbs 10:8</a>, and on the other the “word spoken in due season” (<a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm" title="A man has joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!">Proverbs 15:23</a>), to one that is weary (<a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned.">Isaiah 50:4</a>), the right word at the right time, in the utterance of which we rightly see a genius akin to inspiration. If it is true at times that speech is silvern and silence golden, there are times when the converse also is true, when the word in season is like “apples of gold (= perhaps, oranges) in a basket of silver” (<a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm" title="A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.">Proverbs 25:11</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to rend, and a time to sew</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). This is usually understood of the rending of garments in token of grief (<a href="/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29, 34</a>, etc.), and the repairing of the rent then made when the season of mourning was ended. The Talmudists laid down careful rules concerning the extent of the ritual tear, and how long it was to remain unmended, both being regulated by the nearness of the relationship of the deceased person. In this interpretation there are these two difficulties: first, it makes the clause a virtual repetition of ver. 4; and secondly, it is not known for certain that the closing of the rent was a ceremonial custom in the times of Koheleth. Hence Plumptre inclines to take the expression metaphorically of the division of a kingdom by schism, and the restoration of unity, comparing the Prophet Ahijah's communication to Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30, 31</a>). But surely this would be a most unlikely allusion to put into Solomon's mouth; nor can we properly look for such a symbolical representation amid the other realistic examples given in the series. What Koheleth says is this - There are times when it is natural to tear clothes to pieces, whether from grief, or anger, or any other cause, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being old and worthless, or infected; and there are times when it is equally natural to mend them, and to make them serviceable by timely repairs. Connected with the notion of mourning contributed by this clause, though by no means confined to that notion, it is added, <span class="cmt_word">A time to keep silence, and a time to speak</span>. The silence of deep sorrow may be intimated, as when Job's friends sat by him in sympathizing silence (<a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>), and the psalmist cried, "I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred" (<a href="/psalms/39-2.htm">Psalm 39:2</a>); and Elisha could not bear to hear his master's departure mentioned (<a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5</a>). There are also occasions when the sorrow of the heart should find utterance, as in David's lament over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a>, etc.) and over Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-33.htm">2 Samuel 3:33</a>, etc.). But the gnome is of more general application. The young should hold their peace in the presence of their elders (<a href="/job/32-4.htm">Job 32:4</a>, etc.); silence is often golden: "Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent" (<a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>). On the other hand, wise counsel is of infinite value, and must not be withheld at the right moment, and "a word in due season, how good is it!" (<a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>). "If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbor; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth" (Ecclus. 5:12; see more, Ecclus. 20:5, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Everything has its time, and every purpose under the heavens its hour." The Germ. language is poor in synonyms of time. Zckler translates: Everything has its Frist ..., but by Frist we think only of a fixed term of duration, not of a period of beginning, which, though not exclusively, is yet here primarily meant; we have therefore adopted Luther's excellent translation. Certainly &#1494;&#1502;&#1503; (from &#1494;&#1502;&#1503;, cogn. &#1505;&#1502;&#1503;, signare), belonging to the more modern Heb., means a Frist (e.g., <a href="/daniel/2-16.htm">Daniel 2:16</a>) as well as a Zeitpunkt, point of time; in the Semit. (also Assyr. simmu, simanu, with &#1505;) it is the most common designation of the idea of time. &#1506;&#1514; is abbreviated either from &#1506;&#1504;&#1514; (&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, to determine) or from &#1506;&#1504;&#1514; (from &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, cogn. &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, to go towards, to meet). In the first case it stands connected with &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; on the one side, and with &#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; (from &#1506;&#1491;&#1491;, to count) on the other; in the latter case, with &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a> (perhaps also &#1506;&#1503; and &#1506;&#1504;&#1514; in &#1499;&#1506;&#1503;, &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1514;). It is difficult to decide this point; proportionally more, however, can be said for the original &#1506;&#1504;&#1514; (Palest.-Aram. &#1506;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;), as also the prep. of participation &#1488;&#1514; is derived from &#1488;&#1504;&#1514; (meeting, coming together). <p>(Note: Vid., Orelli's work on the Heb. Synon. der Zeit u. Ewigkeit, 1871. He decides for the derivation from &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; morf ; Fleischer (Levy's Chald. W.B.
