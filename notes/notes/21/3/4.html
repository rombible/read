The funeral and the wedding, the hired mourners and the guests at the marriage-feast, are set against one another. The first clause intimates the spontaneous manifestation of the feelings of the heart; the second, their formal expression in the performances at funerals and weddings and on other solemn occasions. The contrast is found in the Lord's allusion to the sulky children in the market-place, who would not join their companions' play: "We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented" (<a href="/matthew/11-17.htm">Matthew 11:17</a>).

The lxx, as well as the other Greek transl., and Jerome, had before them the words &#1489;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1513;&#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;. The former translates: "Man has not the good which he shall eat and drink," i.e., also this that he eats ... is for him no true good; but the direct contrary of this is what Koheleth says. Jerome seeks to bring the thought which the text presents into the right track, by using the form of a question: nonne melius est comedere ...; against this <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>, are not to be cited where &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; stands in the dependent sentence; the thought is not thus to be improved; its form is not this, for &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; rof ,siht, beginning a sentence, is never interrog., but affirm.; thus &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; is not  equals  &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, but is a negative statement. It is above all doubt, that instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; we must read &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>; for, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-17.htm">Job 33:17</a>, the initial letter mem after the terminal mem has dropped out.

Besides, only &#1502; is to be inserted, not &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1497;; for the phrase &#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1497; is used, but not &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; &#1505;. Instead of ba-a-da-m, the form la-a-da-m would be more agreeable, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>. Hitzig remarks, without proof, that ba&#772;a&#772;da&#772;m is in accordance with later grammatical forms, which admit &#1489;  equals  "for" before the object. &#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>, is neither prep. of the object, nor is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;, Sir. 3:7, the exponent of the dative (vid., Grimm). ba&#772;a&#772;da&#772;m signifies, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>, and as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;, Sir. 11:14, inter homines; also <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a> designates by &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; what among them (men) has to be regarded as good.<p>It is interesting to see how here the ancient and the modern forms of the language run together, without the former wholly passing over into the latter; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, quam ut edat, is followed by norm. perfects, in accordance with that comprehensive peculiarity of the old syntax which Ewald, by an excellent figure, calls the dissolution of that which is coloured into grey. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; ... &#1492;&#1491; is equivalent to &#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a>, the causative rendering of the phrase &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, or &#1512; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>. It is well to attend to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493; by his labour, which forms an essential component part of that which is approved of as good. Not a useless sluggard-life, but a life which connects together enjoyment and labour, is that which Koheleth thinks the best in the world. But this enjoyment, lightening, embellishing, seasoning labour, has also its But: etiam hoc vidi e manu Dei esse (pendere). The order of the words harmonizes with this Lat.; it follows the scheme referred to at <a href="/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a>; cf. on the contrary, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:6</a>. Instead of &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;, neut. by attraction, there is here the immediately neut. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492;; the book uniformly makes use of this fem. form instead of &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;.
