set that aside, and judges will not use their power well. And there is another Judge that stands before the door. With God there is a time for the redressing of grievances, though as yet we see it not. Solomon seems to express his wish that men might perceive, that by choosing this world as their portion, they brought themselves to a level with the beasts, without being free, as they are, from present vexations and a future account. Both return to the dust from whence they were taken. What little reason have we to be proud of our bodies, or bodily accomplishments! But as none can fully comprehend, so few consider properly, the difference between the rational soul of man, and the spirit or life of the beast. The spirit of man goes upward, to be judged, and is then fixed in an unchangeable state of happiness or misery. It is as certain that the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth; it perishes at death. Surely their case is lamentable, the height of whose hopes and wishes is, that they may die like beasts. Let our inquiry be, how an eternity of existence may be to us an eternity of enjoyment? To answer this, is the grand design of revelation. Jesus is revealed as the Son of God, and the Hope of sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That which befalleth the sons of men - literally, the event (happenstance) of the sons of men, i. e., what comes upon them from outside, by virtue of the ordinance of God. See the <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14</a> note. Death in particular <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a> is a part of the "work that God doeth."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Literally, "For the sons of men (Adam) are a mere chance, as also the beast is a mere chance." These words can only be the sentiments of the skeptical oppressors. God's delay in judgment gives scope for the "manifestation" of their infidelity (Ec 8:11; Ps 55:19; 2Pe 3:3,4). They are "brute beasts," morally (Ec 3:18; Jude 10); and they end by maintaining that man, physically, has no pre-eminence over the beast, both alike being "fortuities." Probably this was the language of Solomon himself in his apostasy. He answers it in Ec 3:21. If Ec 3:19, 20 be his words, they express only that as regards liability to death, excluding the future judgment, as the skeptic oppressors do, man is on a level with the beast. Life is "vanity," if regarded independently of religion. But Ec 3:21 points out the vast difference between them in respect to the future destiny; also (Ec 3:17) beasts have no "judgment" to come.<p>breath&#8212;vitality.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All go unto one place; </span> to the earth, as it is expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm" title="Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a></span>, out of which they were both taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All turn to dust again; </span> which is meant only of their bodies, as it is explained, <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All go unto one place,....

So Lucretius, as a disciple of Epicurus, speaks (<span class="ital">De Rer. Nat</span>. v. 259) of earth as being<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Omniparens eadem rerum commune sepulcrum.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The mother and the sepulchre of all.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all are of the dust</span>] There is an obviously deliberate reference to the narrative of the Creation in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>. To those who did not see below the surface, it seemed to affirm, as it did to the Sadducee, the denial of a life to come. “Dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return” was the sentence passed, they might say, as on the brute creation, so on man also (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All go unto one place</span>. All, men and brutes, are buried in the earth (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). The author is not thinking of Sheol, the abode of departed spirits, but merely regarding earth as the universal tomb of all creatures. Plumptre quotes Lueretius, 'De Rer. <span class="accented">Nat</span>.,' 5:260 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Omniparens eadem rerum commune sepulchrum."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The mother and the sepulcher of all."</span> Thus Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The course of nature seems a course of death;<br />The prize of life's brief race, to cease to run;<br />The sole substantial thing, death's nothingness."</span> <span class="cmt_word">All are of the dust</span> (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>). So Ecclus. 41:10, "All things that are of earth shall turn to earth again." This is true of the material part of men and brutes alike; the question of the destiny of the immaterial part is touched in the next verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Thus I discerned it then, that all that God will do exists for ever; nothing is to be added to it, and nothing taken from it: God has thus directed it, that men should fear before Him." This is a conclusion derived from the facts of experience, a truth that is valid for the present and for the time to come. We may with equal correctness render by quidquid facit and quidquid faciet. But the pred. shows that the fut. expression is also thought of as fut.; for &#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506; does not mean: that is for ever (Hitz.), which would be expressed by the subst. clause &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;; but: that shall be for ever (Zck.), i.e., will always assert its validity. That which is affirmed here is true of God's directing and guiding events in the natural world, as well as of the announcements of His will and His controlling and directing providence in the history of human affairs. All this is removed beyond the power of the creature to alter it. The meaning is not that one ought not to add to or to take from it (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>), but that such a thing cannot be done (vid., Sir. 18:5). And this unchangeableness characterizing the arrangements of God has this as its aim, that men should fear Him who is the All-conditioning and is Himself unconditioned: he has done it that they (men) should fear before Him, &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;, fecit ut; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>. &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, <a href="/revelation/13-15.htm">Revelation 13:15</a>; and "fear before Him," as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>.; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/16-30.htm">1 Chronicles 16:30</a> with <a href="/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>. The unchangeableness of God's action shows itself in this, that in the course of history similar phenomena repeat themselves; for the fundamental principles, the causal connections, the norms of God's government, remain always the same. </body></html>
