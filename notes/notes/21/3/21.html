The sceptical thought is, “We see that death resolves into dust (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm" title="In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust shall you return.">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>; see also <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/41-10.htm" title="All that are of the earth shall turn to earth again: so the ungodly shall go from a curse to destruction.">Ecclesiasticus 41:10</a>) the bodies of men and animals alike; and if it be alleged that there is a difference as to what becomes of their spirits, can this be asserted with the certainty of knowledge?” The writer here seems to have read both <a href="/psalms/49-14.htm" title="Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.">Psalm 49:14</a> and <a href="/proverbs/15-24.htm" title="The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.">Proverbs 15:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:16-22 Without the fear of the Lord, man is but vanity; set that aside, and judges will not use their power well. And there is another Judge that stands before the door. With God there is a time for the redressing of grievances, though as yet we see it not. Solomon seems to express his wish that men might perceive, that by choosing this world as their portion, they brought themselves to a level with the beasts, without being free, as they are, from present vexations and a future account. Both return to the dust from whence they were taken. What little reason have we to be proud of our bodies, or bodily accomplishments! But as none can fully comprehend, so few consider properly, the difference between the rational soul of man, and the spirit or life of the beast. The spirit of man goes upward, to be judged, and is then fixed in an unchangeable state of happiness or misery. It is as certain that the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth; it perishes at death. Surely their case is lamentable, the height of whose hopes and wishes is, that they may die like beasts. Let our inquiry be, how an eternity of existence may be to us an eternity of enjoyment? To answer this, is the grand design of revelation. Jesus is revealed as the Son of God, and the Hope of sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The King James Version of this verse is the only rendering which the Hebrew text, as now pointed, allows. It is in accordance with the best Jewish and many modern interpreters. A slightly different pointing would be requisite to authorize the translation, "Who knows the spirit of the sons of man whether it goes above, and, the spirit of the beast whether it goes down below?" etc., which, though it seems neither necessary nor suitable, is sanctioned by the Septuagint and other versions and by some modern interpreters.<p>Who knoweth - This expression (used also in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>) does not necessarily imply complete and absolute ignorance. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11</a>, it is applied to what is partially understood: compare similar forms of expression in <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/94-16.htm">Psalm 94:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>. Moreover, it is evident from marginal references that Solomon did not doubt the future existence and destination of the soul. This verse can only be construed as a confession of much ignorance on the subject.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Who knoweth&#8212;Not doubt of the destination of man's spirit (Ec 12:7); but "how few, by reason of the outward mortality to which man is as liable as the beast and which is the ground of the skeptic's argument, comprehend the wide difference between man and the beast" (Isa 53:1). The Hebrew expresses the difference strongly, "The spirit of man that ascends, it belongeth to on high; but the spirit of the beast that descends, it belongeth to below, even to the earth." Their destinations and proper element differ utterly [Weiss].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It might be objected, that the conditions of men and beasts are vastly differing, because man’s spirit goeth upward to God, <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a></span>, but the spirit of a beast goeth downward, together with its body, and perisheth with it. To this he answers, <span class="ital">Who knoweth this</span>? which is not to be understood as if no man did know it, or as if the thing were utterly uncertain and unknown, for he knew it, and positively affirms it, <span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a></span>; but that few know it; as the same manner of expression is understood, <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm" title="Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.">Proverbs 31:10</a></span>, <span class="ital">Who can find</span>? <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm" title="Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?">Isaiah 53:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">Who hath believed</span>? &c.; which note the scarcity or difficulty, but not the nullity or impossibility of the thing. Besides, he seems here to speak not so much of a speculative as of a practical knowledge, as such words are most commonly used. Who considers or regards this, or layeth it to heart? True it is, there is such a difference, which also is known and believed by wise and good men; but the generality of mankind never mind it; their hearts are wholly set upon this life, and upon present and sensible things, and they place all their hopes and happiness in them, and take no thought nor care for the things of the future and invisible world. And as to them with whom Solomon hath to do in this matter, the argument is strong and good, being, as logicians call it, an argument to the man; and there is no considerable difference between sensual men and beasts, because their affections are set upon the same objects, and both of them are partakers of the same sensual satisfactions, and subject to the same sensual pains and miseries, and their hopes and felicity perish together, to wit, at death, and therefore such men are no more happy than the beasts that perish. Others understand it thus, <span class="ital">Who knoweth this</span>? to wit, by sense or experience, or merely by his own reason, or without the help of Divine revelation. But, with the leave of so many worthy interpreters, and with submission to better judgments, the former seems to be the truer sense. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward?.... There is indeed a difference between a man and a beast; though they have one breath, they have not one spirit or soul; man has a rational and immortal soul, which, when he dies, goes upwards to God that gave it; to be judged by him, and disposed of by him, in its proper apartment, until the day of the resurrection of the body; <p>and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? when the beast dies, its spirit goes down to the earth, from whence it came, and is resolved into it, and is no more. But who is it that sees, or can see and know with the eyes of his body, the difference of these two spirits, or the ascent of the one, and the descent of the other?, Or who knows by the dint of reason, by the strength of his own understanding, without a divine revelation, that man has an immortal soul which goes upwards at death, when that of a beast goes downwards? No man, clearly and fully, as appears from the doubts and half faith of the wisest Heathens concerning it: or rather who knows and considers this difference between the spirit of a man and the spirit of a beast, and thinks within himself what a precious and immortal soul he has, and is concerned for the salvation of it? Very few; and hence it is they live and die like beasts, as they do. The Midrash interprets this of the souls of the righteous that go up to heaven, and of the souls of the wicked that go down to hell. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</span><p>(k) Meaning, that reason cannot comprehend that which faith believes in.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward</span>] The words imply a strictly sceptical rather than a negative answer. They do not actually deny, still less do they affirm, as some have thought, that the spirit of man does ascend to a higher life, while that of the brute returns to dust. This would indeed be inconsistent with the whole context, and the <span class="ital">consensus</span> of the LXX., the Vulgate, the Targum, and the Syriac versions, all of which give “Who knoweth whether the spirit of man goeth upward?” is practically decisive. It is not till nearly the close of the book, with all its many wanderings of thought, that the seeker rests in that measure of the hope of immortality which we find in ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>. Here we have the accents, almost the very formula, of Pyrrhonism (Diog. Laert. ix. 11, §. 73), as borrowed from Euripides:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τίς δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">οἶδεν εἰ τὸ ζῇν μὲν ἐστι κατθανεῖν</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ κατθανεῖν δὲ ζῇν νομίζεται βροτοῖς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“Who knoweth if true life be found in death,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>While mortals think of what is death as life?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Once more Lucretius echoes the phase of thought through which the <span class="bld">Debater</span> was passing:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Ignoratur enim quae sit natura animai,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nata sit an contra nascentibus insinuetur,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Et simul intereat nobiscum morte dirempta,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An tenebras Orci visat vastasque lacunas.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“We know not what the nature of the soul,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or born, or entering into men at birth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or whether with our frame it perisheth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or treads the gloom and regions vast of death.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">De Rer.

There is at least the conception of a spirit that ascends to a life higher than its own, as a possible solution of the great enigma presented by the disorders of the world.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</span> The statement is here too categorically rendered, though, for dogmatical purposes, the Masorites seem to have punctuated the text with a view to such interpretation. But, as Wright and others point out, the analogy of two other passages (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:19</a> and Ecclesiastes 6:12), where "who knoweth" occurs, intimates that the phrases which follow are interrogative. So the translation should be, "Who knoweth as regards the spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) of the sons of men whether it goeth upward, and as regards the spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) of the beast whether it goeth downward under the earth?" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quis novit si spiritus</span>, etc.? Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>; "Who ever saw the spirit of the <span class="accented">sons</span> of man, whether it goeth upward?" The Authorized Version, which gives the Masoretic reading, is supposed to harmonize better with the assertion at the end of the book (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>), that the spirit returns to the God who gave it. But there is no formal denial of the immortality of the soul in the present passage as we render it. The question, indeed, is not touched. The author is confirming his previous assertion that, in one point of view, man is not superior to brute. Now he says, looking at the matter merely externally, and taking not into consideration any higher notion, no one knows the destiny of the living powers, whether God deals differently with the spirit of man and of beast. Phenomenally, the principle of life in both is identical, and its cessation is identical; and what becomes of the spirit in either case neither eye nor mind can discover. The distinction which reason or religion assumes, viz. that man's spirit goes upward and the brute's downward, is incapable of proof, is quite beyond experience. What is meant by "upward" and "downward" may be seen by reference to the gnome in <a href="/proverbs/15-24.htm">Proverbs 15:24</a>, "To the wise the way of life goeth upward, that he may depart from Sheol beneath." The contrast shows that Sheol is regarded as a place of punishment or annihilation; this is further confirmed by <a href="/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14, 15</a>, "They are appointed as a flock for Sheol: death shall be their shepherd...  their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; for he shall receive me." Koheleth neither denies nor affirms in this passage the immortality of the soul; that he believed in it we learn from other expressions; but he is not concerned with parading it here. Commentators quote Lucretius' sceptical thought ('De Rer. Nat.,' 1:113-116) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ignoratur enim quae sit natura animal,<br />Nata sit, an contra nascentibus insinuetur,<br />Et simul interest nobiscum, morte dimenta,<br />An tenebras Orci visat vastasque lacunas."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"We know not what the nature of the soul,<br />Born in the womb, or at the birth infused,<br />Whether it dies with us, or wings its way<br />Unto the gloomy pools of Orcus vast."</span> But Koheleth's inquiry suggests the possibility of a different destiny for the spirits of man and brute, though he does not at this moment make any definite assertion on the subject. Later on he explains the view taken by the believer in Divine revelation (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"That which is now hath been long ago; and that which will be hath already been: God seeketh after that which was crowded out." The words: "hath been long ago" (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), are used of that which the present represents as something that hath been, as the fruit of a development; the words: "hath already been" (&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;), are used of the future (&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, vid., Gesen. 132. 1), as denying to it the right of being regarded as something new. The government of God is not to be changed, and does not change; His creative as well as His moral ordering of the world produces with the same laws the same phenomena (the &#1493; corresponds to this line of thought here, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:14</a>) - God seeks &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1503; (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>; Ewald, 277d). Hengstenberg renders: God seeks the persecuted (lxx, Symm., Targ., Syr.), i.e., visits them with consolation and comfort. Nirdaph here denotes that which is followed, hunted, pressed, by which we may think of that which is already driven into the past; that God seeks, seeks it purposely, and brings it back again into the present; for His government remains always, and brings thus always up again that which hath been. Thus Jerome: Deut instaurat quod abiit; the Venet.: &#x3bf;&#788;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; and thus Geier, among the post-Reform. interpreters: praestat ut quae propulsa sunt ac praeterierunt iterum innoventur ac redeant; and this is now the prevailing exposition, after Knobel, Ewald, and Hitzig. The thought is the same as if we were to translate: God seeks after the analogue. In the Arab., one word in relation to another is called muradif, if it is cogn. to it; and mutaradifat is the technical expression for a synonym. In Heb. the expression used is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, they who are followed the one by another, - one of which, as it were, treads on the heels of another. But this designation is mediated through the Arab. In evidence of the contrary, ancient examples are wanting. </body></html>
