If so, it seems to me clear that the writer, who has up to this recorded the words of Kohéleth, now speaks in his own name, and informs his readers that the preacher, whose teaching of the people he preserves, was also a writer, and the author of the well-known Proverbs.<p><span class= "bld">Moreover.</span>—This, the first word of the epilogue, is one of the specialties of the book of Ecclesiastes.

These are the words of one that could speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world, which can do nothing to ease men of the burden of sin. As he considered the worth of souls, he gave good heed to what he spake and wrote; words of truth will always be acceptable words. The truths of God are as goads to such as are dull and draw back, and nails to such as are wandering and draw aside; means to establish the heart, that we may never sit loose to our duty, nor be taken from it. The Shepherd of Israel is the Giver of inspired wisdom. Teachers and guides all receive their communications from him. The title is applied in Scripture to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The prophets sought diligently, what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. To write many books was not suited to the shortness of human life, and would be weariness to the writer, and to the reader; and then was much more so to both than it is now. All things would be vanity and vexation, except they led to this conclusion, That to fear God, and keep his commandments, is the whole of man. The fear of God includes in it all the affections of the soul towards him, which are produced by the Holy Spirit. There may be terror where there is no love, nay, where there is hatred. But this is different from the gracious fear of God, as the feelings of an affectionate child. The fear of God, is often put for the whole of true religion in the heart, and includes its practical results in the life. Let us attend to the one thing needful, and now come to him as a merciful Saviour, who will soon come as an almighty Judge, when he will bring to light the things of darkness, and manifest the counsels of all hearts. Why does God record in his word, that ALL IS VANITY, but to keep us from deceiving ourselves to our ruin? He makes our duty to be our interest. May it be graven in all our hearts. Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all that concerns man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage is properly regarded as the Epilogue of the whole book; a kind of apology for the obscurity of many of its sayings.

The unknown writer of the attestation (probably the President of the Sanhedrin, or some other Master of the Wise, such as were Hillel and Gamaliel) begins by repeating the key-note of the opening of the book. So taken, the words are every way significant. They do not name Solomon as the author, but content themselves with recognising the enigmatic name with which the unknown writer had veiled himself. He, they say, belonged to the company of the sages. He “gave good heed” (literally, <span class="bld">he hearkened</span> or <span class="bld">gave ear</span>), he “sought out” (we note how exactly the word describes the tentative, investigating character of the book, as in <a href="/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Jdg 18:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-3.htm" title="And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Think you that David does honor your father, that he has sent comforters to you? has not David rather sent his servants to you, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?">2 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-11.htm" title="The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that has understanding searches him out.">Proverbs 28:11</a>; <a href="/job/5-27.htm" title="See this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know you it for your good.">Job 5:27</a>; <a href="/job/28-27.htm" title="Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yes, and searched it out.">Job 28:27</a>), he “set in order” (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="bld">composed</span>) “many proverbs.” The word for “proverbs” is that which stands as the title of the Book of Proverbs, but it expresses, more than the English term does, the parabolic, half-enigmatic character which is characteristic of most sayings of this nature in the East, and as such is translated by “parables” in the LXX. here, and in the A.V. in <a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm" title="Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?">Ezekiel 20:49</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-4.htm" title="I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying on the harp.">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-7.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.">Numbers 23:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-18.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, you son of Zippor:">Numbers 23:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-24.htm" title="Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.">Numbers 23:24</a> and elsewhere. The words have been pressed by some interpreters as a testimony to the Salomonic authorship, but it is obvious that though they fit in with that hypothesis, they are equally applicable to any one who followed in the same track and adopted the same method of teaching.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - THE EPILOGUE.

What the writer here asserts is that Koheleth did not merely possess wisdom, but had made good use of it for the instruction of others. The author throws aside his disguise, and speaks of his object in composing the book, with a glance at the historical Solomon whom he had personated. That he uses the third person in relation to himself is nothing uncommon in historical memoirs, etc. Thus Daniel writes; and St. John, Thucydides, Xenophon, Caesar, mask their personality by dropping their identity with the author (comp. also <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>). The attestation that follows is compared with that at the end of St. John's Gospel (<a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>), and is plainly intended to confirm the authority of the writer, and to enforce on the hearer the conviction that, though Solomon himself did not compose the work, it has every claim to receive attention, and possesses intrinsic value. <span class="cmt_word">He still taught the people knowledge.</span> As well as being esteemed one of the company of sages, he further (<span class="accented">od</span>) took pains to instruct his contemporaries (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint), to apply his wisdom to educational purposes. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he gave good heed</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">weighed</span> (like our word "ponder"); only thus used in this passage. It denotes the careful examination of every fact and argument before it was presented to the public. <span class="cmt_word">Sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span> There is no copula in the original; the weighing and the investigation issued in the composition of "proverbs," which term includes not only the wit and wisdom of past ages in the form of pithy sayings and apophthegms, but also parables, truths in metaphorical guise, riddles, instructions, allegories, etc., all those forms which are found in the canonical Book of Proverbs. The same word (<span class="accented">mishle</span>) <span class="accented">is used</span> here as in the title of <span class="accented">that</span> book. Koheleth, however, is not necessarily referring to that work (or to <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>, etc.), or implying that he himself wrote it; he is only putting forth his claim to attention by showing his patient assiduity in the pursuit of wisdom, and how that he adopted a particular method of teaching.

The notion of the <span class="accented">mashal</span> being similitude, comparison, the writer's pondering and searching were needed to discover hidden analogies, and, by means of the known and familiar, to lead up to the more obscure and abstruse.

Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; with art.: eo (illo) tempore, vid., under Sol 8:8. What follows is regarded by Winzer, with Mich., Spohr, and partly Nachtigal, as a further description of the night to which old age, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>, is compared: Watchers then guard the house; labourers are wearied with the labours and cares of the day; the maids who have to grind at the mill have gone to rest; and almost all have already fallen asleep; the women who look out from the windows are unrecognisable, because it has become dark. But what kind of cowardly watchers are those who "tremble," and what kind of (per antiphrasin) strong men who "bow themselves" at evening like children when they have belly-ache! Ginsburg regards <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2-5</a> as a continuation of the description of the consequences of the storm under which human life comes to an end: the last consequence is this, that they who experience it lose the taste for almonds and the appetite for locusts. But what is the meaning of this quaint figure? it would certainly be a meaningless and aimless digression. Taylor hears in this verse the mourning for the dead from <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>, where death is described: the watchers of the house tremble; the strong men bow themselves, viz., from sorrow, because of the blank death has made in the house, etc.; but even supposing that this picture had a connection in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>, how strange would it be! - the lookers out at the windows must be the "ladies," who are fond of amusing themselves at windows, and who now - are darkened. Is there anything more comical than such little ladies having become darkened (whether externally or internally remains undetermined)? However one may judge of the figurative language of <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a> begins the allegorical description of hoary old age after its individual bodily symptoms; interpreters also, such as Knobel, Hitz., and Ewald, do not shrink from seeking out the significance of the individual figures after the old Haggadic manner. The Talm. says of shomre&#772; habbayith: these are the loins and ribs; of the anshe&#772; hehhayil: these are the bones; of harooth baaru&#780;bboth: these, the eyes. The Midrash understand the watchers of the house, of the knees of the aged man; the men of strength, of his ribs or arms; the women at the mill, of the digestive organs (&#1492;&#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, <p>(Note: This hamses is properly the second stomach of the ruminants, the cellular caul.)<p>the stomach, from omasum); those who have become few, of the teeth; the women looking out at the window, of the eyes; another interpretation, which by harooth thinks of the lungs, is not worth notice.<p>Here also the Targ. principally follows the Midrash: it translates the watchers of the house by "thy knees;" strong men by "thine arms;" the women at the mill by "the teeth of thy mouth;" the women who look out at the window by "thine eyes." These interpretations for the most part are correct, only those referable to the internal organs are in bad taste; references to these must be excluded from the interpretation, for weakness of the stomach, emphysema of the lungs, etc., are not appropriate as poetical figures. The most common biblical figures of the relation of the spirit or the soul to the body is, as we have shown, Psychol. p. 227, that of the body as of the house of the inner man. This house, as that of an old man, is on all sides in a ruinous condition. The shomre&#772; habbayith are the arms terminating in the hands, which bring to the house whatever is suitable for it, and keep away from it whatever threatens to do it injury; these protectors of the house have lost their vigour and elasticity (<a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>), they tremble, are palsied (&#1497;&#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, Pilp. &#1494;&#1506;&#1494;&#1506;, bibl. and Mishn.: to move violently hither and thither, to tremble, to shake), <p>(Note: Vid., Friedr. Delitzsch's Indogerm.-Sem. Stud. p. 65f.)<p>so that they are able neither to grasp securely, to hold fast and use, nor actively to keep back and forcibly avert evil. Anshe&#772; he&#780;hhayil designates the legs, for the shoqe&#772; haish are the seat of his strength, <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>; the legs of a man in the fulness of youthful strength are like marble pillars, Sol 5:15; but those of the old man hith'authu (Hithpa. only here) have bowed themselves, they have lost their tight form, they are shrunken (&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-4.htm">Job 4:4</a>, etc.) and loose; 4 Macc. 4:5 calls this &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;.

The emperor asked the Rabbi Joshua b. Chananja why he did not visit &#1489;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1503; (a place where learned conversation, particularly on religious subjects, was carried on). He answered: "The mount is snow ( equals  the hair of the head is white), ice surrounds me ( equals  whiskers and beard on the chin white), its (of my body) dogs bark not (the voice fails), and its grinders (the teeth) grind not." The proper meaning of &#1489;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1503;, Levy has not been able clearly to bring to light in his Neuhebr. u. Chald.

Taylor interprets mi'etu transitively: the women grinding rest when they have wrought a little, i.e., they interrupt their labour, because on account of the occurrence of death, guests are now no longer entertained; but the beautiful appropriate allegory maintains its place against this supposed lamentation for the dead; also &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; does not signify to accomplish a little (Targ.), but to take away, to become few (lxx, Syr., Jerome, Venet. Luther), as such as Pih. as <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a>, &#1511;&#1492;&#1492;, to become blunt. And by &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; we are not to think, with Taylor, of women such as Sidera's mother or Michal, who look out of the window, but of the eyes, more exactly the apples of the eyes, to which the orbita (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;; Symm. &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;) and the eyelids with the eye-lashes are related as a window is to those who look out; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (from &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;, R. &#1512;&#1489;, to entwine firmly and closely) is the window, consisting of a lattice of wood; the eyes are, as Cicero (Tusc. i. 20) calls them, quasi fenestrae animi; the soul-eyes, so to speak, without which it could not experience what sight is, look by means of the external eyes; and these soul-bodily eyes have become darkened in the old man, the power of seeing is weakened, and the experiences of sight are indistinct, the light of the eyes is extinguished (although not without exception, <a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>). </body></html>
