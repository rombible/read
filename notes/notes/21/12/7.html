When a man has the pain of reviewing a misspent life, his not having given up sin and worldly vanities till he is forced to say, I have no pleasure in them, renders his sincerity very questionable. Then follows a figurative description of old age and its infirmities, which has some difficulties; but the meaning is plain, to show how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. As the four verses, 2-5, are a figurative description of the infirmities that usually accompany old age, ver. 6 notices the circumstances which take place in the hour of death. If sin had not entered into the world, these infirmities would not have been known.

The body, which is made of dust, and is no other in its present state than dust refined and enlivened; and when the above things take place, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>, or at death, it returns to its original earth; it becomes immediately a clod of earth, a lifeless lump of clay, and is then buried in the earth, where it rots, corrupts, and turns into it; which shows the frailty of man, and may serve to humble his pride, as well as proves that death is not an annihilation even of the body; see <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <p>and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it; from whom it is, by whom it is created, who puts it into the bodies of men, as a deposit urn they are entrusted with, and are accountable for, and should be concerned for the safety and salvation of it; this was originally breathed into man at his first creation, and is now formed within him by the Lord; hence he is called the God of the spirits of all flesh; see <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>. Now at death the soul, or spirit of man, returns to God; which if understood of the souls of men in general, it means that at death they return to God the Judge of all, who passes sentence on them, and orders those that are good to the mansions of bliss and happiness, and those that are evil to hell and destruction. So the Targum adds, <p>"that it may stand in judgment before the Lord;'' <p>or if only of the souls of good men, the sense is, that they then return to God, not only as their Creator, but as their covenant God and Father, to enjoy his presence evermore; and to Christ their Redeemer, to be for ever with him, than which nothing is better and more desirable; this shows that the soul is immortal, and dies not with the body, nor sleeps in the grave with it, but is immediately with God. Agreeably to all this Aristotle (w) says, the mind, or soul, alone enters  from without, (from heaven, from God there,) and only is divine; and to the same purpose are the words of Phocylides (x), <p>"the body we have of the earth, and we all being resolved into it become dust, but the air or heaven receives the spirit.'' <p>And still more agreeably to the sentiment of the wise man here, another Heathen (y) writer observes, that the ancients were of opinion that souls are given of God, and are again returned unto him after death. <p>(w) De Generat.

They see in that return to God, nothing more than the absorption of the human spirit into the <span class="ital">Anima Mundi</span>, the great World-Soul, which the Pantheist identified with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is believed, however, that the thoughts in which the <span class="bld">Debater</span> at last found anchorage were other than these. The contrast between the sceptical “Who knoweth the spirit of man that it goeth upward?” (ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm" title="Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>) and this return to God, “who gave it,” shews that the latter meant more than the former. The faith of the Israelite, embodied in the <span class="ital">Shemà</span> or Creed which the writer must have learnt in childhood, was not extinguished. The “fear of God” is with him a real feeling of awe before One who lives and wills (ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm" title="There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither has he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm" title="Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>). The hand of God is a might that orders all things (ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm" title="For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them.">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>). It is God that judges the righteous and the wicked (ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm" title="I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>). Rightly, from this point of view, has the Targum paraphrased the words “The Spirit will return to stand in judgment before God, who gave it thee.” The long wandering to and fro in many paths of thoughts ends not in the denial, but the affirmation, of a personal God and therefore a personal immortality.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the dust return</span>, etc. - the sentence begun above being still carried on to the end of the verse. Here we are told what becomes of the complex man at death, and are thus led to the explanation of the allegorical language used throughout. Without metaphor now it is stated that the material body, when life is extinct, returns to that matter out of which it was originally made (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; comp. <a href="/job/34-15.htm">Job 34:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). So Siracides calls man "dust and ashes," and asserts that all things that are of the earth turn to the earth again (Ecclus. 10:9 Ecclus. 40:11). Soph., 'Electra,' 1158 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x1fef;&#x39d;&#x39b;&#x1ffd;&#x39c;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Instead of thy dear form,<br />Mere dust and idle shadow."</span> Corn. a Lapide quotes a remarkable parallel given by Plutarch ('Apol. ad Apollon.,' 110) from Epicharmus," Life is compounded and broken up, and again goes whence it came; earth indeed to earth, and the spirit to upper regions." <span class="cmt_word">And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it</span>; or, for the <span class="accented">spirit - the</span> clause being no longer subjunctive, but speaking indicatively of fact. In the first clause the preposition "to" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, in the second <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, as if to mark the distinction between the downward and the upward way. The writer now rises superior to the doubts expressed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a> (where see note), "Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward," etc.? It is not that he contradicts himself in the two passages, as some suppose, and have hence regarded ver. 7 as an interpolation; but that after all discussion, after expressing the course of his perplexities, and the various phases of his thought, he comes to the conclusion that there is a future for the individual soul, and that it shall be brought into immediate connection with a personal God. There is here no thought of its being absorbed in the <span class="accented">anima mundi</span>, in accordance with the heathen view, which, if it believed dimly in an immortality, denied the personality of the soul (see Eurip., ' Suppl.,' 529-534; Lucret., 2. 998, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 3:455, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.). Nor have we any opinion given concerning the adverse doctrines of creationism and traducianism, though the terms used are most consistent with the former. God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life; when this departs, he who gave receives it; God "gathereth in" man's breath (<a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). The clause, taken in this restricted sense, would say nothing about the soul, the personal "I;" it would merely indicate the destination of the vital breath; and many critics are content to see nothing more in the words. But surely this would be a feeble conclusion of the author's wanderings; rather the sentence signifies that death, releasing the spirit, or soul, from the earthly tabernacle, places it in the more immediate presence of God, there, as the Targum paraphrases the passage, returning to stand in judgment before its Creator. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a> (where, inappropriately, a new chapter begins, instead of beginning with <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>) the call takes a new course, resting its argument on the transitoriness of youth: "And remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, ere the days of evil come, and the years draw nigh, of which thou shalt say: I have no pleasure in them." The plur. majest. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498;  equals  &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; as a designation of the Creator, <a href="/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-2.htm">Psalm 149:2</a>; in so recent a book it cannot surprise us, since it is also not altogether foreign to the post-bibl. language. The expression is warranted, and the Midrash ingeniously interprets the combination of its letters.<p>(Note: It finds these things expressed in it, partly directly and partly indirectly: remember &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, thy fountain (origin); &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1498;, thy grave; and &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498;, thy Creator.

These evil days, adverse years, are now described symptomatically, and that in an allegorical manner, for the "ere" of <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a> is brought to a grand unfolding. </body></html>
