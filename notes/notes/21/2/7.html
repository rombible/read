What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I got - Rather, I bought, in distinction from those born in the house.

They were much more esteemed by their masters, and showed a much closer attachment to the family than the bought slaves or the conquered aboriginals, who were often reduced to this state (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20, 21</a>). The number of Solomon's attendants excited the wonder of the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, etc.; 1 Kings 10:5), and with good reason, if Josephus's account is to be believed. This writer asserts that the king had some thousand or more chariots, and twenty thousand horses. The drivers and riders were young men of comely aspect, tall and well-made; they had long flowing hair, and wore tunics of Tyrian purple, and powdered their hair with gold dust, which glittered in the rays of the sun ('Ant.,' 8:07. 3). Attended by a cavalcade thus arrayed, Solomon used to betake himself to his "paradise" at Etham, to enjoy the refreshing coolness of its trees and pools. <span class="cmt_word">Great and small cattle</span>; <span class="accented">oxen and sheep</span>. The enormous amount of Solomon's herds and flocks is proved by the extraordinary multitude of the sacrifices at the consecration of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and the lavish provision made daily for the wants of his table (<a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>). The cattle of David were very numerous, and required special overlookers (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-29.htm">1 Chronicles 27:29-31</a>). Job (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>) had, before his troubles, seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and these items were all doubled at the return of his prosperity. Among Solomon's possessions, horses are not here mentioned, though they formed no inconsiderable portion of his live stock, and added greatly to his magnificence. Koheleth, perhaps, avoided boasting of this extravagance in consideration of the religious sentiment which was strongly opposed to such a feature. <span class="cmt_word">That were in Jerusalem before me</span> (so ver. 9; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>). But the reference here may not necessarily be to kings, but to chieftains and rich men, who were celebrated for the extent of their possessions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I have said in mine heart: Up then, I will prove thee with mirth, and enjoy thou the good! And, lo, this also is vain." Speaking in the heart is not here merely, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16-17</a>, speaking to the heart, but the words are formed into a direct address of the heart. The Targ. and Midrash obliterate this by interpreting as if the word were &#1488;&#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, "I will try it" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a>). Jerome also, in rendering by vadam et affluam deliciis et fruar bonis, proceeds contrary to the usual reading of '&#1488;&#1503; Niph. of &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;, vid., at <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>), as if this could mean, "I will pour over myself." It is an address of the heart, and &#1489; is, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, that of the means: I will try thee with mirth, to see whether thy hunger after satisfaction can be appeased with mirth. &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; also is an address; Grtz sees here, contrary to the Gramm., an infin. continuing the &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;; u&#772;re&#772;h, <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>, is the connect. form of the particip. adj. ra&#772;e&#780;h; and if ree&#772;h could be the inf. after the forms naqqe&#772;h, hinna&#772;qqe&#772;h, it would be the inf. absol., instead of which &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; was to be expected. It is the imper.: See good, sinking thyself therein, i.e., enjoy a cheerful life. Elsewhere the author connects &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; less significantly with the accus. - obj., <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>.<p>This was his intention; but this experiment also to find out the summum bonum proves itself a failure: he found a life of pleasure to be a hollow life; that also, viz., devotedness to mirth, was to him manifestly vanity. </body></html>
