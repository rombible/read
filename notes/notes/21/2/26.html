The world is a vale of tears, even to those that have much of it. See what fools they are, who make themselves drudges to the world, which affords a man nothing better than subsistence for the body. And the utmost he can attain in this respect is to allow himself a sober, cheerful use thereof, according to his rank and condition. But we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use those things to make us diligent and cheerful in worldly business. And this is the gift of God. Riches are a blessing or a curse to a man, according as he has, or has not, a heart to make a good use of them. To those that are accepted of the Lord, he gives joy and satisfaction in the knowledge and love of him. But to the sinner he allots labour, sorrow, vanity, and vexation, in seeking a worldly portion, which yet afterwards comes into better hands. Let the sinner seriously consider his latter end. To seek a lasting portion in the love of Christ and the blessings it bestows, is the only way to true and satisfying enjoyment even of this present world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The doctrine of retribution, or, the revealed fact that God is the moral Governor of the world, is here stated for the first time (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a> ff) in this book.<p>This also is vanity - Not only the travail of the sinner.

No man is of himself good, or naturally so, but evil, very evil, as all the descendants of Adam are; there are some that are good in their own eyes, and in the sight of others, and yet not truly good; they are only really good, who are so in the sight of God, who sees the heart, and knows what is in man; they are such who are made good by his efficacious grace; who are inwardly, and not merely outwardly so; who are good at heart, or who have good hearts, clean hearts, new and right spirits created in them; who have a good work of grace upon their hearts, and the several graces of the Spirit implanted there; who have the good Spirit of God in them, in whose heart Christ dwells by faith; and who have the good word of Christ dwelling in them, and have a good treasure of rich experience of the grace of God; and who, in one word, are born again, renewed in the spirit of their minds, and live by faith on Jesus Christ. The phrase is rendered, "whoso pleaseth God", <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>; and he is one that is accepted with God in Christ, his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased; who is clothed with his righteousness, made comely through his comeliness, and so is irreprovable in his sight; and who by faith looks to and lays hold on this righteousness, and does all he does in the exercise of faith, without which it is impossible to please God. To such a man God gives <p>wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; wisdom to acquire knowledge, to keep, use, and improve it; and joy, to be cheerful and thankful for the good things of life: or rather this may design, not natural wisdom, but spiritual wisdom, wisdom in the hidden part, so as to be wise unto salvation, and to walk wisely and circumspectly, a good man's steps being ordered by the Lord; and knowledge of God in Christ, and of Christ, and of the things of the Gospel, and which relate to eternal life; and so spiritual joy, joy and peace in believing, in the presence of God, and communion with him; joy in Christ, and in hope of the glory of God, even joy unspeakable, and full of glory; all which, more or less, at one time or another, God gives to those who are truly good; and which is not to be found in worldly wisdom, pleasure, riches, power, and authority: the Targum is, <p>"to the man, whose works are right before God, he gives wisdom and knowledge in this world, and joy with the righteous in the world to come;'' <p>but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up; to gather mammon, and to heap up a large possession, as the Targum; to gather together a great deal of riches, but without wisdom and knowledge to use them, without any proper enjoyment of them, or pleasure in them; all he has is a deal of trouble and care to get riches, without any comfort in them, and he has them not for his own use: the Midrash illustrates this of the good man and sinner, by the instances of Abraham and Nimrod, of Isaac and Abimelech, of Jacob and Laban, of the Israelites and Canaanites, of Hezekiah and Sennacherib, and of Mordecai and Haman. But <p>that he may give to him that is good before God; so it is ordered by divine Providence sometimes, that all that a wicked man has been labouring for all his days should come into the hands of such who are truly good men, and will make a right use of what is communicated to them. <p>This also is vanity, and vexation of spirit; not to the good man, but to the wicked man: so the Targum, <p>"it is vanity to the sinner, a breaking of spirit;'' <p>it grieves him that such a man should have what he has been labouring for; or it would, if he knew it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God.

What we get here is the recognition of what we have learnt to call the moral government of God in the distribution of happiness. It is found to depend not on outward but inward condition, and the chief inward condition is the character that God approves. The <span class="bld">Debater</span> practically confesses that the life of the pleasure-seeker, or the ambitious, or the philosopher seeking wisdom as an end, was not good before God, and therefore failed to bring contentment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wisdom, and knowledge, and joy</span>] The combination forms an emphatic contrast with ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm" title="For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>, and marks a step onward in the seeker’s progress. There is a wisdom which is not grief, an increase of knowledge which is not an increase of sorrow. We are reminded of the parallel thought which belongs to a higher region of the spiritual life, “The Kingdom of God … is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>). Here the lesson is that the man who seeks great things fails to find them, that he who is content with a little with God’s blessing on it, finds in that little much. He becomes <span class="greekheb">αὐτάρκης</span> (= self-sufficing)—and has enough.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but to the sinner he giveth travail</span>] The words point to a further perception of a moral order in the midst of the seeming disorders of the world. The fruitless labour of the sinner in heaping up his often ill-gotten gains is not altogether wasted. His treasure passes into hands that make a better use of it than he has done. So we find a like thought in <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm" title="He that by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.">Proverbs 28:8</a>, “He that by usury and unjust gains increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor,” and in <a href="/context/job/27-16.htm" title="Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;...">Job 27:16-17</a>, “Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver” (comp. <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm" title="A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This also is vanity</span>] The question which we have to answer is whether this sentence is passed only on the travail of the sinner, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm" title="Then I looked on all the works that my hands had worked, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>, or whether it includes also the measure of joy attainable by him who is “good” in the sight of God. From one point of view the former interpretation gives a preferable meaning, as more in harmony with what immediately precedes. On the other hand, it is characteristic of the cynical pessimism into which the Preacher has, by his own confession, fallen, that he should fall back into his despondency even after a momentary glimpse of a truth that might have raised him from it. The “Two Voices” utter themselves, as in Tennyson’s poem, (see Appendix II.) in a melancholy alternation and there comes a time when the simple joys which God gives to the contented labourer, no less than the satiety of the voluptuous and the rich, seem to him but as “vanity and <span class="bld">feeding upon wind.</span>”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight</span>. The subject "God" is not, in the Hebrew, an omission which is supposed to justify its virtual insertion in ver. 25. The Vulgate boldly supplies it here, <span class="accented">Homini bone in conspectu sue dedit Deus</span>. To the man that finds favor in God's sight (<a href="/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who pleases him, ha gives blessings, while he withholds them or takes them away from the man who displeases him.

(more worthy) hands. Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:14. 25 -  "Absumet heres Caecuba dignior Servata centum clavibus." The moral government of God is here recognized, as below, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15, 17</a>, etc., and a further thought is added on the subject of retribution: <span class="cmt_word">That he may give to him that is good before God</span>. This idea is found in <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>, "He that augmenteth his substance by usury and increase, gathereth it for him that hath pity upon the poor;" and Ecclesiastes 13:22, "The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous" (comp. <a href="/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16, 17</a>). So in the parable of the talents, the talent of the unprofitable servant is given unto him who had made best use of his money (<a href="/matthew/25-28.htm">Matthew 25:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This also is vanity</span>. It is a question what is the reference here. Delitzsch considers it to be the striving after pleasure in and from labor (ver. 24); Knobel, the arbitrary distribution of the good things of this life; but, put thus baldly, this could hardly be termed a "feeding on wind;" nor could that expression be applied to the "gifts of God" to which Bullock confines the reference. Wright, Hengstenberg, Gratz, and others deem that what is meant is the collecting and heaping up of riches by the sinner, which has already been decided to be vanity (vers. 11, 17, 18); and this Would limit the general conclusion to a particular instance. Taking the view contained in ver. 24 as the central idea of the passage, we see that Koheleth feels that the restriction upon man's enjoyment of labor imposed by God's moral government makes that toil vain because its issue is not in men's hands, and it is a striving for or a feeding on wind because the result is unsatisfying and vanishes in the grasp. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then I turned to give up my heart on account of  equals  to despair of all the labour with which I wearied myself under the sun." As at <a href="/1_samuel/22-17.htm">1 Samuel 22:17</a>., Sol 2:17; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-14.htm">Jeremiah 41:14</a>, &#1505;&#1489;&#1489; has here the intrans. meaning, to turn about (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;  equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;). Hitzig remarks that &#1508;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1493;&#1489; signify, "to turn round in order to see," and &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, on the contrary, "to turn round in order to do." But &#1508;&#1504;&#1492; can also mean, "to turn round in order to do," e.g., <a href="/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9</a>; and &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, "to turn in order to examine more narrowly," <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>. The distinction lies in this, that &#1508;&#1504;&#1492; signifies a clear turning round; &#1505;&#1489;&#1489;, a turning away from one thing to another, a turning in the direction of something new that presents itself (<a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:7</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>).

The Talm., however, uses along with nithya&#772;e&#772;sh (vid., p. 638) not only noa&#780;sh, but also &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, in the sense of despair, or the giving up of all hope (subst. &#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;), Meza 21b, from which it is at once evident that &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, is not to be thought of as causative (like the Arab. ajjasa and aiasa), but as simply transitive, with which, after the passage before us, &#1500;&#1489;&#1493; is to be thought of as connected. He turned round to give up all heart. He had no more any heart to labour. </body></html>
