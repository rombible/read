(Pr 17:24). The worldly "wise" man has good sense in managing his affairs, skill and taste in building and planting, and keeps within safe and respectable bounds in pleasure, while the "fool" is wanting in these respects ("darkness," equivalent to fatal error, blind infatuation), yet one event, death, happens to both (Job 21:26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then I saw; </span> or, <span class="ital">yet I saw</span>; for this is added to prevent an Objection or mistake. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Wisdom excelleth folly; </span> although wisdom is not sufficient to make men truly and perfectly happy, yet it is of a far greater use and excellency than vain pleasures, or any other follies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As far as light excelleth darkness, </span> i.e. vastly and unspeakably. Light is very pleasant and comfortable, and withal of great necessity and singular use to discover the differences of persons and things, to prevent mistakes and dangers, and to direct all a man’s paths in the right way; whereas darkness is in itself doleful, and leads men into innumerable confusions, and errors, and miseries. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then I sat that wisdom excelleth folly,....

A man is conscious of being more truly man when he looks before and after, and knows how to observe. Light is, after all, better than darkness, even if it only shews us that we are treading the path that leads to nothingness.

This result, at any rate, was obtained - he learned that wisdom had a certain value, that it was as much superior to folly, in its effects on men, as light is more beneficial than darkness. It is a natural metaphor to represent spiritual and intellectual development as light, and mental and moral depravity as darkness (comp. <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I procured servants and maidens, and also I obtained servants born in the house; also the possession of flocks; I obtained many horned and small cattle before all who were in Jerusalem before me." The obtaining of these possessions is, according to <a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>., to be understood of purchase. There is a distinction between the slaves, male and female (mancipia), obtained by purchase, and those who were home-born (vernae), the &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;) &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, who were regarded as the chief support of the house (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>), on account of their attachment to it, and to this day are called (Arab.) fada wayyt, as those who offer themselves a sacrifice for it, if need be. Regarding &#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, in the sense of increasing possession; and regarding &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, vid., at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>; at all events, the sing. of the pred. may be explained from this, that the persons and things named are thought of in the mass, as at <a href="/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5</a>; <a href="/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a> (although the idea there may be also individualizing); but in the use of the pass., as at <a href="/genesis/35-26.htm">Genesis 35:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>, the Semite custom is different, inasmuch as for it the passive has the force of an active without a definite subject, and thus with the most general subject; and as to the case lying before us in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:7</a>, we see from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-49.htm">Exodus 12:49</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>, that &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) in such instances is thought of as neut. According to <a href="/genesis/26-14.htm">Genesis 26:14</a> and the passage before us, &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; lay nearer than &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, but the primary form instead of the connecting form is here the traditional reading; we have thus apposition (Nebenordnung) instead of subordination (Annexion), as in zevahim shelamim, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and in habbaqar hannehhosheth, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm">2 Kings 16:17</a>, although vaqar vatson may also be interpreted as the accus. of the more accurate definition: the possession of flocks consisting in cattle and sheep. But this manner of construction is, for a book of so late an origin, too artificial. What it represents Solomon as saying is consistent with historical fact; at the consecration of the temple he sacrificed hecatombs, <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>; and the daily supply for the royal kitchen, which will at the same time serve to show the extent of the royal household, was, according to <a href="/1_kings/5-2.htm">1 Kings 5:2</a>., enormous.<p>There now follows the enumeration of riches and jewels which were a delight to the eye; and finally, the large provision made for revelling in the pleasures of music and of sensual love. </body></html>
