It would seem to follow that the writer is here only giving the history of Solomon’s reflections, and not his ultimate conclusions. Better to omit the note of interrogation after “wise man,” and put a note of exclamation after “fool,” the “how” being used as in <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm" title="That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!">Isaiah 14:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm" title="And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, How are you destroyed, that were inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which were strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!">Ezekiel 26:17</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12-17 Solomon found that knowledge and prudence were preferable to ignorance and folly, though human wisdom and knowledge will not make a man happy.

The Targum interprets it, in the world to come; but even in this world the remembrance of a wise man, any more than of a fool, does not always last; a wise man may not only be caressed in life, but may be remembered after death for a while; the fame of him may continue for a little time, and his works and writings may be applauded; but by and by rises up another genius brighter than he, or at least is so thought, and outshines him; and then his fame is obscured, his writings are neglected and despised, and he and his works buried in oblivion; and this is the common course of things. This shows that Solomon is speaking of natural wisdom, and of man's being wise with respect to that; and his remembrance on that account; otherwise such who are truly good and wise, their memory is blessed; they are had in everlasting remembrance, and shall never be forgotten in this world, nor in that to come, when the memory of the wicked shall rot; whose names are only written in the dust <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>, and not in the Lamb's book of life; <p>seeing that which now is, in the days to come shall all be forgotten: what now is in the esteem of men, and highly applauded by them; what is in the mouths of men, and in their minds and memories, before long, future time, after the death of a man, as the Targum, or in some time after, will be thought of no more, and be as if it never had been, or as if there never had been such men in the world. Many wise men have been in the world, whose names are now unknown, and some their names only are known, and their works are lost; and others whose works remain, yet in no esteem: this is to be understood in general, and for the most part; otherwise there may be some few exceptions to this general observation. <p>And how dieth the wise man? as the fool; they are both liable to death; it is appointed for men, rinse or unwise, learned or unlearned, to die, and both do die; wisdom cannot secure a man from dying; and then wise and fools are reduced to the same condition and circumstances; all a man's learning, knowledge, and wisdom, cease when he dies, and he is just as another man is; in that day all his learned thoughts perish, and he is upon a level with the fool. Solomon, the wisest of men, died as others; a full proof of his own observation, and which his father made before him, <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>. But this is not true of one that is spiritually wise, or wise unto salvation; the death of a righteous man is different from the death of a wicked man; both die, yet not alike, not in like manner; the good man dies in Christ, he dies in faith, has hope in his death, and rises again to eternal life. The Targum is, <p>"and how shall the children of men say, that the end of the righteous is as the end of the wicked?'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <i>there is</i> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> for ever; seeing that which now <i>is</i> in the days to come shall all be forgotten.

There are sages, we say, who live yet in the memory of men whose names the world will not willingly let die. Practically, however, as regards the influence of the desire for posthumous fame as a motive, the number of such names is inappreciably small, even with the manifold resources of monuments and written records. The scribes and doctors, the artists and the poets of one age are forgotten in the next, and only here or there can any man be bold to say with Bacon that he commits his memory “to the care of future ages.” (See note on ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm" title="There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a>.) Even a biographical dictionary is often but as the sepulchre of the mouldering remains of reputations that have been long since dead, and their place knoweth them no more. Then, as in later days, there were those who substituted the permanence of fame for that of personal being, and the <span class="bld">Debater</span>, with his incisive question shatters the unsubstantial fabric.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And how dieth the wise man? As the fool</span>] Literally, “<span class="bld">with the fool</span>,” as if in partnership with him, sharing the same lot. Better, perhaps, as an exclamation, not a question, “<span class="bld">How dieth the wise man with</span> (= as) <span class="bld">the fool.</span> The absence of any hope of an immortality beyond that of fame has been already implied. The present clause brings before us the manner and circumstances of death. We stand, as it were, by the two death-beds, of the wise and of the fool, and note the same signs of the end, the same glazed eye, the same death-dew on the brow, the same failing power of thought. The picture of chap. <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm" title="Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw near, when you shall say, I have no pleasure in them;...">Ecclesiastes 12:1-6</a> is true of both. The seeker had apparently never stood by the death-bed of one whose face was lit up, and, as it were, transfigured by a “hope full of immortality.” Here also we may trace in the later personator of Solomon a deliberate protest against what seemed to him the teaching of Ecclesiastes (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-1.htm" title="For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave....">Wis 2:1-9</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever</span>; Revised Version, more emphatically, for <span class="accented">of the wise man</span>, <span class="accented">even as of the fool</span>, <span class="accented">there is no remembrance forever</span>. This, of course, is not absolutely true. There are men whose names are history, and will endure  as long as the world lasts; but speaking generally, oblivion is the portion of all; posterity soon forgets the wisdom of one and the folly of another. Where the belief in the future life was not a strong and animating motive, posthumous fame exercised a potent attraction for many minds. To be the founder of a long line of descendants, -r to leave a record which should be fresh in the minds of future generations, these were objects of intense ambition, and valued as worthy of highest aspirations and best efforts. The words of classical poets will occur to our memory; e.g. Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:30. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Exegi monumentum aere perennius...<br />Non omnis metier, multaque pars mei<br />Vitabit Libitinam."</span> Ovid, '<span class="accented">Amor</span>.,' 1:15. 4 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ergo etiam, cum me supremus adederit ignis,<br />Vivam, parsquc mei multa supersteserit."</span> But Koheleth shows the vanity of all such hopes; they are based on sounds which experience proves to be unsubstantial. Though Solomon's own fame gives the lie to the statement received without limitation (comp. Wisd. 8:13), yet his reflections might well have taken this turn, and the writer is quite justified in putting the thought into his mouth, as the king could not know how subsequent ages would regard his wisdom and attainments. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten</span>. The clause has been variously translated. Septuagint, "Forasmuch as the coming days, even all the things, are forgotten;" Vulgate, "And future times shall cover all things equally with oblivion." Modern editors give, "Since in the days that are to come they are all forgotten;" "As in time past, so in days to come, all will be forgotten.... In the days which are coming [it will be said by-and-by], The whole of them are long ago forgotten.'" This is a specimen of the uncertainty of exact interpretation, where the intended meaning is well ascertained. "<span class="accented">All"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span>) may refer either to wise and foolish, or to the circumstances of their lives. <span class="cmt_word">And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</span> Better taken as one sentence, with an exclamation, <span class="accented">How doth the wise man die with</span> (<span class="accented">even</span> as) <span class="accented">the fool I</span> (For "with" (<span class="accented">ira</span>), equivalent to "as," comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>; <a href="/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>.) "How" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;</span>) is sarcastic, as <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, or sorrowful, as <a href="/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>. The same complaint falls from a psalmist's lips, "He seeth that wise men die; the fool and the brutish together <span class="accented">perish"</span> (<a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>). So David laments the death of the murdered leader, "Should Abner die as a fool dieth?" (<a href="/2_samuel/3-33.htm">2 Samuel 3:33</a>). Plumptre considers that the author of the Book of Wisdom expands this view with the design of exposing its fallacy, and introducing a better hope (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1-9</a>). But that writer would not have designated Solomon's sentiments as those of "<span class="accented">the</span> ungodly" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>), nor foisted these utterances of sensualists and materialists upon so honored a source. At the same time, it is only as being victims, <span class="accented">nil miserantis Opel</span>, the prey of the pitiless and indiscriminating grave, that the wise and foolish are placed in the same category. There is the widest difference between the death-beds of the two, as the experience of any one who has watched them will testify, the one happy with the consciousness of duty done honestly, however imperfectly, and bright with the hope of immortality; the other darkened by vain regrets and shrinking despair, or listless in brutish insensibility. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus become great and also continuing wise, he was not only in a condition to procure for himself every enjoyment, but he also indulged himself in everything; all that his eyes desired, i.e., all that they saw, and after which they made him lust (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>) (cf. <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>), that he did not refuse to them (&#1488;&#1510;&#1500;, subtrahere), and he kept not back his heart from any kind of joy (&#1502;&#1504;&#1506;, with min of the thing refused, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-11.htm">Numbers 24:11</a>, etc., oftener with min, of him to whom it is refused, e.g., <a href="/genesis/30-2.htm">Genesis 30:2</a>), for (here, after the foregoing negations, coinciding with immo) his heart had joy of all his work; and this, viz., this enjoyment in full measure, was his part of all his work. The palindromic form is like <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>. We say in Heb. as well as in German: to have joy in (an, &#1489;), anything, joy over (ber, &#1506;&#1500;) anything, or joy of (von, &#1502;&#1503;) anything; Koheleth here purposely uses min, for he wishes to express not that the work itself was to him an object and reason of joy, but that it became to him a well of joy (cf. <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-27.htm">2 Chronicles 20:27</a>). Falsely, Hahn and others: after my work (min, as e.g., <a href="/psalms/73-20.htm">Psalm 73:20</a>), for thereby the causative connection is obliterated: min is the expression of the mediate cause, as the concluding sentence says: Joy was that which he had of all his work - this itself brought care and toil to him; joy, made possible to him thereby, was the share which came to him from it.</body></html>
