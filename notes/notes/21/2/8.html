Their guesses are so numerous that it would be wearisome to recount them. That adopted in our version is by no means one of the most probable. The interpretation “concubines” is most in favour with commentators, though they differ among themselves as to the grounds on which they justify this translation. And it does appear unlikely that this notorious feature of Solomon’s court should be omitted in an enumeration of his luxury. It will be seen from the margin that the words “of all sorts” have nothing corresponding to them in the original, but are intended as an equivalent for a Hebrew idiom, in which a plural is intensified by prefixing a noun in the singular.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm" title="I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>. </span><span class="ital">I gathered me silver and gold </span>— Vast riches; <span class="ital">and the peculiar treasure of kings </span>— Riches, answerable to the state of a king, or, he means, the greatest jewels and rarities of other kings, which they gave to me, either as a tribute, or by way of present; <span class="ital">and of the provinces </span>— Which were imposed upon or presented by all the provinces of my dominions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 Solomon soon found mirth and pleasure to be vanity. What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed.

Moreover, among the treasures of kings were precious garments of various sorts, as were in the treasury of Ahasuerus (l); and when Alexander took Shushan, he found in the king's treasures, of Hermionic purple, to the value of five thousand talents, which had been laid up there almost two hundred years (m); and to such treasure Christ alludes, <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>; <p>I got me men singers and women singers; the harmony and music of whose voices greatly delight; see <a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>; the Targum interprets it both of instruments of music for the Levites to use in the temple, and of singing men and women at a feast: and such persons were employed among other nations (n), on such occasions, to entertain their guests; and are called the ornaments of feasts (o); as were also "choraules", or pipers (p); <p>and the delights of the sons of men; as musical instruments, and that of all sorts; such as David his father invented; and to which he might add more, and indeed got all that were to be obtained; see <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>. The two last words, rendered "musical instruments, of all sorts", are differently interpreted; the Targum interprets them of hot waters and baths, having pipes to let out hot water and cold; Aben Ezra, of women taken captive; Jarchi, of chariots and covered wagons; the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, of cup bearers, men, and women, that pour out wine and serve it; and the Vulgate Latin version, of cups and pots, to pour out wine. It seems best to understand it of musical instruments, or of musical compositions (q); sung either with a single voice, or in concert; which, according to Bochart (r), were called "sidoth", from Sido, a Phoenician woman of great note, the inventor of them or rather from giving unequal sounds, which, by their grateful mixture and temperament, broke and destroyed (s) one another. <p>(l) Targum Sheni in Esther vi. 10.

Many commentators, however, see in the phrase a description of the treasures of Solomon as being such as were the special possessions of sovereign rulers and sovereign states as distinct from the wealth of private citizens. The word for “province” may be noted as a comparatively late word, hardly coming into use till the time of the Captivity (<a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm" title="How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!">Lamentations 1:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/19-8.htm" title="Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.">Ezekiel 19:8</a>), and prominent chiefly in the books of the Persian period, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther and Daniel. It probably designates here the twelve districts into which Solomon divided his empire (<a href="/context/1_kings/4-7.htm" title="And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision....">1 Kings 4:7-19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">men singers and women singers</span>] The mention of women shews that the singers meant are not those connected with the choir of the Temple, but those who, as in the speech of Barzillai (<a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm" title="I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?">2 Samuel 19:35</a>), figured at state banquets. These women, as in <a href="/isaiah/23-6.htm" title="Pass you over to Tarshish; howl, you inhabitants of the isle.">Isaiah 23:6</a>, were commonly taken from the class of harlot aliens, and as such were condemned by the counsel of the wise of heart (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/9-4.htm" title="Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts.">Sir 9:4</a>).

It was not likely, we may add, that so characteristic a feature in that monarch’s prodigal excesses should have been altogether passed over in a picture so elaborate. “Musical instruments,” it may be added, would have formed a somewhat poor climax to the long catalogue of kingly luxuries. The interpolated “<span class="ital">as</span>” should be omitted.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gathered me also silver and gold</span>. Much is said of the wealth of the historical Solomon, who had all his vessels of gold, armed his body-guard with golden shields, sat on an ivory throne overlaid with gold, received tribute and presents of gold from all quarters, sent his navies to distant lands to import precious metals, and made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones (see <a href="/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces</span>. The word rendered "the provinces" (<span class="accented">hammedinoth</span>), in spite of the article, seems to mean, not the twelve districts into which Solomon divided his kingdom for fiscal and economical purposes (<a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>, etc.), but countries generally exterior to Palestine, with which he had commercial or political relations, and which sent to him the productions for which they were each most celebrated. So the districts of the Persian empire were required to furnish the monarch with a certain portion of their chief commodities. His friendship with Hiram of Tyro brought him into connection with the Phoeni-clans, the greatest commercial nation of antiquity, and through them he accumulated riches and stores from distant and various lands beyond the limits of the Mediterranean Sea. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">medinah</span>) occurs again in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a> and in <a href="/1_kings/20-14.htm">1 Kings 20:14</a>, etc.; but is found elsewhere only in exilian or post-exilian books (e.g. <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>; <a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>, etc.). The "kings" may be the tributary monarchs, such as those of Arabia (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>); or the expression in the text may imply simply such treasure as only kings, and not private persons, could possess. <span class="cmt_word">Men-singers and women-singers.</span> These, of course, are not the choir of the temple, of which women formed no part, bur. musicians introduced at banquets and social festivals, to enhance the pleasures of the scene. They are mentioned in David's days (<a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>) and later (see <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; Ecclus. 35:5 Ecclus. 49:1). The females who took part in these performances were generally of an abandoned class; hence the, warning of Ben-Sira, "Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts" (Ecclus. 9:4). Such exhibitions were usually accompanied with dancing, the character of which in Eastern countries is well known. The Jews, as time went on, learned to tolerate many customs and practices, imported often from other lands, which tended to lower morality and self-respect. <span class="cmt_word">And the delights of the sons of men;</span> the sensual pleasures that men enjoy. The expression is euphemistic (comp. <a href="/songs/7-6.htm">Song of Solomon 7:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Musical instruments, and that of all sorts</span> (<span class="accented">shiddah veshiddoth</span>). The word (given here first in the singular number and then in the plural emphatically to express multitude) occurs nowhere else, and has, therefore, been subjected to various interpretations. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "a male cupbearer and female cupbearers;" and so the Syrian and. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Scyphos et urceos in ministerio ad vina fundenda</span> - which introduces rather a bathos into the description. After the clause immediately preceding, one might expect mention of Solomon's numerous harem (<a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>; <a href="/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>), and most modern commentators consider the word to mean "concubine," the whole expression denoting multiplicity, "wife and wives." The Authorized Version is not very probable, though somewhat supported by Kimchi, Luther, etc., and the Greek Venetian, which has, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, a musical term signifying "combination of tones," or harmony. Other interpretations are "captives," "litters," "coaches," "baths," "treasures," "chests," "demons." Ewald, followed by Motais and others, suggests that the word implies a strong or high degree of a quality, so that, connecting the two clauses together, we should render, "And in a word, all the delights of the sons of men in abundance." This seems a more appropriate termination to the catalogue than any specification of further sources of pleasure; but there is no very strong etymological reason to recommend it; and we can hardly suppose that, in the enumeration of Solomon's prodigalities, his multitudinous seraglio would be omitted. Rather it comes in here naturally as the climax and completion of his pursuit of earthly delight. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"To laughter I:said: It is mad; and to mirth: What doth it issue in?" Laughter and mirth are personified; mehola&#772;l is thus not neut. (Hitz., a foolish matter), but mas.

In the midst of the laughter and revelling in sensual delight, the feeling came over him that this was not the way to true happiness, and he was compelled to say to laughter, It has become mad (part. Poal, as at <a href="/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>), it is like one who is raving mad, who finds his pleasure in self-destruction; and to joy (mirth), which disregards the earnestness of life and all due bounds, he is constrained to say, What does it result in?  equals  that it produces nothing, i.e., that it brings forth no real fruit; that it produces only the opposite of true satisfaction; that instead of filling, it only enlarges the inner void. Others, e.g., Luther, "What doest thou?" i.e., How foolish is thy undertaking! Even if we thus explain, the point in any case lies in the inability of mirth to make man truly and lastingly happy, - in the inappropriateness of the means for the end aimed at. Therefore &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is thus meant just as in &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1508;&#1512;&#1497; (Hitz.), and &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, effect, <a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>.
