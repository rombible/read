What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed.

It indicates what we call a park, with flowing streams and shady groves and fruit trees, and deer feeding on the fresh green grass, and doves flitting through the trees, such as seemed to the Eastern imagination the fittest type of the highest blessedness. The whole scenery of the Song of Solomon is such a garden, planted with pomegranates and pleasant fruits, spikenards and camphire, calamus and cinnamon, and trees of frankincense, and lilies (Song <a href="/context/songs/4-13.htm" title="Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,...">Song of Solomon 4:13-15</a>; <a href="/songs/6-2.htm" title="My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.">Song of Solomon 6:2</a>). The pools of Solomon at Etam, on the south-west of Bethlehem, described by Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> viii. 7. 3) still preserve the memory of such a “paradise.” Other traces of these surroundings of the palaces of Jewish kings are found in the history of Naboth’s vineyard, where the “garden of herbs” can hardly be thought of as merely a “kitchen garden” (<a href="/1_kings/21-2.htm" title="And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.">1 Kings 21:2</a>) and in the garden of Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm" title="Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 52:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all kind of fruits</span>] The horticulture of Palestine included the apple, the fig, the pomegranate, the date, the caper-tree, nuts, almonds, raisins and mandrakes.

(For the trees in such parks, see <a href="/songs/4-13.htm">Song of Solomon 4:13, 14</a>; and for an estimate of Solomon's works, Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:07. 3.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>By the consecutive modus &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (aor. with ah, like <a href="/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-11.htm">Genesis 41:11</a>, and particularly in more modern writings; vid., p. 198, regarding the rare occurrence of the aorist form in the Book of Koheleth) he bears evidence to himself as to the end which, thus equipped with wisdom and knowledge, he gave his heart to attain unto (cf. 13a), i.e., toward which he directed the concentration of his intellectual strength.
