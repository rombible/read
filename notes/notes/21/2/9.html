What does noisy, flashy mirth towards making a man happy? The manifold devices of men's hearts, to get satisfaction from the world, and their changing from one thing to another, are like the restlessness of a man in a fever. Perceiving it was folly to give himself to wine, he next tried the costly amusements of princes. The poor, when they read such a description, are ready to feel discontent. But the remedy against all such feelings is in the estimate of it all by the owner himself. All was vanity and vexation of spirit: and the same things would yield the same result to us, as to Solomon. Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content. His wisdom remained with him; a strong understanding, with great human knowledge. But every earthly pleasure, when unconnected with better blessings, leaves the mind as eager and unsatisfied as before. Happiness arises not from the situation in which we are placed. It is only through Jesus Christ that final blessedness can be attained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Kings - Both tributary <a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> and independent <a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-14.htm">1 Kings 9:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>; the "provinces" probably correspond to the kingdoms mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>.<p>As musical ... sorts - Rather, Many women (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-3</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. great&#8212;opulent (Ge 24:35; Job 1:3; see 1Ki 10:23).<p>remained&#8212;(Ec 2:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I was great, </span> in riches, and power, and glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Also my wisdom remained with me; </span> as yet I was not wholly besotted and seduced from God by these things, as I was afterwards; I still had the use of my reason, whereby I was capable of searching after and finding satisfaction, if it was to be had in those things. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So I was great,....

They were for him experiments which he watched as with an intellectual impartiality. Like Goethe, he analysed his voluptuousness, and studied his own faculties of enjoyment.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So I was great</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 1:16). This refers to the magnificence and extent of his possessions and luxury, as the former passage to the surpassing excellence of his wisdom. We may compare the mention of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/26-13.htm">Genesis 26:13</a>), "The man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great" (<span class="accented">sc</span>. <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Also my wisdom remained with me</span>; <span class="accented">perseveravit mecum</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (Septuagint). In accordance with the purpose mentioned in ver. 3, he retained command of himself, studying philosophically the effects and nature of the pleasures of which he partook, and keeping ever in view the object of his pursuit. Voluptuousness was not the end which he sought, but one of the means to obtain the end; and what he calls his wisdom is not pure Divine wisdom that comes from above, but an earthly prudence and self-restraint. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I searched in my heart, (henceforth) to nourish my body with wine, while my heart had the direction by means of wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the children of men that they should do, all the number of the days of their life." After he became conscious that unbridled sensual intoxication does not lead to the wished-for end, he looked around him farther, and examined into the following reception for happiness. Inappropriately, Zckl., with Hengst.: "I essayed in my heart to nourish ...." &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean probare, but explorare, to spy out, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>, and frequently in the Book of Koheleth (here and at <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>) of mental searching and discovery (Targ. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;). With &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1498; there then follows the new thing that is contrived. If we read &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; and &#1504;&#1492;&#1490; in connection, then the idea of drawing a carriage, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>, and of driving a carriage, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>, lies near; according to which Hitzig explains: "Wine is compared to a draught beast such as a horse, and he places wisdom as the driver on the box, that his horse may not throw him into a ditch or a morass." But moshe&#772;k is not the wine, but the person himself who makes the trial; and nohe&#772;g is not the wisdom, but the heart, - the former thus only the means of guidance; no man expresses himself thus: I draw the carriage by means of a horse, and I guide it by means of a driv. Rightly the Syr.: "To delight (&#1500;&#1502;&#1489;&#1505;&#1502;&#1503;, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1501;, oblectare) my flesh with wine." Thus also the Targ. and the Venet., by "drawing the flesh." The metaphor does not accord with the Germ. ziehen  equals  to nourish by caring for (for which &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; is used); it is more natural, with Gesen., to compare the passing of trahere into tractare, e.g., in the expression se benignius tractare (Horace, <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>); but apart from the fact that trahere is a word of doubtful etymology,<p>(Note: Vid., Crossen's Nachtr. zur lat. Formenlehre, pp. 107-109.)<p>tractare perhaps attains the meaning of attending to, using, managing, through the intermediate idea of moving hither and thither, which is foreign to the Heb. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, which means only to draw, - to draw to oneself, and hold fast (attractum sive prehensum tenere). As the Talm. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; occurs in the sense of "to refresh," e.g., Chagiga 14a: "The Haggadists (in contradistinction to the Halachists) refresh the heart of a man as with water"; so here, "to draw the flesh"  equals  to bring it into willing obedience by means of pleasant attractions.<p>(Note: Grtz translates: to embrocate my body with wine, and remarks that in this lies a raffinement. But why does he not rather say, "to bathe in wine"? If &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; can mean "to embrocate," it may also mean "to bathe," and for &#1489;&#1497;&#1497;&#1503; may be read &#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;: in Grecian, i.e., Falernian, Chian, wine.)<p>The phrase which follows: velibbi nohe&#772;g bahhochma&#772;h, is conditioning: While my heart had the direction by means of wisdom; or, perhaps in accordance with the more modern usus loq. While my heart guided, demeaned, behaved itself with wisdom. Then the inf. limshok, depending on tarti as its obj., is carried forward with vele&#780;e&#780;hhoz besichluth. Plainly the subject treated of is an intermediate thing (Bardach: &#1502;&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;). He wished to have enjoyment, but in measure, without losing himself in enjoyment, and thereby destroying himself. He wished to give himself over to sweet desipere, but yet with wise self-possession (because it is sadly true that ubi mel ibi fel) to lick the honey and avoid the gall. There are drinkers who know how to guide themselves so that they do not end in drunken madness; and there are habitual pleasure-seekers who yet know how so far to control themselves, that they do not at length become rous. Koheleth thus gave himself to a foolish life, yet tempered by wisdom, till there dawned upon him a better light upon the way to true happiness.<p>The expression of the donec viderem is old Heb. Instead of &#1488;&#1497;&#1470;&#1494;&#1492; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, quidnam sit bonum in indirect interrog. (as <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>), the old form &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; (<a href="/hebrews/6-12.htm">Hebrews 6:12</a>) would lie at least nearer. Asher ya&#780;a&#780;su may be rendered: quod faciant or ut faciant; after <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a>, the latter is to be assumed. The accus. designation of time, "through the number of days of their life," is like <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>. We have not, indeed, to translate with Knobel: "the few days of their life," but yet there certainly lies in &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; the idea that the days of man's life are numbered, and that thus even if they are not few but many (<a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>), they do not endure for ev.<p>The king now, in the verse following, relates his undertakings for the purpose of gaining the joys of life in fellowship with wisdom, and first, how he made architecture and gardening serviceable to this new style of life. </body></html>
