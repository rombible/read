Not strictly and simply understood, since life is the gift of God; and a great blessing it is, more than raiment, and so dear to a man, that he will give all he has for it: but comparatively, in comparison of the lovingkindness of God, which is better than life; or in comparison of eternal life, which a good man desires to depart from this world, for the sake of enjoying it. The sense seems to be this, that since the case of wise men and fools was equal, he had the less love for life, the less regard to it, the less desire to continue in it; no solid happiness being to be enjoyed in anything under the sun: though some think that he was even weary of life, impatient of it, as Job, Jonah, and others have been. The Targum is, <p>"I hate all evil life:'' <p>Alshech interprets it of the good things of this world, which were the cause of hurt unto him; and Aben Ezra understands, by life, living persons; <p>because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me; which was either wrought by himself; particularly his hard studies, and eager pursuits after knowledge and wisdom, which were a weariness to his flesh; or which were done by others, especially evil ones: so the Targum, <p>"for evil to me is an evil work, which is done by the children of men under the sun in this world;'' <p>for all is vanity and vexation of spirit; See Gill on <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Therefore I hated life</span>] Better, <span class="bld">And I hated.</span> Of such a temper, the extremest form of pessimism, suicide would seem the natural and logical outcome. In practice, however, the sages who have thus moralized, from Koheleth to Schopenhauer, have found life worth living for, even when they were proving that it was hateful. Even the very utterance of the thought has been a relief, or, like Hamlet, they have been deterred by the vague terror of the “something after death” which their scepticism cannot quite shake off. The actual self-murderers are those who cannot weave their experiences into poems and confessions, and find the burden of life, including its sin and shame, more than they can bear. It may be questioned whether mere weariness of life, able to find vent for itself in verse or prose, has ever led to suicide. The man, as here, seems to come to the very verge of it, and then draws back. It is suggestive that in the history of Greek and Roman philosophy suicide was more frequent and more honoured among the Stoics than the Epicureans (Zeller, <span class="ital">Stoics and Epic.</span> c. xii.). The recurrence of the burden “vanity and <span class="bld">feeding upon wind</span>” rings, as it were, the death-knell of life and hope.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I hated life;</span> <span class="accented">et idcirce taeduit me vitae meae</span>. Be a man wise or foolish, his life leads only to one end and is soon forgotten; hence life itself is burdensome and hateful. The bitter complaint of Job (<a href="/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20</a>, etc.; Job 6:8, 9) is here echoed, though the words do not point to suicide as the solution of the riddle. It is the <span class="accented">ennui</span> and unprofitableness of all life and action in view of the inevitable conclusion, which is here lamented. <span class="cmt_word">Because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for evil unto me</span> (<a href="/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a>) <span class="accented">is the work which is done under the sun</span>. The toil and exertions of men pressed upon him like a burden too heavy for him to bear.

The apostle teaches a 'better lesson, and the worker who adopts his rule is saved from this crushing disappointment: "<span class="accented">Whatsoever</span> ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ" (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all is vanity.</span> He comes back to the same miserable refrain; it is all emptiness, striving after wind. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But was this &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; a &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; - was this gain that fell to him a true, satisfying, pure gain? With the words uphanithi ani he proposes this question, and answers it. &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; (to turn to) is elsewhere followed by expressions of motion to an end; here, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/6-28.htm">Job 6:28</a>, by &#1489;&#1468;, by virtue of a constructio praegnans: I turned myself, fixing my attention on all my works which my hands accomplished. La'asoth is, as at <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> (vid., l.c.), equivalent to perficiendo, carrying out, viz., such works of art and of all his labour. The exclamation "behold" introduces the summa summarum. Regarding&#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, vid., <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>. Also this way of finding out that which was truly good showed itself to be false. Of all this enjoyment, there remained nothing but the feeling of emptiness. What he strove after appeared to him as the wind; the satisfaction he sought to obtain at such an expense was nothing else than a momentary delusion. And since in this search after the true happiness of life he was in a position more favourable for such a purpose than almost any other man, he is constrained to draw the conclusion that there is no &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, i.e., no real enduring and true happiness, from all labour under the sun. </body></html>
