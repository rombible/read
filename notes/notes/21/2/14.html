And so are the eyes of every man; but the sense is, he makes use of them, he looks about him, and walks circumspectly; he takes heed to his goings, he foresees the evil, and avoids it; or the danger he is exposed unto, and guards against it. Some understand it, in a more spiritual and evangelical sense, of Christ, who is the head of the body the church, and of every true believer; of everyone that is wise unto salvation, whose eyes are on him alone for righteousness, salvation, and eternal life; or on whom Christ's eyes are; who is said to have seven eyes, with which he guides, guards, and protects his people; <p>but the fool walketh in darkness; his eyes are to the ends of the earth; he walks incautiously, without any circumspection or guard; he knows not where he is, nor where he is going, nor where he shall set his foot next, nor at what he may stumble; wherefore a wise man is to be preferred to a fool, as wisdom is to folly. The Midrash interprets the wise man of Abraham, and the fool of Nimrod; <p>and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all; the wise man and the fool; or, "but I myself perceived" (w), &amp;c. though it is allowed that a wise man is better than a fool; yet this also must be owned, which Solomon's experience proved, and every man's does, that the same things befall wise men and fools; they are liable to the same diseases of body, and disasters of life; to poverty and distress, to loss of estate, children, and friends, and to death itself. <p>(w) "sed agnovi", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "sed cognovi", Rambachius; "but I saw", Broughton. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The wise man's <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> eyes <i>are</i> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> event happeneth to them all.</span><p>(i) Meaning, in this world.<p>(k) For both die and are forgotten as in Ec 2:16 or they both alike have prosperity or adversity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">The wise man’s eyes are in his head</span>] The figurative language is so much of the nature of an universal parable that we need hardly look to any special source for it, but we are at least reminded of those that “walk on still in darkness,” who have eyes and yet “see not” in any true sense of seeing (<a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm" title="Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.">Isaiah 6:10</a>).

Wisdom is better than folly. True, but for how long? With an emphasized stress on his own personal reflections, he goes on, “Yes, I myself, learning it for myself, and not as a topic of the schools, saw that there is one event for the wise and for the fool.” In a few short years the difference in which the former exults will vanish, and both will be on the same level. So sang the Epicurean poet:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Omnes una manet nox,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Et calcanda semel via lethi.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“One dark black night awaits us all;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>One path of death we all must tread.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hor. <span class="ital">Od.</span> i. 28. 15.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh 'in darkness.</span> This clause is closely connected with the preceding verse, showing how wisdom excelleth folly. The wise man has the eyes of his heart or understanding enlightened (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>); he looks into the nature of things, fixes his regard on what is most important, sees where to go; while the fool's eyes are in the ends of the earth (<a href="/proverbs/17-24.htm">Proverbs 17:24</a>); he walks on still in darkness, stumbling as he goes, knowing not whither his road shall take him. <span class="cmt_word">And I myself also</span> (<span class="accented">I even I</span>) <span class="cmt_word">perceived that one event happeneth to them all.</span> "Event" (<span class="accented">mikreh</span>); <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">interitus</span> (Vulgate); not chance, But death, the final event. The word is translated "hap" in <a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>, and "chance" in <a href="/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>; but the connection here points to a definite termination; nor would it be consistent with Koheleth's religion to refer this termination to fate or accident. With all his experience, he could only conclude that in one important aspect the observed superiority of wisdom to folly was illusory and vain. He saw with his own eyes, and needed no instructor to teach, that both wise and fool must succumb to death, the universal leveler.

Segu&#772;llah (from sagal, Targ., to make oneself possess), properly possession, and that something which specially and peculiarly belongs to one as his property; the word is here meant collect., as at <a href="/1_chronicles/29-3.htm">1 Chronicles 29:3</a> : that which only kings and individual countries possess. The interchange of melachim, which is without the article, with the determ. hammedinoth, is arbitrary: something special, such as that which a king possesses, the specialities which countries possess, - one country this, and another that. The hammedinoth are certainly not exclusively the regions embraced within the dominion of Solomon (Zckl.), as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>, the Persian kingdom was divided into 127 medinoth. Solomon had a fleet which went to Ophir, was in a friendly relation with the royal house of Tyre, the metropolis of many colonies, and ruled over a widely-extended kingdom, bound by commerce with Central Asia and Africa. - His desires had thus ample opportunity to stretch beyond the limits of his own kingdom, and facilities enough for procuring the peculiar natural and artistic productions which other lands could boast of. Medinah is, first of all, a country, not as a territory, but as under one government (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a>); in the later philosophical language it is the Heb. word for the Greek &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; in the passage before us, medinoth is, however, not different from &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;.<p>From the singing men and singing women who come into view here, not as appertaining to the temple service (vid., the Targ.), with which no singing women were connected, but as connected with the festivities of the court (<a href="/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>), advance is made to shiddah veshiddoth; and since these are designated by the preceding &#1493;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1490;&#1493;&#1514; (not &#1493;&#1514;&#1506;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) bene ha&#772;a&#772;dam, especially as objects and means of earthly pleasure, and since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm">Hebrews 2:7</a>, sexual love is the fairest and the most pleasant, in a word, the most attractive of all earthly delights (Solomon's luxus, also here contradicting the law of the king, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, came to a height, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>, after the example of Oriental rulers, in a harem of not fewer than one thousand women, princesses and concubines), of necessity, the expression shiddah veshiddoth must denote a multitude of women whom the king possessed for his own pleasure. Cup-bearers, male and female (Syr., lxx), cannot at all be understood, for although it may be said that the enumeration thus connects itself with the before-named &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, yet this class of female attendants are not numbered among the highest human pleasures; besides, with such an explanation one must read &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, and, in addition, &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1488; (to throw, to pour to, or pour out), to which this Heb. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492; may correspond, is nowhere used of the pouring out of wine. Rather might &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492;, like &#1513;&#1491;&#1488;, hydria, be the name of a vessel from which one pours out anything, according to which Aq. translates by &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, Symmachus, after Jerome, by mensurarum (read mensarum)<p>(Note: Thus, according to Vallarsi, a Cod. Vat. and Cod. Palat. of the first hand.)<p>species et appositioines, and Jerome, scyphos et urceos in ministerio ad vina fundenda; but this word for kele&#772; mashke&#772;h, <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a> ( equals  <a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>), is not found. Also the Targ., which translates by dimasaya uve&#772; venavan, public baths (&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;), and balneae, vindicates this translation by referring the word to the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1488;, "with pipes which pour out (&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;) tepid water, and pipes which pour out hot water." But this explanation is imaginary; &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; occurs in the Mishna, Mikwaoth (of plunge-baths) <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:5</a>, but there it denotes a chest which, when it swims in the water, makes the plunge-bath unsuitable. Such an untenable conceit also is the translation suggested by Kimchi, &#1499;&#1500;&#1497; &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;, according to which the Event. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (in a musical sense: concentus), and Luther: "all kinds of musical instruments;" the word has not this meaning; Orelli, Sanchuniathon, p. 33, combines therewith &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, according to the Phoenician myth, the inventress of the artistic song. The explanation by Kimchi is headed, "Splendour of every kind;" Ewald, Elster, and Zckler find therein a general expression, following taanugoth: great heap and heaps  equals  in great abundance [die Hlle und Flle]. But the synon. of &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, "splendour," is not &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, but &#1506;&#1494;; and that &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;, like &#1506;&#1510;&#1501;, is referred to a great number, is without proof. Thus shiddah veshiddoth will denote something definite; besides, "a large number" finds its expression in the climactic union of words. In the Jerus. Talm. Taanith <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5</a>, shiddah must, according to the gloss, be the name of a chariot, although the subject there is not that of motion forward, or moving quickly; it is there announced that Schn, not far from Sepphoris, a place famed also for its pottery, formerly possessed 80 such shiddoth wholly of metal. The very same word is explained by Rashi, Baba kamma ix. 3, Shabbath 120a, Erubin 30b, Gittin 8b, 68a, Chagiga 25a, and elsewhere, of a carriage of wood, and especially of a chariot for women and distinguished persons. The combination of the synonyms, shiddah uthivah umigdal, does not in itself mean more than a chest; and Rashi himself explains, Kethuboth 65a, quolphi dashidah of the lock of a chest (argaz); and the author of Aruch knows no other meaning than that of a repository such as a chest. But in passages such as Gittin 8b, the shiddah is mentioned as a means of transport; it is to all appearance a chest going on wheels, moved forward by means of wheels, but on that very account not a state-chariot. Rashi's tradition cannot be verified.<p>Bttcher, in the Neue Aehrenlese, adduces for comparison the Syr. Shydlo, which, according to Castelli, signifies navis magna, corbita, arca; but from a merchant ship and a portable chest, it is a great way to a lady's palanquin.<p>He translates: palanquin and palinquins  equals  one consignment to the harem after another. Gesen., according to Rdiger, Thes. 1365b, thinks that women are to be understood; for he compares the Arab. z'ynat, which signifies a women's carriage, and then the woman herself (cf. our Frauenzimmer, women's apartment, women, like Odaliske, from the Turk. oda, apartment). But this all stands or falls with that gloss of Rashi's: 'agalah lemerkavoth nashim usarim. Meanwhile, of all the explanations as yet advanced, this last of splendid coaches, palanquins is the best; for it may certainly be supposed that the words shiddah veshiddoth are meant of women. Aben Ezra explains on this supposition, shiddoth  equals  shevuyoth, females captured in war; but unwarrantably, because as yet Solomon had not been engaged in war; others (vid., Pinsker's Zur Gesch. des Karaismus, p. 296), recently Bullock, connect it with shadim, in the sense of (Arab.) nahidah (a maiden with swelling breast); Knobel explains after shadad, to barricade, to shut up, occlusa, the female held in custody (cf. bethulah, the separated one, virgin, from bathal, cogn. badal); Hitzig, "cushions," "bolsters," from shanad, which, like (Arab.) firash, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, is then transferred to the juncta toro. Nothing of all that is satisfactory. The Babyl. Gemara, Gittin 68a, glosses &#1493;&#1514;&#1506;&#1503; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; by "reservoirs and baths," and then further says that in the west (Palestine) they say &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;, chests (according to Rashi: chariots); but that here in this country (i.e., in Babylon) they translate shiddah veshiddoth by she&#772;dah veshe&#772;dathin, which is then explained, "demons and demonesses," which Solomon had made subservient to him.<p>(Note: A demon, and generally a superhuman being, is called, as in Heb. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, so in the Babyl.-Assyr. si&#770;du, vid., Norris' Assyrian Dictionary, II p.  cf. Schrader, in the Jena. Lit. Zeit. 1874, p. 218f., according to which si&#770;du, with alap, is the usual name of Adar formed like an ox.)<p>This haggadic-mytholog. interpretation is, linguistically at least, on the right track. A demon is not so named from fluttering or moving to and fro (Levy, Schnhak), for there is no evidence in the Semitic langauge of the existence of a verb &#1513;&#1493;&#1491;, to flee; also not from a verb sadad, which must correspond to the Heb. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492;, in the sense of to adore (Oppert's Inscription du palais de Khorsabad, 1863, p. 96); for this meaning is more than doubtful, and, besides, &#1513;&#1473;&#1491; is an active, and not a passive idea-much rather &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, Assyr. si&#770;d, Arab. sayyid, signifies the mighty, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to force, <a href="/psalms/91-6.htm">Psalm 91:6</a>.<p>(Note: Vid., Friedrich Delitzsch's Assyr. Theirnamen, p. 37.)<p>In the Arab. (cf. the Spanish Cid) it is uniformly the name of a lord, as subduing, ruling, mastering (sabid), and the fem. sayyidat, of a lady, whence the vulgar Arab. sitti  equals  my lady, and si&#770;di  equals  my lord. Since &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; means the same as &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1491;, and in Heb. is more commonly used than it, so also the fem. form &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; is possible, so much the more as it may have originated from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492;, 5 &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1491;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, by a sharpening contraction, like &#1505;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1505;&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501; (Olsh. 83c), perhaps intentionally to make &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492;, a demoness, and the name of a lady (donna  equals  domina) unlike. Accordingly we translate, with Gesen. and Meyer in their Handwrt.: "lady and ladies;" for we take shiddoth as a name of the ladies of the harem, like she&#772;glath (Assyr. sakla&#770;ti) and lehhenath in the book of Daniel, on which Ahron b. Joseph the Karaite remarks: shedah hinqaroth shagal.<p>The connection expressing an innumerable quantity, and at the same time the greatest diversity, is different from the genitival dor dorim, generation of generations, i.e., lasting through all generations, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>, from the permutative heightening the idea: rahham rahhamathaim, one damsel, two damsels, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-30.htm">Judges 5:30</a>, and from that formed by placing together the two gram. genders, comprehending every species of the generic conception: mash'e&#772;n umash'enah, <a href="/isaiah/3-3.htm">Isaiah 3:3</a> (vid., comm. l.c., and Ewald, 172b). Also the words cited by Ewald (Syr.), rogo urogo, "all possible pleasures" (Cureton's Spicil. p. 10), do not altogether accord with this passage for they heighten, like meod meod, by the repetition of the same expression. But similar is the Arab. scheme, mal wamwal, "possession and possessions," i.e., exceeding great riches, where the collective idea, in itself according by its indetermination free scope to the imagination, is multiplied by the plur. being further added.<p>After Koheleth has enumerated all that he had provided for the purpose of gratifying his lusts, but without losing himself therein, he draws the conclusion, which on this occasion also shows a perceptible deficit. </body></html>
