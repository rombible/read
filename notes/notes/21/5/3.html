We should avoid vain repetitions; copious prayers are not here condemned, but those that are unmeaning.

As much "business," engrossing the mind, gives birth to incoherent "dreams," so many words, uttered inconsiderately in prayer, give birth to and betray "a fool's speech" (Ec 10:14), [Holden and Weiss]. But Ec 5:7 implies that the "dream" is not a comparison, but the vain thoughts of the fool (sinner, Ps 73:20), arising from multiplicity of (worldly) "business." His "dream" is that God hears him for his much speaking (Mt 6:7), independently of the frame of mind [English Version and Maurer].<p>fool's voice&#8212;answers to "dream" in the parallel; it comes by the many "words" flowing from the fool's "dream."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> When men’s minds are distracted and oppressed with too much business in the day, they dream of it in the night. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A fool’s voice is known; </span> it discovers the man to be a foolish, and rash, and inconsiderate man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By multitude of words; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Or, "for as a dream" (q), so Aben Ezra; as that comes through a multiplicity of business in the daytime, in which the mind has been busied, and the body employed; and this brings on dreams in the night season, which are confused and incoherent; sometimes the fancy is employed about one thing, and sometimes another, and all unprofitable and useless, as well as vain and foolish; <p>and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words; either his voice in conversation, for a fool is full of words, and pours out his foolishness in a large profusion of them; or his voice in prayer, being like a man's dream, confused, incoherent, and rambling.

The mind that has lost the power to re-collect itself, haunted and harassed by the cares of many things, cannot enjoy the sweet and calm repose of a dreamless slumber, and that fevered state with its hot thoughts and wild fancies is but too faithful a picture of the worshipper who pours out a multitude of wishes in a “multitude of words.” His very prayers are those of a dreamer. It seems obvious, from the particle that connects this with the preceding verse, that the maxim refers specially to these utterances of the fool and not merely to the folly of his speech in general. The words “is known,” as the italics shew, have nothing answering to them in the Hebrew. The same verb was meant to serve for both the clauses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The first clause illustrates the second, the mark of comparison being simply the copula, mere juxtaposition being deemed sufficient to denote the similitude, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For a dream cometh through</span> (<span class="accented">in consequence of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the multitude of business.</span> The verse is meant to confirm the injunction against vain babbling in prayer. Cares and anxieties in business or other matters occasion disturbed sleep, murder the dreamless repose of the healthy laborer, and produce all kinds of sick fancies and imaginations. Septuagint, "A dream cometh in abundance of trial (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Multas curas sequuntur somnia</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And a fool's voice is known by multitude of words</span>. The verb should be supplied from the first clause, and not a new one introduced, as in the Authorized Version, "And the voice of a fool (cometh) in consequence of many words." As surely as excess of business produces fevered dreams, so excess of words, especially in addresses to God, produces a fool's voice, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. foolish speech. St. Gregory points out the many ways in which the mind is affected by images from dreams. "Sometimes," he says, "dreams are engendered of fullness or emptiness of the belly, sometimes of illusion, sometimes of illusion and thought combined, sometimes of revelation, while sometimes they are engendered of imagination, thought, and revelation together" ('Moral.,' 8:42). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Better is a youth poor and wise, than a king old and foolish, who no longer understands how to be warned," - i.e., who increases his folly by this, that he is "wise in his own eyes," <a href="/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12</a>; earlier, as &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; denotes, he was, in some measure, accessible to the instruction of others in respect of what was wanting to him; but now in his advanced age he is hardened in his folly, bids defiance to all warning counsel, and undermines his throne. The connection of the verb &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; with &#1500; and the inf. (for which elsewhere only the inf. is used) is a favourite form with the author; it means to know anything well, <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:8</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15</a>; here is meant an understanding resting on the knowledge of oneself and on the knowledge of men. &#1504;&#1494;&#1492;&#1512; is here and at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>, a Niph. tolerativum, such as the synon. &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512;, <a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a> : to let oneself be cleared up, made wiser, enlightened, warned. After this contrast, the idea connected with &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; also defines itself. A young man (&#1497;&#1500;&#1491;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>, but also <a href="/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>) is meant who (vid., above, p. 639, under misken) yet excels the old imbecile and childish king, in that he perceives the necessity of a fundamental change in the present state of public matters, and knows how to master the situation to such a degree that he raises himself to the place of ruler over the neglected community. </body></html>
