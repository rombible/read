By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to suffer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He live - Rather, he hath lived. "He" refers to the man <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>. His want of satisfaction in life, and the dishonor done to his corpse, are regarded as such great evils that they counterbalance his numerous children, and length of days, and render his lot viewed as a whole no better than the common lot of all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. If the miser's length of "life" be thought to raise him above the abortive, Solomon answers that long life, without enjoying real good, is but lengthened misery, and riches cannot exempt him from going whither "all go."

Or two thousand years, which no man ever did, nor even one thousand years; Methuselah, the oldest man, did not live so long as that; this is than twice the age of the oldest man: there is one sort of the Ethiopians, who are said (a) to live almost half space of time longer than usual, called from thence Macrobii; which Pliny (b) makes to be one hundred and forty years, which is just double the common term of life. This here is only a supposition. Aben Ezra interprets it, "a thousand thousand", but wrongly; so the Arabic version, "though he lives many thousand years"; <p>yet hath he seen no good, not enjoyed the good of his labour, what he has been labouring for and was possessed of; and therefore has lived so long as he has to very little purpose, and with very little comfort or credit; and especially he has had no experience of spiritual good; <p>do not all go to one place? that is, the grave; they do, even all men; it is the house appointed for all living, <a href="/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>; and hither go both the abortive, and the covetous rich man; so that he has in this no pre-eminence to it.

Carry it to the furthest point conceivable, and still the result is the same. The longer it is, the fuller of misery and woe. The thought finds, as before, a parallel in the speech of Solon to Crœsus (Herod. i. 32). The man goes to the same place,—to the dark, dreary world of Sheol, perhaps even to a more entire annihilation than was implied in the Hebrew thought of that unseen world,—as the abortive birth, with nothing but an accumulated experience of wretchedness. Depression could go no further. See the poem of Omar Khayyam in the <span class="ital">Appendix</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good</span>. What has been said would still be true even if the man lived two thousand years. The second clause is not the apodosis (as the Authorized Version makes it), but the continuation of the protasis: if he lived the longest life, "and saw not good;" the conclusion is given in the form of a question. The "good" is the enjoyment of life spoken of in ver. 3 (see on Ecclesiastes 2:1). The specified time seems to refer to the age of the patriarchs, none of whom, from Adam to Noah, reached half the limit assigned. <span class="cmt_word">Do not all go to one place</span>? viz. to Sheol, the grave (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>). If a long life were spent in calm enjoyment, it might be preferable to a short one; but when it is passed amid care and annoyance and discontent, it is no better than that which begins and ends in nothingness. The grave receives both, and there is nothing to choose between them, at least in this point of view. Of life as in itself a blessing, a discipline, a school, Koheleth says nothing here; he puts himself in the place of the discontented rich man, and appraises life with his eyes. On the common destiny that awaits peer and peasant, rich and poor, happy and sorrow-laden, we can all remember utterances old and new. Thus Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3. 20 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho,<br />Nil interest, an pauper et infima<br />De gente sub dive moreris,<br />Victima nil miserantis Orci.<br />"Omnes eodem cogimur."</span> Ovid, 'Met.,' 10:33 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Omnia debentur vobis, paullumque morati<br />Serius aut citius sedem properamus ad unam.<br />Tendimus huc omnes, haec est domus ultima."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Fate is the lord of all things; soon or late<br />To one abode we speed, thither we all<br />Pursue our way, this is our final home."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Over this enjoyment he forgets the frailty and the darkened side of this life. It proves itself to be a gift of God, a gift from above: "For he doth not (then) think much of the days of his life; because God answereth the joy of his heart." Such an one, permitted by God to enjoy this happiness of life, is thereby prevented from tormenting himself by reflections regarding its transitoriness. Incorrectly, Hengst.: Remembrance and enjoyment of this life do not indeed last long, according to Ewald, who now, however, rightly explains: He will not, by constant reflection on the brevity of his life, too much embitter this enjoyment; because God, indeed, grants to him true heart-joy as the fairest gift. The meaning of <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a> is also, in general, hit upon. The lxx translates: "because God occupies him with the joy of his heart;" but for that we ought to have had the word &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;; Jerome helps it, for he reads &#1489;&#1513;&#1502;&#1492;&#1492; instead of &#1489;&#1513;&#1502;&#1495;&#1514;: eo quod Deus occupet deliciis cor ejus. But also, in this form, this explanation of &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; is untenable; for &#1489; &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, the causat. of which would be &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, signifies, in the style of Koheleth, not in general to busy oneself with something, but to weary oneself with something; hence &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474; cannot mean: to be occupied with joy, and thereby to be drawn away from some other thing. And since the explanation: "he makes him sing," needs to argument to dispose of it, &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; thus remains only as the Hiph. of &#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, to meet, to respond to, grant a request. Accordingly, Hitz., like Aben Ezra and Kimchi, comparing <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>.: God makes to answer, i.e., so works that all things which have in or of themselves that which can make him glad, must respond to his wish. But the omission of the obj. - of which Hitz. remarks, that because indefinite it is left indefinite - is insufferably hard, and the explanation thus ambiguous. Most interpreters translate: for God answers (Gesen. He. Wrt. B., incorrectly: answered) him with joy of his heart, i.e., grants this to him in the way of answer. Ewald compares <a href="/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a>; but that affords no voucher for the expression: to answer one with something  equals  to grant it to him; for &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; is there connected with a double accus., and &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511; is the adv. statement of the way and manner. But above all, against this interpretation is the fact of the want of the personal obj. The author behoved to have written &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;. We take the Hiph. as in the sense of the Kal, but give it its nearest signification: to answer, and explain, as in a similar manner Seb. Schmid, Rambam, and others have already done: God answers to the joy of his heart, i.e., He assents to it, or (using an expression which is an exact equivalent), He corresponds to it. This makes the joy a heart-joy, i.e., a joy which a man feels not merely externally, but in the deepest recess of his heart, for the joy penetrates his heart and satisfies it (Sol 3:11; <a href="/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>). A similar expression, elsewhere not found, we had at <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a> in &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;. Why should not &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489; (&#1492;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;) be possible with &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, just as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9; is with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;? For the rest, &#1489;&#1513; &#1500;&#1489; is not needed as obj.; we can take it also as an expression of the state or condition: God gives answer in the heart-joy of such an one. In &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to answer, to hear the answer, is thought of as granting a request; here, as giving assent to. <a href="/job/35-9.htm">Job 35:9</a> affords a twofold suitable example, that the Hiph. can have an enlarged Kal signification.<p>After the author has taken the opportunity of once more expressing his ultimatum, he continues to register the sad evils that cling to wealth. </body></html>
