The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give satisfaction. The poor man has comfort as well as the richest, and is under no real disadvantage. We cannot say, Better is the sight of the eyes than the resting of the soul in God; for it is better to live by faith in things to come, than to live by sense, which dwells only upon present things. Our lot is appointed. We have what pleases God, and let that please us. The greatest possessions and honours cannot set us above the common events of human life. Seeing that the things men pursue on earth increase vanities, what is man the better for his worldly devices? Our life upon earth is to be reckoned by days. It is fleeting and uncertain, and with little in it to be fond of, or to be depended on. Let us return to God, trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ, and submit to his will. Then soon shall we glide through this vexatious world, and find ourselves in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What - literally, what profit (as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>).<p>Knoweth ... living - i. e., "Knows how to conduct himself rightly among his contemporaries." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

In that wandering, there is once more the <span class="bld">feeding upon wind.</span> Perhaps, however, that sentence is passed with an intentional ambiguity, characteristic of the writer (see note on <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-9.htm" title="Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 6:9</a>), upon the actual present enjoyment, as well as on the unsatisfied desire, or upon the bare fact that the former with its lower aims is better than the latter with its higher ones.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire</span> (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "the soul," ver. 7). This is a further confirmation of the misery and unrest that accompany immoderate desires. "The sight of the eyes" means the enjoyment of the present, that which lies before one, in contrast to the restless craving for what is distant, uncertain, and out of reach. The lesson taught is to make the best of existing circumstances, to enjoy the present, to control the roaming of fancy, and to narrow the vast field of appetency. We have a striking expression in Wisd. 4:12, <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> by which is denoted the giddiness, the reeling intoxication, caused by unrestrained passion.

Upon the whole, life is but short, therefore be just and prudent, and make your most of it; and when you divert yourself, be always on your guard' (J. Collier). Well is it added that this insatiability of the soul, which never leads to contentment, is vanity and vexation of spirit, a feeding on wind, empty, unsatisfying. Commentators refer in illustration to the fable of the dog and the shadow, and the proverb, A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"If a man begat an hundred, and lived many years, and the amount of the days of his years was great, and his soul satisfied not itself in good, and also he had no grave, then I:say: Better than he is the untimely birth." The accentuation of 3a is like that of 2a. The disjunctives follow the Athnach, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>, only that there Telisha Gedhola stands for Pazer. Hitzig finds difficulty with the clause &#1500;&#1493; ... &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;&#1470;, and regards it as a marginal gloss to 5a, taken up into the text at a wrong place. But just the unexpected form and the accidental nature, more than the inward necessity of this feature in the figure, leads us to conclude that the author here connects together historical facts, as conjecturally noted above, into one fanciful picture. &#1502;&#1488;&#1492; is obviously to be supplemented by (&#1493;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;) &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; the Targ. and Midrash make this man to be Cain, Ahab, Haman, and show at least in this that they extend down into the time of the Persian kingdom a spark of historical intelligence. &#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468; interchanges with &#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1492;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:8</a>, as at <a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>. In order to designate the long life emphatically, the author expresses the years particularly in days: "and if it is much which (Heiligst.: multum est quod) the days of his years amount to;" cf. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>. With venaphsho there follows the reverse side of this long life with many children: (1) his soul satisfies not itself, i.e., has no self-satisfying enjoyment of the good (min, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>, etc.), i.e., of all the good things which he possesses, - in a word, he is not happy in his life; and (2) an honourable burial is not granted to him, but &#1511;&#1489; &#1495;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>, which is the contrary of a burial such as becomes a man (the body of Artaxerxes Ochus was thrown to the cats); whereupon Elster rightly remarks that in an honourable burial and an honourable remembrance, good fortune, albeit shaded with sadness, might be seen. But when now, to one so rich in children and so long-lived, neither enjoyment of his good fortune nor even this shaded glory of an honourable burial is allowed, the author cannot otherwise judge than that the untimely birth is better than he. In this section regarding the uncertainty of riches, we have already, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:14</a>, fallen on a reminiscence from the Book of Job; it is so much the more probable that here also <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a> has an influence on the formation of the thought. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is the foetus which comes lifeless from the mother's womb. </body></html>
