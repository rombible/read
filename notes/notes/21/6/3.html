By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use. And he who has entered on life only for one moment, to quit it the next, has a preferable lot to him who has lived long, but only to suffer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No burial - For a corpse to lie unburied was a circumstance in itself of special ignominy and dishonor (compare the marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Instead of being childless the rich man may have children, and children’s children; may live out all his days. What then? Unless his “soul be filled with good,” unless there is the capacity for enjoyment, life is not worth living. Still, as before, “it were good never to have been born.” We may probably trace an allusive reference to Artaxerxes Mnemon, who is reported to have had 115 children, and who died of grief at the age of 94, at the suicide of one of his sons, and the murder of another, both caused by a third son, Ochus, who succeeded him (Justin, x. 1).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and also that he have no burial</span>] The sequence of thought seems at first strange. Why should this be, from the writer’s standpoint, as the climax of sorrow? Why should he who had noted so keenly the vanities of life put seemingly so high a value on that which comes when life is over and done with? Some writers have felt this so strongly, that they have suggested the interpretation, “<span class="ital">even if there be no grave waiting for him,” i.e.</span> even if he were to live for ever. The natural meaning is, however, tenable enough, and we have once more an echo of Greek teaching. Solon had taught that we are not to call any man happy before his death, and by implication, in his story of the sons of Tellus, had made the prospect of posthumous honour an element of happiness (Herod. i. 30). So, in like manner, it was the direst of woes for a man to know that he “should be buried with the burial of an ass” (<a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm" title="He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 22:19</a>), or, in Homeric phrase, that his body should be “cast out to dogs and vultures.” How could any man, however rich and powerful, be sure that that fate might not be in store for him? On the assumption of the late date of the book, there may be a reference to the death of Artaxerxes Ochus, who was murdered by the eunuch Bagoas, and his body thrown to the cats. Possibly, Koheleth himself may have had some reason for an anxious doubt, whether the honours of sepulture would be his. If, as seems likely, he was a stranger in a strange land, alone and with no child to succeed him, perhaps with a name cast out as evil or heretical, there was small chance of his being laid to rest in the sepulchre of his fathers. See the “Ideal Biography,” <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, ch. iii.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an untimely birth is better than he</span>] The thought of ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm" title="Yes, better is he than both they, which has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a> is reproduced, but in a somewhat less generalized form. There, never to have been born, is asserted, after the manner of the Greek maxims quoted in the notes, to be better than existence of any kind. Here the assertion is limited to the comparison with the joyless pursuit of wealth. The “untimely birth” was the natural emblem of all abortive enterprise (<a href="/job/3-16.htm" title="Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-8.htm" title="As a snail which melts, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.">Psalm 58:8</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a man beget an hundred children</span>. Another case is supposed, differing from,the preceding one, where the rich man dies childless. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. "Sons,' or "children," must be supplied (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>). To have a large family was regarded as a great blessing. The "hundred" is a round number, though we read of some fathers who had nearly this number of children; thus Ahab had seventy sons (<a href="/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1</a>), Rehoboam eighty-eight children (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>). Plumptre follows some commentators in seeing here an allusion to Artaxerxes Mnemon, who is said to have had a hundred and fifteen children, and died of grief at the age of ninety-four at the suicide of one son and the murder of another. Wordsworth opines that Solomon, in the previous verse, was thinking of Jeroboam, who, it was revealed unto him, should, stranger as he was, seize and enjoy his inheritance. But these historical references are the merest guesswork, and rest upon no substantial basis. Plainly the author's statement is general, and there is no need to ransack history to find its parallel. <span class="cmt_word">And live many years, so that the days of his years be many</span>; <span class="accented">Et vixerit multos annos</span>, <span class="accented">et plures dies aetatis habuerit</span> (Vulgate). These versions seem to be simply tautological. The second clause is climacteric, as Ginsburg renders, "Yea, numerous as may be the days of his years." The whole extent of years is summed up in days. So <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>, "The days of our years are three score years and ten," etc. Long life, again, was deemed a special blessing, as we see in the commandment with promise (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">yet if</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his soul not filled with good</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he does not satisfy himself with the enjoyment of all the good things which he possesses. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "And his soul shall not be satisfied with his good." <span class="cmt_word">And also that he have no burial.</span> This is the climax of the evil that befalls him. Some critics, not entering into Koheleth's view of the severity of this calamity, translate, "and even if the grave did not wait for him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "if he were never to die," if he were immortal. But there is no parallel to show that the clause can have this meaning; and we know, without having recourse to Greek precedents, that the want of burial was reckoned a grievous loss and dishonor. Hence comes the common allusion to dead carcasses being left to be devoured by beasts and birds, instead of meeting with honorable burial in the ancestral graves (<a href="/1_kings/13-22.htm">1 Kings 13:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18-20</a>). Thus David says to his giant foe, "I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth" (<a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>); and about Jehoiakim it was denounced that he should not be lamented when he died: "He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). The lot of the rich man in question is proclaimed with ever-increasing misery. Ha cannot enjoy his possessions; he has none to whom to leave them; his memory perishes; he has no honored burial. <span class="cmt_word">I say, that an untimely birth is better than he</span> (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>). The abortion or still-born child is preferable to one whose destiny is so miserable (see <a href="/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>). It is preferable because, although it has missed all the pleasures of life, it has at least escaped all suffering. The next two verses illustrate this position. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Also all his life long he eateth in darkness and grieveth himself much, and oh for his sorrow and hatred!"

It is meant that all his life long he ate &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, the bread of sorrow, or &#1500;&#1495;&#1509; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, prison fare; he did not allow himself pleasant table comforts in a room comfortably or splendidly lighted, for it is unnecessary to understand &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; subjectively and figuratively (Hitz., Zck.).<p>In 16b the traditional punctuation is &#1493;&#1499;&#1506;&#1505;.<p>(Note: Thus in correct texts, in H. with the note: &#1499; &#1502;&#1500;&#1512;&#1506;, viz., here and at <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-10.htm">Psalm 112:10</a>, only there &#1506; has, according to tradition, the Kametz.

Ewald, Burger, and Bttch. read only &#1493;&#1499;&#1506;&#1505; &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;; but &#1500;&#1493; is not to be dispensed with, and can easily be reduced to a mere vav. Elster retains &#1493;&#1499;&#1506;&#1505;, and reads, like Hitzig, &#1489;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;: he grieves himself much in his sorrow and wrath; but in that case the word &#1493;&#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1493; was to be expected; also in this way the ideas do not psychologically accord with each other. However the text is taken, we must interpret &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1511;&#1510;&#1507; as an exclamation, like &#1492;&#1507;, <a href="/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; &#1514;&#1468;&#1507;, <a href="/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16</a>; Ewald, 328a, as we have done above. That &#1493;&#1495; of itself is a subst. clause  equals  &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493; is untenable; the rendering of the noun as forming a clause, spoken of under <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:21</a>, is of a different character.<p>(Note: Rashi regards &#1493;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; as a form like &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;. This o everywhere appears only in a gen. connection.)<p>He who by his labour and care aims at becoming rich, will not only lay upon himself unnecessary privations, but also have many sorrows; for many of his plans fail, and the greater success of others awakens his envy, and neither he himself nor others satisfy him; he is morbidly disposed, and as he is diseased in mind, so also in body, and his constantly increasing dissatisfaction becomes at last &#1511;&#1510;&#1507;, he grumbles at himself, at God, and all the world. From observing such persons, Paul says of them (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>.): "They have pierced themselves through (transfoderunt) with many sorrows."<p>In view of these great evils, with which the possession of riches also is connected: of their deceitful instability, and their merely belonging to this present life, Koheleth returns to his ceterum censeo. </body></html>
