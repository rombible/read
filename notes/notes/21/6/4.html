By one means or other his possessions come to strangers; this is vanity, and an evil disease. A numerous family was a matter of fond desire and of high honour among the Hebrews; and long life is the desire of mankind in general. Even with these additions a man may not be able to enjoy his riches, family, and life. Such a man, in his passage through life, seems to have been born for no end or use.

The Targum adds, "into this world." Some understand this of the abortive, and render it, "though he cometh in with vanity" (x), yet is to be preferred to the covetous man: others interpret it of the covetous man himself; and scrape of both: or, however, they may be compared together in these instances; the abortive comes into the world in vain, for nothing, and answers no purpose, as can well be observed; and the same may be said of a covetous rich man; he walks in a vain show, and is altogether vanity, in his coming in, in his life, and going out; <p>and departeth in darkness; or, "into darkness" (y); goes out of the world without any notice taken of him; and goes down to the dark grave, where he lies in obscurity; <p>and his name shall be covered with darkness; the abortive has no name, and is never spoken of; and so the name and memory of such a man as is here described rot and perish: and in this respect the abortive has the preference to him; for though he is covered with darkness, yet no ill is ever spoken of him; whereas the name of the wicked covetous man is cursed. <p>(x)  "quamvis venit", Drusius.

Probably, however, the words describe, in harmony with the thought of the preceding verse, the portion of the still-born child. <span class="bld">It</span> comes and goes, and is forgotten, and never sees the sun, and tastes not the misery of life. The last clause of <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-5.htm" title="Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this has more rest than the other.">Ecclesiastes 6:5</a>, <span class="bld">there is rest to this rather than to that</span> (“rest” idealised, as in <a href="/job/3-13.htm" title="For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,">Job 3:13</a>, as in itself all but the supreme good that man can strive after), seems to make this construction certain. Possibly, however, the description of <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-4.htm" title="For he comes in with vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.">Ecclesiastes 6:4</a> is made to apply in part to both terms of the comparison, so that it may be seen, on which side, both having so much in common, the balance of advantage lies. On “seeing the sun” as an equivalent for living, see chs. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm" title="Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm" title="Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>; <a href="/job/3-16.htm" title="Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-20.htm" title="Man that is in honor, and understands not, is like the beasts that perish.">Psalm 49:20</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he cometh in with vanity</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for it came into nothingness</span>.

Toward this seeing, i.e., knowing from his own experience, his effort went forth, according to <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a>; and what he here, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>, expresses as his resultat, he has already acknowledged at <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>. With "behold" he here returns to it; for he says, that from the observations just spoken of, as from others, no other resultat befell him. Instead of &#1512; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; (here and at <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>), he as often uses the words &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1</a>. In &#1512;&#1488;, the seeing is meant of that of mental apperception; in &#1500;&#1512;&#1488;, of immediate perception, experience. Our translation above does not correspond with the accentuation of the verse, which belongs to the class of disproportionably long verses without Athnach; cf. <a href="/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-13.htm">Jeremiah 13:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-37.htm">Jeremiah 51:37</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-10.htm">Ezekiel 42:10</a>; <a href="/amos/5-1.htm">Amos 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-26.htm">1 Chronicles 26:26</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>. The sentence &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; ... &#1492;&#1504;&#1492; (with pausal a&#772;ni with Reba) constitutes the beginning of the verse, in the form, as it were, of a superscription; and then its second part, the main proposition, is divided by the disjunctives following each other: Telisha Gedhola, Geresh, Legarmeh, Reba, Tebir, Tifcha, Silluk (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1</a>, where Pazer instead of Telisha Bedhola; but as for the rest, the sequence of the accents is the same). Among the moderns, Hengst. holds to the accents, for he translates in strict accordance therewith, as Tremmelius does: "Behold what I have seen: that it is fine and good (Trem. bonum pulchrum) to eat ... ." The asher in the phrase, tov asher-yapheh, then connects it together: good which is at the same time beautiful; Grtz sees here the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;. But the only passage to which, since Kimchi, reference is made for this use of asher, viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>, does not prove it; for we are not, with Drusius, to translate there by: iniquitas quae sit peccatum, but by quae poenam mereat. The accentuation here is not correct. The second asher is without doubt the resumption of the first; and the translation - as already Dachselt in his Biblia Accentuata indicated: ecce itaque quod vidi bonum, quod pulchrum (hoc est ut quis edat) - presents the true relation of the component parts of the sentence. The suffix of &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493; refers to the general subj. contained in the inf.; cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>. The period of time denoted by &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; is as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>. Also we read &#1495;&#1500; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>, in the same connection. </body></html>
