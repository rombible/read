It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools.

It is the very fire consuming them which produces the seeming merry noise (Joe 2:5). Their light soon goes out in the black darkness. There is a paronomasia in the Hebrew, Sirim ("thorns"), Sir ("pot"). The wicked are often compared to "thorns" (2Sa 23:6; Na 1:10). Dried cow-dung was the common fuel in Palestine; its slowness in burning makes the quickness of a fire of thorns the more graphic, as an image of the sudden end of fools (Ps 118:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The crackling of thorns, </span> which for a time make a great noise and blaze, but presently waste themselves, and go out without any considerable effect upon the meat in the pot. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So; </span> so vanishing and fruitless. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool,....

The image is drawn from the Eastern use of hay, stubble, and thorns for fuel (<a href="/matthew/6-30.htm" title="Why, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?">Matthew 6:30</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-12.htm" title="They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.">Psalm 118:12</a>).

So it would be with the mirth which was merely frivolous or foul.

No one can certainly show a man what shall be after him under the sun." We translate &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; only by "ja" ("certainly"), because in Germ. no interrogative can follow "dieweil" ("because"). The clause with asher (as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15</a>; cf. Song, under Sol 5:2), according to its meaning not different from ki, is related in the way of proof to that beginning with ki. Man is placed in our presence. To be able to say to him what is good for him, - i.e., what position he must take in life, what direction he must give to his activity, what decision he must adopt in difficult and important cases, - we ought not only to be able to penetrate his future, but, generally, the future; but, as Tropfen drops in the stream of history, we are poor Trpfe simpletons, who are hedged up within the present. Regarding the accus. of duration, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, pointing to the brevity of human life, vid., at <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a>. With &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;, the attribute of breath-like transitiveness is assigned to life (as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>) (as already in the name given to Abel, the second son of Adam), which is continued by &#1499;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1506; with the force of a relative clause, which is frequently the case after preceding part. attrib., e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>. We translate: which he spendeth like the (1) shadow [in the nom.] (after <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>; <a href="/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>); not: like a shadow [in the accus.]; for although the days of life are also likened to a shadow, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>, etc., yet this use of &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; does not accord therewith, which, without being a Graecism (Zirkel, Grtz), harmonises with the Greek phrase, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="/acts/15-33.htm">Acts 15:33</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>, lxx (also with the Lat. facere dies of Cicero, etc.). Thus also in the Syr. and Palest.-Aram. lacad is used of time, in the sense of transigere. Aharav does not mean: after his present condition (Zckl.); but, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a> : after he has passed away from this scene. Luzz. explains it correctly: Whether his children will remain in life? Whether the wealth he has wearied himself in acquiring will remain and be useful to them? But these are only illustrations. The author means to say, that a man can say, neither to himself nor to another, what in definite cases is the real advantage; because, in order to say this, he must be able to look far into the future beyond the limits of the individual life of man, which is only a small member of a great whole. </body></html>
