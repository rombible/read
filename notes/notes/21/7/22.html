It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Curse ... cursed - Rather, speak evil of ... spoken evil of. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

The word "oftentimes", in the first clause, is to be connected, not with the word "knoweth", as if a man often knew this, but with the word "cursed"; suggesting, that a man may be often guilty of this himself, and therefore should be more sparing of his censures of others; see <a href="/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">For oftentimes also thine own heart</span>] The rule of the previous verse is backed by an appeal to a man’s own conscience, “<span class="ital">mutato nomine de te fabula narratur</span>.” “Thou too art not free from the habit of censorious censure, of hard and bitter speeches; even, it may be, of ‘cursing,’ where blessing would have been better.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</span> The appeal to a man's own conscience follows. The fact that we often speak ill of others should make us less open to take offence at what is said of ourselves, and prepared to expect unfavorable comments. The Lord has said, "Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you" (<a href="/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1, 2</a>).

This seems to be a combination of two renderings of the passage. "<span class="accented">It</span> is the praise of perfect greatness to meet hostile treatment, without bravely and within mercifully some things are more quickly dismissed from our hearts if we know our own misdemeanors against our neighbors. For whilst we reflect what we have been towards others, we are the less concerned that others should have proved such persons towards ourselves, be cause the injustice of another avenges in us what our conscience justly accuses in itself" (St. Gregory, 'Moral.,' 22:26). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first of these counsels warns against extremes, on the side of good as well as on that of evil: "All have I seen in the days of my vanity: there are righteous men who perish by their righteousness, and there are wicked men who continue long by their wickedness. Be not righteous over-much, and show not thyself wise beyond measure: why wilt thou ruin thyself? Be not wicked overmuch, and be no fool: why wilt thou die before thy time is? It is good that thou holdest thyself to the one, and also from the other withdrawest not thine hand: for he that feareth God accomplisheth it all." One of the most original English interpreters of the Book of Koheleth, T. Tyler (1874), finds in the thoughts of the book - composed, according to his view, about 200 b.c. - and in their expression, references to the post-Aristotelian philosophy, particularly to the Stoic, variously interwoven with orientalism. But here, in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15-18</a>, we perceive, not so much the principle of the Stoical ethics - &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd; - as that of the Aristotelian, according to which virtue consists in the art &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, the art of holding the middle between extremes.<p>(Note: Cf. Luthardt's Lectures on the Moral Truths of Christianity, 2nd ed. Edin., T. and T. Clark.)<p>Also, we do not find here a reference to the contrasts between Pharisaism and Sadduceeism (Zckl.), viz., those already in growth in the time of the author; for if it should be also true, as Tyler conjectures, that the Sadducees had such a predilection for Epicurism, - as, according to Josephus (Vit. c. 2), "the doctrine of the Pharisees is of kin to that of the Stoics," - yet &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; are not apportioned between these two parties, especially since the overstraining of conformity to the law by the Pharisees related not to the moral, but to the ceremonial law. We derive nothing for the right understanding of the passage from referring the wisdom of life here recommended to the tendencies of the time. The author proceeds from observation, over against which the O.T. saints knew not how to place any satisfying theodicee. &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497; &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; (vid., <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>) he so designates the long, but for the most part uselessly spent life lying behind him. 'et-hakol is not "everything possible" (Zckl.), but "all, of all kinds" (Luth.), which is defined by 15b as of two kinds; for 15a is the introduction of the following experience relative to the righteous and the unrighteous, and thus to the two classes into which all men are divided. We do not translate: there are the righteous, who by their righteousness, etc. (Umbr., Hitzig, and others); for if the author should thus commence, it would appear as if he wished to give unrighteousness the preference to righteousness, which, however, was far from him. To perish in or by his righteousness, to live long in or by his wickedness (&#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, scil. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>, as at <a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>), is  equals  to die in spite of righteousness, to live in spite of wickedness, as e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a> : "in this thing"  equals  in spite of, etc. Righteousness has the promise of long life as its reward; but if this is the rule, it has yet its exceptions, and the author thence deduces the doctrine that one should not exaggerate righteousness; for if it occurs that a righteous man, in spite of his righteousness, perishes, this happens, at earliest, in the case in which, in the practice of righteousness, he goes beyond the right measure and limit. The relative conceptions &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; have here, since they are referred to the idea of the right measure, the meaning of nimis. &#1495;&#1514;&#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; could mean, "to play the wise man;" but that, whether more or less done, is objectionable. It means, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/1-10.htm">Exodus 1:10</a>, to act wisely (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/105-25.htm">Psalm 105:25</a>, &#1492;&#1514;, to act cunningly). And &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;, which is elsewhere used of being inwardly torpid, i.e., being astonished, obstupescere, has here the meaning of placing oneself in a benumbed, disordered state, or also, passively, of becoming disconcerted; not of becoming desolate or being deserted (Hitz., Ginsburg, and others), which it could only mean in highly poetic discourse (<a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>). The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; is syncop., like &#1514;&#1468;&#1498;&#1468;, <a href="/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27</a>; and the question, with &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, here and at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>, is of the same kind as <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>; Luther, weakening it: "that thou mayest not destroy thyself." </body></html>
