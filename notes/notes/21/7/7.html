This verse therefore cannot introduce a new subject, but must be connected with what has gone before. But it is so hard to do this satisfactorily, that Delitzsch conjectures that a line may have dropped out, and that this verse may have begun with “Better: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>“Better is a little with righteousness, &c,” as in <a href="/proverbs/16-8.htm" title="Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.">Proverbs 16:8</a>. If this be thought too strong a remedy, we may explain the connection, that by listening to faithful rebuke rather than to the flattery of fools, a ruler may be checked in a course of oppression or corruption which threatens to undermine his understanding. As we understand the passage, he becomes mad who commits, not who suffers, the oppression.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm" title="Surely oppression makes a wise man mad; and a gift destroys the heart.">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Oppression maketh a wise man mad — </span>Either, 1st, When a wise man falls into the sin of oppressing others, he is infatuated by it, and by the riches which he gains in this way: or, rather, 2d, When a man is oppressed by wicked men, it often makes him fret and vex himself, and speak or act unadvisedly and foolishly. <span class="ital">And a gift destroyeth the heart </span>— A bribe given to a wise man deprives him of the use of his understanding.

Be not long angry; though anger may come into the bosom of a wise man, it passes through it as a way-faring man; it dwells only in the bosom of fools. It is folly to cry out upon the badness of our times, when we have more reason to cry out for the badness of our own hearts; and even in these times we enjoy many mercies. It is folly to cry up the goodness of former times; as if former ages had not the like things to complain of that we have: this arises from discontent, and aptness to quarrel with God himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, oppression (or extortions) maketh a wise man foolish; and a bribe etc. If a wise man, being in a high position, exercises oppression (see <a href="/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a>), or practices extortion, he becomes a fool in so doing.

Its connection with Ec 7:4-6 is, the sight of "oppression" perpetrated by "fools" might tempt the "wise" to call in question God's dispensations, and imitate the folly (equivalent to "madness") described (Ec 7:5,6). Weiss, for "oppression," translates, "distraction," produced by merriment. But Ec 5:8 favors English Version.<p>a gift&#8212;that is, the sight of bribery in "places of judgment" (Ec 3:16) might cause the wise to lose their wisdom (equivalent to "heart"), (Job 12:6; 21:6, 7; 24:1, &c.).

When a wise man is oppressed by foolish and wicked men, it makes him fret and rage, and speak or act like a madman; for the wisest men are most sensible of indignities and injuries, whereas fools are stupid, and do not much lay them to heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A gift, </span> a bribe given to a wise man, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">destroyeth the heart; </span> deprives him of the use of his understanding, which is oft called the heart, as <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/23-8.htm" title="And you shall take no gift: for the gift blinds the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.">Exodus 23:8</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm" title="You shall not wrest judgment; you shall not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.">Deu 16:19</a> <a href="/hosea/4-8.htm" title="They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.">Hosea 4:8</a></span>, or makes him mad, as was said in the former clause. So this verse discovers two ways whereby a wise man may be made mad, by suffering oppression from others, or by receiving bribes to oppress others. And this also is an argument of the vanity of worldly wisdom, that it is so easily corrupted and lost, and so it serves the main design of this book. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad,.... Which is to be understood either passively, when he is oppressed by others, or sees others oppressed; it raises indignation in him, disturbs his mind, and he is ready to pass a wrong judgment on the dispensations of Providence, and to say rash and unadvised things concerning them, <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>; or actively, of oppression with which he oppresses others; when he gives into such measures, his wisdom departs from him, his mind is besotted, he acts the part of a madman, and pierces himself through with many sorrows.

One commentator (Delitzsch) cuts the knot by supposing the first half of the verse to have been lost, and supplies it conjecturally from Prov. 37:16 or <a href="/proverbs/16-8.htm" title="Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.">Proverbs 16:8</a>, “Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right,” after which the conjunction “for” comes in natural order. Taking the text as it stands we may yet trace a latent connexion.

The mirth of fools, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of the godless, is vanity, <span class="ital">for</span> it issues in oppression and in bribery. It is a question whether the “wise man” who is thus maddened by oppression is the oppressor or the oppressed. The balance seems to turn in favour of the former. The oppressive exercise of power is so demoralising that even the wise man, skilled in state-craft, loses his wisdom. There comes upon him, as the history of crime so often shews, something like a mania of tyrannous cruelty. And the same effect follows on the practice of corruption. It is true of the giver as well as the receiver of a bribe, that he loses his “heart,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> his power of moral discernment.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The verse begins with <span class="accented">ki</span>, which usually introduces a reason for what has preceded; but the difficulty in finding the connection has led to various explanations and evasions. The Authorized Version boldly separates the verse from what has gone before, and makes a new paragraph beginning with "surely:" <span class="cmt_word">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad.</span> Delitzsch supposes that something has been lost between vers. 6 and 7, and he supplies the gap by a clause borrowed from <a href="/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>, "Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right;" and then the sentence proceeds naturally, "For oppression," etc. But this is scarcely satisfactory, as it is mere conjecture wholly unsupported by external evidence. The Vulgate leaves <span class="accented">ki</span> untranslated; the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. Looking at the various paragraphs, all beginning with <span class="accented">rob</span>, rendered "better," viz. vers. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, we must regard the present verse as connected with what precedes, a new subject being introduced at ver. 8. Putting ver. 6 in a parenthesis as merely presenting an illustration of the talk of fools, we may see in ver. 7 a confirmation of the first part of ver. 5. The rebuke of the wise is useful even in the case of rulers who are tempted -to excess and injustice. The "oppression" in the text is the exercise of irresponsible power, that which a man inflicts, not what he suffers; this makes him "mad," even though he be in other respects and under other circumstances wise; he ceases to be directed by reason and principle, and needs the correction of faithful rebuke. The Septuagint and Vulgate, rendering respectively <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="accented">calumnia</span>, imply that the evil which distracts the wise man is false accusation. <span class="cmt_word">And a gift destroyeth the heart.</span> The admission of bribery is likewise an evil that calls for wise rebuke. So <a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>, "He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live." The phrase, "destroys the heart," means corrupts the understanding, <span class="accented">deprives</span> a man of wisdom, makes him no better than a fool (comp. <a href="/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>, where the same effect is attributed to whoredom and drunkenness). The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "destroys the heart of his nobility;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">perdet robur cordis illius</span>, "will destroy the strength of his heart." The interpretation given above seems to be the most reasonable way of dealing with the existing text; but Nowack and Volck adopt Delitzsch's emendation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Better is a name than precious ointment; and better is the day of death than the day when one is born." Like &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;, so &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; stand to each other in the relation of a paronomasia (vid., Song under Sol 1:3). Luther translates: "Ein gut Gercht ist besser denn gute Salbe" "a good odour ( equals  reputation) is better than good ointment. If we substitute the expression denn Wolgeruch than sweet scent, that would be the best possible rendering of the paronomasia. In the arrangement &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; ... &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, tov would be adj. to shem (a good reputation goes beyond sweet scent); but tov standing first in the sentence is pred., and shem thus in itself alone, as in the cogn. prov., <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>, signifies a good, well-sounding, honourable, if not venerable name; cf. anshe&#772; hashshem, <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>; veli-shem, nameless, <a href="/job/30-8.htm">Job 30:8</a>. The author gives the dark reverse to this bright side of the distich: the day of death better than the day in which one (a man), or he (the man), is born; cf. for this reference of the pronoun, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>. It is the same lamentation as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>., which sounds less strange from the mouth of a Greek than from that of an Israelite; a Thracian tribe, the Trausi, actually celebrated their birthdays as days of sadness, and the day of death as a day of rejoicing (vid., Bhr's Germ. translat. of Herodotus, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>). - Among the people of the Old Covenant this was not possible; also a saying such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a> is not in the spirit of the O.T. revelation of religion; yet it is significant that it was possible <p>(Note: "The reflections of the Preacher," says Hitzig (Sd. deut. ev. protest.
