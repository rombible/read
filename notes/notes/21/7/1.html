It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools.

The word "good" is not in the text, but is rightly supplied, as it is by Jarchi; for of no other name can this be said; that which is not good cannot be better. Some understand this of the name of God, which is God himself, who is the "summum bonum", and chief happiness of men, and take it to be an answer to the question <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; this and this only is what is a man's good, and is preferable to all outward enjoyments whatever; interest in him as a covenant God; knowledge of him in Christ, which has eternal life annexed to it; communion with him; the discoveries of his lovingkindness, which is better than little; and the enjoyment of him to all eternity. This is true of the name of Christ, whose name Messiah which signifies anointed, is as ointment poured forth, and is preferable to it, Sol 1:3; so his other names, Jesus a Saviour; Jehovah, our righteousness; Immanuel, God with us; are exceeding precious to those who know the worth of him, and see their need of righteousness and salvation by him; his person, and the knowledge of him; his Gospel, and the fame and report it gives of him; infinitely exceed the most precious and fragrant ointment; see <a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>. So the name or names given to the people of God, the new names of Hephzibah and Beulah, the name of sons of God, better than that of sons and daughters; and of Christians, or anointed ones, having received that anointing from Christ which teacheth all things, and so preferable to the choicest ointment, <a href="/isaiah/56-5.htm">Isaiah 56:5</a>. Likewise to have a name written in heaven, in the Lamb's book of life, and to have one's name confessed by Christ hereafter before his Father and his holy angels; or even a good name among men, a name for a truly godly gracious person; for love to Christ, zeal for his cause, and faithfulness to his truths and ordinances; such as the woman got, better than the box of ointment poured on Christ's head; and which the brother had, whose praise in the Gospel was throughout the churches; and as Demetrius, who had good report of all then, and of the truth itself, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-13.htm">Matthew 26:13</a>, <a href="/3_john/1-12.htm">3 John 1:12</a>. Such a good name is better than precious ointment for the value of it, being better than all riches, for which this may be put; see <a href="/isaiah/39-2.htm">Isaiah 39:2</a>; and for the fragrancy of it, emitting a greater; and for the continuance of it, being more lasting, <a href="/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a>. The Targum is, <p>"better is a good name the righteous get in this world, thin the anointing oil which was poured upon the heads of kings and priests.'' <p>So Alshech, <p>"a good name is better than the greatness of a king, though anointed with oil;'' <p>and the day of death than the day of one's birth; some render it, in connection with the preceding clause, "as a good name is better, &amp;c. so the day of death than the day of one's birth" (f); that is, the day of a man's death than the day of his birth. This is to be understood not of death simply considered; for that in itself, abstracted from its connections and consequences, is not better than to be born into the world, or come into life, or than life itself; it is not preferable to it, nor desirable; for it is contrary to nature, being a dissolution of it; a real evil, as life, and long life, are blessings; an enemy to mankind, and a terrible one: nor of ether persons, with whom men have a connection, their friends and relations; for with them the day of birth is a time of rejoicing, and the day of death is a time of mourning, as appears from Scripture and all experience; see <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>. It is indeed reported (g) of some Heathenish and barbarous people in Thrace, and who inhabited Mount Caucasus, that they mourned at the birth of their children, reckoning up the calamities they are entering into, and rejoiced at the death of their friends, being delivered from their troubles: but this is to be understood of the persons themselves that are born and die; not of all mankind, unless as abstracted from the consideration of a future state, and so it is more happy to be freed from trouble than to enter into it; nor of wicked men, it would have been better indeed if they had never been born, or had died as soon as born, that their damnation might not have been aggravated by the multitude of their sins; but after all, to die cannot be best for them, since at death they are cast into hell, into everlasting fire, and endless punishment: this is only true of good men, that have a good name living and dying; have a good work of grace upon them, and so are meet for heaven; the righteousness of Christ on them, and so have a title to it; they are such who have hope in their death, and die in faith and in the Lord: their death is better than their birth; at their birth they come into the world under the imputation and guilt of sin, with a corrupt nature; are defiled with sin, and under the power of it, liable in themselves to condemnation and death for it: at the time of their death they go out justified from sin through the righteousness of Christ, all being expiated by his sacrifice, and pardoned for his sake; they are washed from the faith of sin by the blood of Christ, and are delivered from the power and being of it by the Spirit and grace of God; and are secured from condemnation and the second death: at their coming into the world they are liable to sin yet more and more; at their going out they are wholly freed from it; at the time of their birth they are born to trouble, and are all their days exercised with it, incident to various diseases of the body, have many troubles in the world, and from the men of it; many conflicts with a body of sin and death, and harassed with the temptations of Satan; but at death they are delivered from all these, enter into perfect peace and unspeakable joy; rest from all their labours and toils, and enjoy uninterrupted communion with God, Father, Son, and Spirit, angels, and glorified saints. The Targum is, <p>"the day in which a man dies and departs to the house of the grave, with a good name and with righteousness, is better than the day in which a wicked man is born into the world.'' <p>So the Midrash interprets it of one that goes out of the world with a good name, considering this clause in connection with the preceding, as many do. <p>(f) So Schmidt, and some in Vatablus.

He has learnt to take a relative estimate of what men count good or evil, truer than that which commonly prevails among them. It lies almost in the nature of the case, that these moralizings should take a somewhat discontinuous form, like that, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> of the <span class="ital">Pensées</span> of Pascal or the <span class="ital">Meditations</span> of Marcus Aurelius, the entries, let us say, which the thinker entered, day by day, in his tablets or on his <span class="ital">codex</span>. They are marked, however, by a sufficient unity of tone. The same pensive cast of thought is found in all, and it raises the thinker out of a mere self-seeking, self-indulgent Epicureanism into a wider and nobler sympathy. He rises as on the “stepping-stones” of his “dead self” to higher things. Nor are the maxims indeed without a certain unity of form, and the three words “it is better” in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm" title="A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm" title="It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm" title="Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a> serve as a connecting link. The words and the maxims that follow in <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm" title="It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart....">Ecclesiastes 7:2-5</a> have naturally been a stumblingblock to those who saw in Koheleth nothing but the advocate of a sensual voluptuousness, and with the desperate courage of men maintaining a theory, they argue (I take Grätz as the representative of a school) that these are not the thoughts of the <span class="bld">Debater</span> himself, but of some imaginary opponent of the ascetic Essene type, against whom he afterwards enters his protest. The view is, it is believed, just as untenable as that of the interpreters of the opposite school, who see in the oft-repeated precepts counselling moderate enjoyment nothing but the utterances of an ideal Epicurean, set up for the purpose of being knocked down.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the maxim which opens the series there is an alliterative emphasis, which is fairly represented by the German translation (Knobel) “<span class="ital">Besser gut Gerücht als güte Gerüche</span>. The good name (<span class="ital">shem</span>) is better than good ointment (<span class="ital">shemen</span>), echoing in this respect the words of Song <a href="/songs/1-3.htm" title="Because of the smell of your good ointments your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love you.">Song of Solomon 1:3</a>, “A good name is better than good nard,” is perhaps the nearest English approximation in this respect. The maxim itself indicates a craving for something higher than the perfumed oil, which was the crowning luxury of Eastern life (<a href="/psalms/45-8.htm" title="All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="/amos/6-6.htm" title="That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.">Amos 6:6</a>; <a href="/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-7.htm" title="There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.">Matthew 26:7</a>), even the praise and admiration of our fellow-men. To live in their memories, our name as a sweet odour that fills the house, is better than the most refined enjoyment. The student of the Gospel history will recall the contrast between the rich man who fared sumptuously every day (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm" title="There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:">Luke 16:19</a>), whose very name is forgotten, and who is remembered only as a type of evil, and the woman whose lavish gift of the ointment of spikenard is told through the whole world as a memorial of her (<a href="/mark/14-9.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.">Mark 14:9</a>), and who is identified by John, <a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>, with Mary of Bethany.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the day of death than the day of one’s birth</span>] The two parts of the thought hang closely together. If the “good name” has been earned in life, death removes the chance of failure and of shame. In the language of Solon (Herod. i. 32) only he who crowns a prosperous life by a peaceful death can be called truly happy. The thought presents, however, a strange contrast to the craving for life which was so strong an element, as in Hezekiah’s elegy (<a href="/context/isaiah/38-9.htm" title="The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:...">Isaiah 38:9-20</a>), of Hebrew feeling, and is, like similar thoughts in ch. <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm" title="If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he....">Ecclesiastes 6:3-4</a>, essentially ethnic in its character. So Herodotus (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-4.htm" title="The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.">Ecclesiastes 7:4</a>) relates that the Trausi, a Thracian tribe, met on the birth of a child and bewailed the woes and sorrows which were its inevitable portion, while they buried their dead with joy and gladness, as believing that they were set free from evils and had entered on happiness, or at least on the unbroken rest of the eternal sleep. So Euripides, apparently with reference to this practice, of which he may well have heard at the court of Archelaus, writes in his <span class="ital">Cresphontes</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐδεῖ γὰρ ἡμᾶς σύλλογον ποιουμένους</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν φύντα θρηνεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὅσ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἔρχεται κακά</span>•<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">αὖ θανόντα καὶ πόνων πεπαυμένον</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χαίροντας εὐφημοῦντας ἐκπέμπειν δόμων</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“It were well done, comparing things aright,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To wail the new-born child for all the ills<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On which he enters; and for him who dies<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so has rest from labour, to rejoice<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And with glad words to bear him from his home.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Strabo, who quotes the lines (xi. c. 12, p. 144), attributes the practice to Asiatic nations, possibly to those who had come under the influence of that Buddhist teaching as to the vanity and misery of life of which even the partial pessimism of Koheleth may be as a far-off echo.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>. - Division II.

Though no man knows for certain what is best, yet there are <span class="accented">some practical rules for the conduct of life which wisdom gives</span>. Some of these Koheleth sets forward in the proverbial form, recommending a serious, earnest life in preference to one of gaiety and frivolity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A good name is better than precious ointment.</span> The paronomasia here is to be remarked, <span class="accented">rob ahem mishemen tob</span>. There is a similar assonance in <a href="/songs/1-3.htm">Song of Solomon 1:3</a>, which the German translator reproduces by the sentence, "Besser gut Gerucht als Wohlgeruch," or," gute Geruche," and which may perhaps be rendered in English, "Better is good favor than good flavor." It is a proverbial saying, running literally, <span class="accented">Better is a name than good oil</span>. <span class="accented">Shem</span>, "name," is sometimes used unqualified to signify a celebrated name, good name, reputation (comp. <a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Melius eat nomen bonum quam unguenta pre-tiosa</span>. Odorous unguents were very precious in the mind of an Oriental, and formed one of the luxuries lavished at feasts and costly entertainments, or social visits (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <a href="/ruth/3-3.htm">Ruth 3:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>; Wisd. 2:7; <a href="/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37, 46</a>). It was a man's most cherished ambition to leave a good reputation, and to hand down an honorable remembrance to distant posterity, and this all the more as the hope of the life beyond the grave was dim and vague (see on Ecclesiastes 2:16, and comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>). The complaint of the sensualists in Wisd. 2:4 is embittered by the thought," Our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance." We employ a metaphor like that in the clause when we speak of a man's reputation having a good or ill odor; and the Hebrews said of ill fame that it stank in the nostrils (<a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>; see, on the opposite side, Ecclus. 24:15; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the day of death than the day of one's birth.</span> The thought in this clause is closely connected with the preceding. If a man's life is such that he leaves a good name behind him, then the day of his departure is better than that of his birth, because in the latter he had nothing before him but labor, and trouble, and fear, and uncertainty; and in the former all these anxieties are past, the storms are successfully battled with, the haven is won (see on Ecclesiastes 4:3). According to Solon's well-known maxim, no one can be called happy till he has crowned a prosperous life by a peaceful death (Herod., 1:32; Soph., 'Trachin.,' 1-3; ('Ed. Tyr.,' 1528, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.); as the Greek gnome runs - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Call no man great till thou hast seen him dead."</span> So Ben-Sira, "Judge none blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) before his death; for a man shall be known in his children" (Ecclus. 11:28). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet his soul has never enough;" or, properly, it is not filled, so that it desires nothing further and nothing more; &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488; used as appropriately of the soul as of the ear, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>; for that the mouth and the soul are here placed opposite to one another as "organs of the purely sensual and therefore transitory enjoyment, and of the deeper and more spiritual and therefore more lasting kind of joys" (Zck.), is an assertion which brings out of the text what it wishes to be in it, - &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; stand here so little in contrast, that, as at <a href="/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>, instead of the soul the stomach could also be named; for it is the soul longing, and that after the means from without of self-preservation, that is here meant; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, "beautiful soul," Chullin iv. 7, is an appetite which is not fastidious, but is contented. &#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/129-2.htm">Psalm 129:2</a>. All labour, the author means to say, is in the service of the impulse after self-preservation; and yet, although it concentrates all its efforts after this end, it does not bring full satisfaction to the longing soul. This is grounded in the fact that, however in other respects most unlike, men are the same in their unsatisfied longing. </body></html>
