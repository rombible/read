Surely it is better to be patient in spirit, than to be proud and hasty. Be not soon angry, nor quick in resenting an affront. Be not long angry; though anger may come into the bosom of a wise man, it passes through it as a way-faring man; it dwells only in the bosom of fools. It is folly to cry out upon the badness of our times, when we have more reason to cry out for the badness of our own hearts; and even in these times we enjoy many mercies. It is folly to cry up the goodness of former times; as if former ages had not the like things to complain of that we have: this arises from discontent, and aptness to quarrel with God himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better - Inasmuch as something certain is attained, man contemplates the end throughout an entire course of action, and does not rest upon the beginning.<p>Patient ... proud - literally, "Long," long-suffering ..."high," in the sense of impatient. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. angry&#8212;impatient at adversity befalling thee, as Job was (Ec 5:2; Pr 12:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Be not angry with any man without due consideration, and just and necessary cause; for otherwise anger is sometimes lawful, and sometimes a duty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Resteth; </span> hath its settled and quiet abode, is their constant companion, ever at hand upon all occasions, whereas wise men resist, and mortify, and banish it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the bosom; </span> in the heart, the proper seat of the passions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry,....

Anger, alike from the Stoic and Epicurean stand-point (and the writer, as we have seen, had points of contact with each of them), was the note of unwisdom. If it be right at all, it is when it is calm and deliberate, an indignation against moral evil. The hasty anger of wounded self-love is, as in the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>), destructive of the tranquillity of true wisdom, and, transient and impulsive as it seems at first, may harden “in the bosom of the fool” into a settled antipathy or malignant scorn.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry.</span> A further warning against the arrogance which murmurs at Providence and revolts against the checks of the Divine arrangement. The injunction in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a> might be taken in this sense. It is not a general admonition against unrighteous anger, but is leveled at the haughty indignation which a proud man feels when things do not go as he wishes, and he deems that he could have managed matters more satisfactorily. <span class="cmt_word">For anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</span> Such unreasonable displeasure is the mark of a foolish or skeptical mind, and if it rests (<a href="/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>), is fostered and cherished there, may develop into misanthropy and atheism. If we adopt the rendering" word" in ver. 8, we may see in this injunction a warning against being quick to take offence at a rebuke, as it is only the fool who will not look to the object of the censure and see that it ought to be patiently submitted to. On the subject of anger St. Gregory writes, "As often as we restrain the turbulent motions of the mind under the virtue of mildness, we are essaying to return to the likeness of our Creator. For when the peace of mind is lashed with anger, torn and rent, as it were, it is thrown into confusion, so that it is not in harmony with itself, and loses the force of the inward likeness. By anger wisdom is parted with, so that we are left wholly in ignorance what to do; as it is written, 'Anger resteth in the bosom of a fool,' in this way, that it withdraws the light of understanding, while by agitating it troubles the mind" ('Moral.,' 5:78). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The joy of life must thus be not riot and tumult, but a joy tempered with seriousness: "Better is sorrow than laughter: for with a sad countenance it is well with the heart. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, and the heart of fools in the house of mirth." Grief and sorrow, &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1505;, whether for ourselves or occasioned by others, is better, viz., morally better, than extravagant merriment; the heart is with &#1512;&#1506; &#1508;&#1468; (inf. as &#1512;&#1506;, <a href="/jeremiah/7-6.htm">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; cf. &#1508;&#1503; &#1512;, <a href="/genesis/40-7.htm">Genesis 40:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a>), a sorrowful countenance, better than with laughter, which only masks the feeling of disquiet peculiar to man, <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>. Elsewhere &#1500;&#1489; &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489;  equals  "the heart is (may be) of good cheer," e.g., <a href="/ruth/3-7.htm">Ruth 3:7</a>; <a href="/judges/19-6.htm">Judges 19:6</a>; here also joyful experience is meant, but well becoming man as a religious moral being. With a sad countenance it may be far better as regards the heart than with a merry countenance in boisterous company. Luther, in the main correct, after Jerome, who on his part follows Symmachus: "The heart is made better by sorrow." The well-being is here meant as the reflex of a moral: bene se habere.<p>Sorrow penetrates the heart, draws the thought upwards, purifies, transforms. Therefore is the heart of the wise in the house of sorrow; and, on the other hand, the heart of fools is in the house of joy, i.e., the impulse of their heart goes thither, there they feel themselves at home; a house of joy is one where there are continual feasts, or where there is at the time a revelling in joy. That <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:4</a> is divided not by Athnach, but by Zakef, has its reason in this, that of the words following &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;, none consists of three syllables; cf. on the contrary, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>, &#1495;&#1499;&#1501;. From this point forward the internal relation of the contents is broken up, according to which this series of sayings as a concluding section hangs together with that containing the observations going before in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1-12</a>. </body></html>
