Or, "far off is that which has been" (g). That which has been done by God already, in creation and providence, is out of the reach of men, is far from their understandings wholly to comprehend or account for; and likewise that which is past with men, what has been done in former ages, the history of past times, is very difficult to come at: or rather, according to Schmidt, and Rambachius after him, what was of old is now afar off or absent; the image of God in man which consisted of perfect wisdom, and was created at the same time with him, is now lost, and that is the reason why wisdom is far from him; <p>and exceeding deep, who can find it out? the primitive perfect wisdom is sunk so deep and gone, that no man can find it to the perfection it was once enjoyed; see <a href="/job/28-12.htm">Job 28:12</a>. This may respect the knowledge of God, and the perfections of his nature; which are as high as heaven, and deeper than hell, <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>; and of his thoughts, counsels, purposes, and decrees, which are the deep things of God; as well as the doctrines of the Gospel, and the mysteries of grace, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>; and even his providential dispensations towards the sons of men, <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>. The Targum of the whole is, <p>"Lo, now it is far off from the children of men to know all that has been from the days of old; and the secret of the day of death, and the secret of the day in which the King Messiah shall come, who is he that shall find it out by his wisdom?'' <p>(g)   "remotum (est) illud quod fuit", Montanus, Mercerus, Vatablus, Drusius, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That which is far off, <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?</span><p>(r) Meaning wisdom.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">That which is far off and exceeding deep</span>] The English of the latter clause scarcely expresses the Hebrew more emphatic iteration <span class="bld">and deep deep.</span> By some interpreters a like iteration is supplied in the first clause, <span class="bld">far off is that which is far</span>, but there does not seem adequate ground for thus altering the text.

Professor Lewis renders, "Far off! the past, what is it? Deep - a deep - oh, who can find?" and explains "the past" to mean, not merely the earthly past historically unknown, but the great past before the creation of the universe, the kingdom of all eternities with its ages of ages, its worlds of worlds, its mighty evolutions, its infinite variety. We prefer to retain the rendering, "that which is," and to refer the expression to the phenomenal world. It is not the essence of wisdom that is spoken of, but the facts of man's life and the circumstances in which he finds himself, the course of the world, the phenomena of nature, etc. These things  - their causes, connection, interdependence  - we cannot explain satisfactorily (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>). In the Book of Wisdom (7:17-21) Solomon is supposed to have arrived at this abstruse knowledge, "for," he says, "God hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;</span>)," and he proceeds to enumerate the various departments which this "universitas literarum" has opened to him. The Septuagint (and virtually the Vulgate) connects this verse with the preceding, thus: . 'I said, I will be wise, and it (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) was far from me, far beyond what was (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>), and deep depth: who shall find it out?" (For the epithet "deep" applied to what is recondite or what is beyond human comprehension, comp. <a href="/proverbs/20-5.htm">Proverbs 20:5</a>; <a href="/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"It is good that thou holdest fast to the one," - viz. righteousness and wisdom, - and withdrawest not thy hand from the other, - viz. a wickedness which renounces over-righteousness and over-wisdom, or an unrestrained life; - for he who fears God accomplishes all, i.e., both, the one as well as the other. Luther, against the Vulg.: "for he who fears God escapes all." But what "all"? Tyler, Bullock, and others reply: "All the perplexities of life;" but no such thing is found in the text here, however many perplexities may be in the book. Better, Zckler: the evil results of the extreme of false righteousness as of bold wickedness. But that he does not destroy himself and does not die before his time, is yet only essentially one thing which he escapes; also, from <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>, only one thing, &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, is taken. Thus either: the extremes (Umbr.), or: the extremes together with their consequences. The thought presents a connected, worthy conclusion. But if e&#780;th-kullam, with its retrospective suffix, can be referred to that which immediately precedes, this ought to have the preference. Ginsburg, with Hitzig: "Whoso feareth God will make his way with both;" but what an improbable phrase! Jerome, with his vague nihil negligit, is right as to the meaning. In the Bible, the phrase &#1492; ... &#1497;&#1495;&#1488;, egressus est urbem, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/44-4.htm">Genesis 44:4</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>, is used; and in the Mishna, &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1495;&#1493;&#1489;&#1514;&#1493;, i.e., he has discharged his duty, he is quit of it by fulfilling it. For the most part, &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; merely is used: he has satisfied his duty; and &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488;, he has not satisfied it, e.g., Berachoth 2:1. Accordingly &#1497;&#1495;&#1488; - since e&#780;th-kullam relates to, "these ought he to have done, and not to leave the other undone," <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a> - here means: he who fears God will set himself free from all, will acquit himself of the one as well as of the other, will perform both, and thus preserve the golden via media. </body></html>
