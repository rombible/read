It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Good and prosperous days are in God's design special times of comfort and rejoicing: the days of affliction and trouble, are in God's design the proper seasons of recollection and serious consideration.

Or, "in a good day" (q). When things go well in the commonwealth, in a man's family, and with himself, health, peace, and plenty, are enjoyed, a man's circumstances are thriving and flourishing; it becomes him to be thankful to God, freely and cheerfully to enjoy what is bestowed on him, and do good with it: or, "be in good" (r); in good heart, in good spirits, cheerful and lively; or, "enjoy good", as the Vulgate Latin version; for what God gives to men is given them richly to enjoy, to make use of themselves, and be beneficial unto others; so the Targum, <p>"in the day the Lord does well to thee be thou also in goodness, and do good to all the world;'' <p>see <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>; Jarchi's paraphrase is, <p>"when it is in thine hand to do good, be among those that do good;'' <p>but in the day of adversity consider; or, "in the day of evil" (s); consider from whence affliction comes; not out of the dust, nor by chance, but from God, and by his wise appointment; and for what it comes, that sin is the cause of it, and what that is; and also for what ends it is sent, to bring to a sense of sin, and confession of it, and humiliation for it; to take it away, and make good men more partakers of holiness: or, "look for the day of adversity" (t); even in the day of prosperity it should be expected; for there is no firmness and stability in any state; there are continual vicissitudes and changes. The Targum is, <p>"that the evil day may not come upon thee, see and behold;'' <p>be careful and circumspect, and behave in a wise manner, that so it may be prevented. Jarchi's note is, <p>"when evil comes upon the wicked, be among those that see, and not among those that are seen;'' <p>and compares it with <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>; It may be observed, that there is a set time for each of these, prosperity and adversity; and that the time is short, and therefore called a day; and the one is good, and the other is evil; which characters they have according to the outward appearance, and according to the judgment and esteem of men; otherwise, prosperity is oftentimes hurtful, and destroys fools, and adversity is useful to the souls of good men; <p>God also hath set the one over against the other; they are both by his appointment, and are set in their proper place, and come in their proper time; succeed each other, and answer to one another, as day and night, summer and winter, and work, together for the good of men; <p>to the end that man should find nothing after him; should not be able to know what will be hereafter; what his case and circumstances will be, whether prosperous or adverse; since things are so uncertain, and so subject to change, and nothing permanent; and therefore can find nothing to trust in and depend upon, nothing that he can be sure of: and things are so wisely managed and disposed, that a man can find no fault with them, nor just reason to complain of them; so the Vulgate Latin version, "not find just complaints against him"; and to the same purpose the Syriac version, "that he may complain of him"; the Targum is, <p>"not find any evil in this world.'' <p>(q)  "in die bono", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Gejerus.

The advice is the same as that which runs through the book, viz. to make the best of the present. So Ben-Sire says, "Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not a share in a good desire pass thee by" (Ecclus. 14:14). Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;</span>, "In a day of good live in (an atmosphere of) good;" Vulgate, in <span class="accented">die bona fruere bonis</span>, "In a good day enjoy your good things." <span class="cmt_word">But in the day of adversity consider</span>; <span class="accented">in the evil day look well</span>. The writer could not conclude this clause so as to make it parallel with the other, or he would have had to say, "In the ill day take it ill," which would be far from his meaning; so he introduces a thought which may help to make one resigned to adversity. The reflection follows. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et malam diem praecave</span>, "Beware of the evil day." But, doubtless, the object of the verb is the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">God also hath set the one over against the other</span>; or, <span class="accented">God hath made the one corresponding to the other</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he hath made the day of evil as well as the day of good. The light and shade in man's life are equally under God's ordering and permission. "What?" cries Job (<a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>), "shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" Corn. Lapide quotes a saying of Plutarch to this effect: the harp gives forth sounds acute and grave, and both combine to form the melody; so in man's life the mingling of prosperity and adversity yields a well-adjusted harmony. God strikes all the strings of our life's harp, and we ought, not only patiently, but cheerfully, to listen to the chords produced by this Divine Performer. <span class="cmt_word">To the end that man should find nothing after him.</span> This clause gives Koheleth's view of God's object in the admixture of good and evil; but the reason has been variously interpreted, the explanation depending on the sense assigned to the term "after him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>). The Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which is vague; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">contra eum</span>, meaning that man may have no occasion to complain against God. Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') considers that Koheleth here implies that death closes the scene, and that there is then nothing more to fear, rendering the clause, "On the ground that man is to experience nothing at all hereafter." They who believe that the writer held the doctrine of a future life cannot acquiesce in this view. The interpretation of Delitzsch is this - God lets man pass through the whole discipline of good and evil, that when lie dies there may be nothing which he has not experienced. Hitzig and Nowack explain the text to mean that, as God designs that man after his death shall have done with all things, he sends upon him evil as well as good, that he may not have to punish him hereafter - a doctrine opposed to the teaching of a future judgment. Wright deems the idea to be that man may be kept in ignorance of what shall happen to him beyond the grave, that the present life may afford no clue to the future. One does not see why this should be a comfort, nor how it is compatible with God's known counsel of making the condition of the future life dependent upon the conduct of this. Other explanations being more or less unsatisfactory, many modern commentators see in the passage an assertion that God intermingle8 good and evil in men's lives according to laws with which they are unacquainted, in order that they may not disquiet themselves by forecasting the future, whether in this life or after their death, but may be wholly dependent upon God, casting all their care upon him, knowing that he careth for them (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>). We may safely adopt this explanation (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>).

So look upon all the works of the Mast High: there are two and two, one against the ether." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a fourth, or, taking into account the mutilated one, a fifth proverb of that which is better: "Better the end of a thing than its beginning; better one who forbears than one who is haughty. Hasten thyself not in thy spirit to become angry: for anger lieth down in the bosom of fools." The clause 8a is first thus to be objectively understood as it stands. It is not without limitation true; for of a matter in itself evil, the very contrary is true, <a href="/proverbs/5-4.htm">Proverbs 5:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-32.htm">Proverbs 23:32</a>. But if a thing is not in itself evil, the end of its progress, the reaching to its goal, the completion of its destination, is always better than its beginning, which leaves it uncertain whether it will lead to a prosperous issue. An example of this is Solon's saying to Croesus, that only he is to be pronounced happy whose good fortune it is to end his life well in the possession of his wealth (Herod. i.32).<p>The proverb Ecc 7:8 will stand in some kind of connection with 8a, since what it says is further continued in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>. In itself, the frequently long and tedious development between the beginning and the end of a thing requires expectant patience. But if it is in the interest of a man to see the matter brought to an issue, an &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1507;&#1468; will, notwithstanding, wait with self-control in all quietness for the end; while it lies in the nature of the &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, the haughty, to fret at the delay, and to seek to reach the end by violent means; for the haughty man thinks that everything must at once be subservient to his wish, and he measures what others should do by his own measureless self-complacency. We may with Hitzig translate: "Better is patience (&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;  equals  &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;) than haughtiness" (&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, inf., as &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1500;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-19.htm">Proverbs 16:19</a>). But there exists no reason for this; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; is not to be held, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-5.htm">Proverbs 16:5</a>, and elsewhere generally, as the connecting form of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, and so &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; for that of &#1488;&#1512;&#1498;; it amounts to the same thing whether the two properties (characters) or the persons possessing them are compared. </body></html>
