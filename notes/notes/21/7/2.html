It will do more good to go to a funeral than to a feast. We may lawfully go to both, as there is occasion; our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana, and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany. But, considering how apt we are to be vain and indulge the flesh, it is best to go to the house of mourning, to learn the end of man as to this world. Seriousness is better than mirth and jollity. That is best for us which is best for our souls, though it be unpleasing to sense. It is better to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise, than to have them gratified by the song of fools.

For deceased relations or friends, who either lie unburied, or have been lately inferred; for the Jews kept their mourning for their dead several days afterwards, when their friends visited them in order to comfort them, as the Jews did Martha and Mary, <a href="/john/11-31.htm">John 11:31</a>. So the Targum here, <p>"it is better to go to a mourning man to comfort him;'' <p>for at such times and places the conversation was serious and interesting, and turned upon the subjects of mortality and a future state, and preparation for it; from whence useful and instructive lessons are learned; and so it was much better to be there <p>than to go to the house of feasting: the Targum is, <p>"than to the house of a feast of wine of scorners;'' <p>where there is nothing but noise and clamour, luxury and intemperance, carnal mirth and gaiety, vain and frothy conversation, idle talk and impure songs, and a jest made of true religion and godliness, death and another world; <p>for that is the end of all men; not the house of feasting, but the house of mourning; or mourning itself, as Jarchi; every man must expect to lose his relation and friend, and so come to the house of mourning; and must die himself, and be the occasion of mourning: death itself seems rather intended, which is the end of all men, the way of all flesh; for it is appointed for men to die; and so the Targum, <p>"seeing upon them all is decreed the decree of death;'' <p>and the living will lay it to his heart; by going to the house of mourning, he will be put in mind of death, and will think of it seriously, and consider his latter end, how near it is; and that this must be his case shortly, as is the deceased's he comes to mourn for. So the Targum interprets it of words concerning death, or discourses of mortality he there hears, which he takes notice of and lays to his heart, and lays up in it.

In recommending the sober, earnest life, Koheleth teaches that wiser, more enduring lessons are to be learned where grief reigns than in the empty and momentary excitement of mirth and joyousness. The house in question is mourning for a death; and what a long and harrowing business this was is well known (see <a href="/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a>; Ecclus. 22:10; <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>, etc.). Visits of condolence and periodical pilgrimages to groves of departed relatives were considered duties (<a href="/john/11-19.htm">John 11:19, 31</a>), and conduced to the growth in the mind of sympathy, seriousness, and the need of preparation for death. The opposite side, the house of carousal, where all that is serious is put away, leading to such scenes as Isaiah denounces (<a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>), offers no wise teaching, and produces only selfishness, heartlessness, thoughtlessness. What is said here is no contradiction to what was said in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, that there was nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and enjoy himself. For Koheleth was not speaking of unrestrained sensualism - the surrender of the mind to the pleasures of the body - but of the moderate enjoyment of the good things of life conditioned by the fear of God and love of one's neighbor. This statement is quite compatible with the view that sees a higher purpose and training in the sympathy with sorrow than in participation in reckless frivolity. <span class="cmt_word">For that is the end of all men</span> viz. that they will some day be mourned, that their house will be turned into a house of mourning. Vulgate, In <span class="accented">illa</span> (<span class="accented">dome</span>) <span class="accented">enim finis cunctorum admonetur hominum</span>, which is not the sense of the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">The living will lay it to his heart.</span> He who has witnessed this scene will consider it seriously (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>), and draw from it profitable conclusions concerning the brevity of life and the proper use to make thereof. We recall the words of Christ, "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted;" and "Woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep" (<a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>; <a href="/luke/6-25.htm">Luke 6:25</a>). Schultens gives an Arab proverb which says, "Hearest thou lamentation for the dead, hasten to the spot; art thou called to a banquet, cross not the threshold." The Septuagint thus translates the last clause, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> "The living will put good into his heart;" the Vulgate paraphrases fairly, <span class="accented">Et vivens cogitat quid futurum sit</span>," The living thinks what is to come." "So teach us to number our days," prays the psalmist, "that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom" (<a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For what hath the wise more than the fool; what the poor who knoweth to walk before the living?" The old translators present nothing for the interpretation, but defend the traditional text; for Jerome, like the Syr., which translates freely, follows the Midrash (fixed in the Targ.), which understands &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, contrary to the spirit of the book, of the blessed future. The question would be easier if we could, with Bernst. and Ginsburg, introduce a comparat. min before &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;; we would then require to understand by him who knows to walk before the living, some one who acts a part in public life; but how strange a designation of distinguished persons would that be! Thus, as the text stands, &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; ,sdnat is attrib. to &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, what preference hath the poor, such an one, viz., as understands (vid., regarding &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; instead of &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, under <a href="/psalms/143-10.htm">Psalm 143:10</a>); not: who is intelligent (Aben Ezra); &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; is not, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>, an idea contained in itself, but by the foll. &#1492;&#1495; ... &#1500;&#1492; (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:13</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:14</a>; and the inf. form, <a href="/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-13.htm">Numbers 22:13</a>; <a href="/job/34-23.htm">Job 34:23</a>) obtains the supplement and colouring required: the sequence of the accents (Zakeph, Tifcha, Silluk, as e.g., at <a href="/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a>) is not against this. How the lxx understood its &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, and the Venet. it's &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, is not clear; scarcely as Grtz, with Mendelss.: who, to go against (&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>) life, to fight against it, has to exercise himself in self-denial and patience; for "to fight with life" is an expression of modern coinage. &#1492;&#1495; signifies here, without doubt, not life, but the living. But we explain now, not as Ewald, who separates &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; from the foll. inf. &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;: What profit has then the wise man, the intelligent, patient man, above the fool, that he walks before the living? - by which is meant (but how does this interrog. form agree thereto?), that the wise, patient man has thereby an advantage which makes life endurable by him, in this, that he does not suffer destroying eagerness of desire so to rule over him, but is satisfied to live in quietness.Also this meaning of a quiet life does not lie in the words &#1492;&#1495; ... &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;. "To know to walk before the living" is, as is now generally acknowledged  equals  to understand the right rule of life (Elst.), to possess the savoir vivre (Heiligst.), to be experienced in the right art of living. the question accordingly is: What advantage has the wise above the fool; and what the poor, who, although poor, yet knows how to maintain his social position? The matter treated of is the insatiable nature of sensual desire. The wise seeks to control his desire; and he who is more closely designated poor, knows how to conceal it; for he lays upon himself restraints, that he may be able to appear and make something of himself. But desire is present in both; and they have in this nothing above the fool, who follows the bent of his desire and lives for the day. He is a fool because he acts as one not free, and without consideration; but, in itself, it is and remains true, that enjoyment and satisfaction stand higher than striving and longing for a thing. </body></html>
