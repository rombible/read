It is justly observed by different commentators here, that “we are not hence to infer, that Solomon thought there were fewer good women than men: but that he knew he had not gone the right way to find the virtuous woman, when he deviated so widely from the original law of marriage; and instead of seeking one rational companion, the sole object of his endeared affections, he had collected a vast multitude for magnificence and indulgence. The more valuable part of the sex would not willingly form one in such a group; and, if any of them were previously well disposed, the jealousies, party interests, contests, and artifices which take place in such situations, would tend exceedingly to corrupt them, and render them all nearly of the same character. Solomon therefore here speaks the language of a penitent, warning others against the sins into which he had been betrayed; and not that of a waspish satirist, lashing indiscriminately one half of the human species.” — Scott.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:23-29 Solomon, in his search into the nature and reason of things, had been miserably deluded.

It is the babbling of the people in general that is meant. To this one ought not to turn his heart (&#1500; ... &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>), i.e., gives wilful attention, ne (&#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, which does not occur in the Book of Koheleth) audias servum tuum tibi maledicere; the particip. expression of the pred. obj. follows the analogy of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>, Ewald, 284b, and is not a Graecism; for since in this place hearing is meant, not immediately, but mediated through others, the expression would not in good Greek be with the lxx ... &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;, but &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3b5;. The warning has its motive in this, that by such roundabout hearing one generally hears most unpleasant things; and on hearsay no reliance can be placed. Such gossiping one should ignore, should not listen to it at all; and if, nevertheless, something so bad is reported as that our own servant has spoken words of imprecation against us, yet we ought to pass that by unheeded, well knowing that we ourselves have often spoken harsh words against others. The expression &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, "thou art conscious to thyself that," is like &#1508;&#1468;&#1506; &#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/2-44.htm">1 Kings 2:44</a>, not the obj. accus. dependent on &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; (Hitz.), "many cases where also thou ...," but the adv. accus. of time to &#1511;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;; the words are inverted (Ewald, 336b), the style of Koheleth being fond of thus giving prominence to the chief conception (<a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>).
