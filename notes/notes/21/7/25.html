V., <span class="bld">I and my heart.</span> The expression has no exact parallel in O. T. language, but harmonizes with the common mode of speech, familiar enough in the poetry of all times and countries, furnishing a title (“My Soul and I”) to a poem of Whittier’s, in which a man addresses his heart or soul (comp. <a href="/luke/12-19.htm" title="And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.">Luke 12:19</a>), as something distinguishable from himself. So in ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm" title="And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a> we have “I gave my heart.” Here the thought implied seems to be that of an intense retrospective consciousness of the experience, or experiment, of life which the seeker is about to narrate. The words indicate another return to the results of that experience and the lessons it had taught him. He turned to ask the “<span class="ital">reason</span>,” better perhaps, the <span class="ital">plan</span> or <span class="ital">rationale</span>, of the prevalence of madness and folly. We note, as before in ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm" title="And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that comes after the king? even that which has been already done.">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>, the Stoic manner of dealing with the follies of men as a kind of mental aberration.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I applied mine heart to know</span>; more literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">turned myself</span>, <span class="accented">and my heart was</span> [<span class="accented">set</span>] <span class="accented">to know</span>. We have the expression, "tamed myself," referring to a new investigation in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:20</a> and elsewhere; but the distinguishing the heart or soul from the man himself is not common in Scripture (see on ch. 11:9), though the soul is sometimes apostrophized, as in <a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-1.htm">Psalm 146:1</a>). The writer here implies that he gave up himself with all earnestness to the investigation. Unsatisfactory as his quest had been hitherto. He did not relinquish the pursuit, but rather turned it in another direction, where he could hope to meet with useful results. The Septuagint has, "I and my heart traveled round (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) to know;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Lustravi universa animo meo ut scirem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And to search, and to seek out wisdom.</span> The accumulation of synonymous verbs is meant to emphasize the author's devotion to his self-imposed task and his return from profitless theoretical investigation to practical inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">And the reason of things.</span> <span class="accented">Cheshbon</span> (ver. 27; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>) is rather "account," "reckoning," than "reason " - the summing-up of all the facts and circumstances rather than the elucidation of their causes. Vulgate, <span class="accented">rationem</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The next clause ought to be rendered, <span class="accented">And to know wickedness as</span> (or, <span class="accented">to be</span>) <span class="accented">folly</span>, <span class="accented">and foolishness as</span> (<span class="accented">to be</span>) <span class="accented">madness</span>. His investigation led him to this conclusion, that all infringement of God's laws is a misjudging aberration - a willful desertion of the requirements of right reason - and that mental and moral obtuseness is a physical malady which may be called madness (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Wisdom affords strong protection to the wise man more than ten mighty men who are in the city." We have to distinguish, as is shown under <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">Psalm 31:3</a>, the verbs &#1506;&#1494;&#1494;, to be strong, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, to flee for refuge; &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1494; is the fut. of the former, whence &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;, stronghold, safe retreat, protection, and with &#1500;, since &#1506;&#1494;&#1494; means not only to be strong, but also to show oneself strong, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:20</a>, to feel and act as one strong; it has also the trans. meaning, to strengthen, as shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm">Psalm 68:29</a>, but here the intrans. suffices: wisdom proves itself strong for the wise man. The ten shallithim are not, with Ginsburg, to be multiplied indefinitely into "many mighty men." And it is not necessary, with Desvoeux, Hitz., Zckl., and others, to think of ten chiefs (commanders of forces), including the portions of the city garrison which they commanded. The author probably in this refers to some definite political arrangement, perhaps to the ten archons, like those Assyrian salat&#803;, vice-regents, after whom as eponyms the year was named by the Greeks. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496;, in the Asiatic kingdom, was not properly a military title. And did a town then need protection only in the time of war, and not also at other times, against injury threatening its trade, against encroachments on its order, against the spread of infectious diseases, against the force of the elements? As the Deutero-Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>) says of Jerusalem: "I will make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness," so Koheleth says here that wisdom affords a wise man as strong a protection as a powerful decemvirate a city; cf. <a href="/proverbs/24-5.htm">Proverbs 24:5</a>: "A wise man is ba'oz," i.e., mighty. </body></html>
