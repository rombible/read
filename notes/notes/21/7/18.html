It shelters from the storms and scorching heat of trouble. Wealth will not lengthen out the natural life; but true wisdom will give spiritual life, and strengthen men for services under their sufferings. Let us look upon the disposal of our condition as the work of God, and at last all will appear to have been for the best. In acts of righteousness, be not carried into heats or passions, no, not by a zeal for God. Be not conceited of thine own abilities; nor find fault with every thing, nor busy thyself in other men's matters. Many who will not be wrought upon by the fear of God, and the dread of hell, will avoid sins which ruin their health and estate, and expose to public justice. But those that truly fear God, have but one end to serve, therefore act steadily. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. Every true believer is ready to say, God be merciful to me a sinner. Forget not at the same time, that personal righteousness, walking in newness of life, is the only real evidence of an interest by faith in the righteousness of the Redeemer. Wisdom teaches us not to be quick in resenting affronts. Be not desirous to know what people say; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See that thou approve thyself to God and thine own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee; it is easier to pass by twenty affronts than to avenge one. When any harm is done to us, examine whether we have not done as bad to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Destroy thyself - The Septuagint and Vulgate render it: "be amazed."

Commonly, the first “this” is referred to the “righteousness and wisdom” of <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm" title="Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you destroy yourself ?">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a>, the second “this” to the “wickedness and folly” of <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm" title="Be not over much wicked, neither be you foolish: why should you die before your time?">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>, and the Teacher is supposed to recommend a wide experience of life, the tasting of “the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,” which, as in ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm" title="And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>, shall embrace both, and bring with it a corresponding largeness of heart. This gives, of course, a perfectly intelligible meaning, though it is not that of a high-toned morality, and belongs to the earlier rather than the later stage of the <span class="bld">Debater’s</span> progress. The close parallelism of ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm" title="In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a> suggests however another and preferable interpretation. The first and the second “this” and “that” of that verse are both indefinite, used alike of such work and opportunities as God gives. So taken, the precept now before us runs much in the same line of thought, “Lay hold on this—do not let that slip—do what thy hand findeth to do. Only be sure that it is done in the right spirit, for “he that feareth God,” he, and he alone, “comes forth of all things well,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> does his duty and leaves the result to God. This temper, in exact harmony with the practical good sense of moderation, is contrasted with the falsehood of extremes condemned in the two previous verses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand.</span> The pronouns refer to the two warnings in vers. 16 and 17 against over-righteousness and over-wicked-ness. Koheleth does not advise a man to make trial of opposite lines of conduct, to taste the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that from a wide experience lie may, like a man of the world, pursue a <span class="accented">safe</span> course; <span class="accented">this</span> would be poor <span class="accented">morality</span>, and unmeet for the stage at which his argument has arrived. Rather he advises him to lay to heart fire cautions above given, and learn from them to avoid all extremes. As Horace <span class="accented">says</span> ('Epist.,' 1:18. 9) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Folly, as usual, in extremes is seen,<br />While virtue nicely hits the happy mean."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) The Vulgate has interpolated a word, and taken the pronoun as masculine, to the sacrifice of the sense and connection: <span class="accented">Bonum est te sustentare justum</span>, <span class="accented">sed el ab illo ne subtrahas manum tuam</span>, "<span class="accented">It</span> is good that thou shouldst support the just man, nay, from him withdraw not thy hand." <span class="cmt_word">For he that feareth God shall come forth of them all</span>; shall escape both extremes together with their evil re-suits. The fear of God will keep a man from all excesses. The intransitive verb <span class="accented">yatsa</span>, "to go forth," is here used with an accusative (comp. <a href="/genesis/44-4.htm">Genesis 44:4</a>, which, however, is not quite analogous), as in Latin <span class="accented">ingrediurbem</span> (Livy, 1:29). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui timet Deum nihil negligit</span>. So Hitzig and Ginsburg, "<span class="accented">Goes</span>, makes his way with both," knows how to avail himself of piety and wickedness, which, as we have seen, is not the meaning. St. <span class="accented">Gregory</span>, <span class="accented">indeed</span>, who uses the Latin Version, notes that to fear God is never to pass over any good thing that ought to be aerie ('Moral.,' 1:3); but he is not professing to comment on the whole passage. Wright, after Delitzsch, takes the term "come out of" as equivalent to "fulfill," so that the meaning <span class="accented">would be</span>, "He who fears God performs all the duties mentioned above, and avoids extremes," as <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>, "These ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone." But this is confessedly a Talmudic use of the verb; and the Authorized Version may be safely adopted. The Septuagint gives, "For to them that fear God all things shall come forth well." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Externally connecting itself with "from wisdom," there now follows another proverb, which declares that wisdom along with an inheritance is good, but that wisdom is nevertheless of itself better than money and possessions: "Wisdom is good with family possessions, and an advantage for those who see the sun. For wisdom affordeth a shadow, money affordeth a shadow; yet the advantage of knowledge is this, that wisdom preserveth life to its possessor." Most of the English interpreters, from Desvoeux to Tyler, translate: "Wisdom is as good as an inheritance;" and Bullock, who translates: "with an inheritance," says of this and the other translations: "The difference is not material." But the thought is different, and thus the distinction is not merely a formal one. Zckl. explains it as undoubted that &#1506;&#1501; here, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:16</a> (vid., l.c.), means aeque ac; (but (1) that aeque ac has occurred to no ancient translator, till the Venet. and Luther, nor to the Syr., which translates: "better is wisdom than weapons (&#1502;&#1488;&#1504;&#1488; &#1494;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488;)," in a singular way making <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a> a duplette of <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:18</a>; (2) instead of "wisdom is better than wealth," as e.g., <a href="/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>; (3) the proverb is formed like Aboth ii. 2, "good is study connected with a citizen-like occupation," and similar proverbs; (4) one may indeed say: "the wise man dieth with (together with) the fool"  equals  just as well as the fool; but "good is wisdom with wealth" can neither be equivalent to "as well as wealth," nor: "in comparison with wealth" (Ewald, Elster), but only: "in connection with wealth (possessions);" aeque ac may be translated for una cum where the subject is common action and suffering, but not in a substantival clause consisting of a subst. as subject and an adj. as pred., having the form of a categorical judgment. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; denotes a possession inherited and hereditary (cf. <a href="/proverbs/20-21.htm">Proverbs 20:21</a>); and this is evidence in favour of the view that &#1506;&#1501; is meant not of comparison, but of connection; the expression would otherwise be &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1512; is now also explained. It is not to be rendered: "and better still" (than wealth), as Herzf., Hitz., and Hengst. render it; but in spite of Hengst., who decides in his own way, "&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; never means advantage, gain," it denotes a prevailing good, avantage; and it is explained also why men are here named "those who see the sun" - certainly not merely thus describing them poetically, as in Homer &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is described and coloured by &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;. To see the sun, is  equals  to have entered upon this earthly life, in which along with wisdom, also no inheritance is to be despised. For wisdom affords protection as well as money, but the former still more than the latter. So far, the general meaning of <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a> is undisputed. Buthow is <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a> to be construed? Knobel, Hitz., and others regard &#1489; as the so-called beth essentiae: a shadow (protection) is wisdom, a shadow is money, - very expressive, yet out of harmony, if not with the language of that period, yet with the style of Koheleth; and how useless and misleading would this doubled &#1489;&#1468; be here! Hengstenberg translates: in the shadow of wisdom, at least according to our understanding of <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, is not likened to the shadow of silver; but in conformity with that &#1506;&#1501;, it must be said that wisdom, and also that money, affords a shadow; (2) but that interpretation goes quite beyond the limits of gnomic brachyology. We explain: for in the shadow (&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;, like &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>) is wisdom, in the shadow, money; by which, without any particularly bold poetic licence, is meant that he who possesses wisdom, he who possesses money, finds himself in a shadow, i.e., of pleasant security; to be in the shadow, spoken of wisdom and money, is  equals  to sit in the shadow of the persons who possess both.<p>12b. The exposition of this clause is agreed upon. It is to be construed according to the accentuation: and the advantage of knowledge is this, that "wisdom preserveth life to its possessors." The Targ. regards &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1492;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; as connected genit.; that might be possible (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>), but yet is improbable. Wherever the author uses &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; as subst., it is an independent conception placed beside &#1495;&#1498;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>, etc. We now translate, not: wisdom gives life (lxx, Jerome, Venet., Luther) to its possessors; for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; always means only either to revive (thus Hengst., after <a href="/psalms/119-25.htm">Psalm 119:25</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a>) or to keep in life; and this latter meaning is more appropriate to this book than the former, - thus (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>): wisdom preserves in life, - since, after Hitzig, it accomplishes this, not by rash utterances of denunciation, - a thought lying far behind <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a>, and altogether too mean, - but since it secures it against self-destruction by vice and passions and emotions, e.g., anger (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>), which consume life. The shadow in which wisdom (the wise man) sits keeps it fresh and sound, - a result which the shadow in which money (the capitalist) sits does not afford: it has frequently the directly contrary effect. </body></html>
