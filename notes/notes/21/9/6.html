Solomon exhorts the wise and pious to cheerful confidence in God, whatever their condition in life. The meanest morsel, coming from their Father's love, in answer to prayer, will have a peculiar relish. Not that we may set our hearts upon the delights of sense, but what God has given us we may use with wisdom. The joy here described, is the gladness of heart that springs from a sense of the Divine favour. This is the world of service, that to come is the world of recompence. All in their stations, may find some work to do. And above all, sinners have the salvation of their souls to seek after, believers have to prove their faith, adorn the gospel, glorify God, and serve their generation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now - Rather: "long ago." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. love, and &#8230; hatred, &c.&#8212;(referring to Ec 9:1; see on [666]Ec 9:1). Not that these cease in a future world absolutely (Eze 32:27; Re 22:11); but as the end of this verse shows, relatively to persons and things in this world. Man's love and hatred can no longer be exercised for good or evil in the same way as here; but the fruits of them remain. What he is at death he remains for ever. "Envy," too, marks the wicked as referred to, since it was therewith that they assailed the righteous (see on [667]Ec 9:1).<p>portion&#8212;Their "portion" was "in this life" (Ps 17:14), that they now "cannot have any more."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They neither love, nor hate, nor envy any person or thing in this world, but are now altogether unconcerned in all things done under the sun. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In any thing that is done under the sun; </span> in any worldly thing; by which limitation he sufficiently insinuates his belief of their portion in the other world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished,.... Not that the separate spirits of the dead are without their affections, or these unexercised; the spirits of just men made perfect will love God and Christ, and angels, and good men, and all that is good, more intensely; love will continue after this life, and be in its height, and therefore said to be the greatest grace, <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>; they will hate sin, Satan, and all the enemies of Christ, and be filled with zeal for his glory; so the word (z) for envy may be rendered; see <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>; and the spirits of the wicked dead will still continue to love sin, and hate the Lord, and envy the happiness of the saints; and will rise again with the same spite and malice against them; see <a href="/ezekiel/32-27.htm">Ezekiel 32:27</a>; but this respects persons and things in this world; they no more love persons and things here, nor are loved by any; death parts the best friends, and the most endearing and loving relations, and puts an end to all their mutual friendship and affection; they hate their enemies no more, nor are hated by them; they no more envy the prosperity of others, nor are envied by others; all such kind of love and hatred, enmity and envy, active or passive, cease at death; out of the world, as the Targum adds; <p>neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is under the sun: the worldly man's portion is only in this life, and when he dies, he carries nothing of it with him; whose ever his possessions will be at death, they are no more his, nor will he ever return to enjoy them any more; his houses, his lands, his estates, his gold and silver, and whatever of worth and value he had, he has no more lot and part in them: but the good man has a portion above the sun; God is his portion, heaven is his inheritance for ever and ever. The Targum understands it of the wicked; <p>"and they have no good part with the righteous in the world to come; and they have no profit of all that is done in this world under the sun.'' <p>(z) "aemulatio ipsorum", Cocceius, Gejerus; "aelus eorum", Drusius, Amana, Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished</span>] The three passions are named as strongest and most vehement in their action. Even these are all hushed in the calm of the grave. There are no passions there, and the deadliest foes, rival statesmen and bitter controversialists, rest side by side together. The thought of the state of the dead stands on nearly the same level as that of the elegy of Hezekiah (<a href="/context/isaiah/38-9.htm" title="The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:...">Isaiah 38:9-20</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now</span> (<span class="accented">long ago</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>perished</span>. All the feelings which are exhibited and developed in the life of the upper world are annihilated (comp. ver. 10). Three are selected as the most potent passions, such as by their strength and activity might ideally be supposed to survive even the stroke of death. But all are now at an end. <span class="cmt_word">Neither have they any more a portion forever in any thing that is done under the sun.</span> Between the dead and the living an impassable gulf exists. The view of death here given, intensely gloomy and hopeless as it appears to be, is in conformity with other passages of the Old Testament (see <a href="/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10-14</a>; <a href="/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10-19</a>; Ecclus. 17:27, 28; Bar. 3:16-19), and that imperfect dispensation. Koheleth and his contemporaries were of those "who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage" (<a href="/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a>); it was Christ who brightened the dark valley, showing the blessedness of those who die in the Lord, bringing life and immortality to light through the gospel (<a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>). Some expositors have felt the pessimistic utterances of this passage so deeply that they have endeavored to account for them by introducing an atheistic objector, or an intended opposition between flesh and spirit. But there is not a trace of any two such voices, and the suggestion is quite unnecessary. The writer, while believing in the continued existence of the soul, knows little and has little that is cheering to say about it's condition; and what he does say is not inconsistent with a judgment to come, though he has not yet arrived at the enunciation of this great solution. The Vulgate renders the last clause, <span class="accented">Nec habent partem in hoc saeculo et in opere quod sub sole geritur</span>. But "forever" is the correct rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, and Ginsburg concludes that Jerome's translation can be traced to the Hagadistic interpretation of the verse which restricts its scope to the wicked The author of the Book of Wisdom, writing later, takes a much more hopeful view of death and the departed (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:22-24</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>; 6:18; 8:17; 15:3, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"When I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to view the business which is done on the earth (for neither day nor night doth he see sleep with his eyes): then have I seen all the work of God, that a man is unable to find out the work which is done under the sun: therefore that a man wearieth himself to seek out, and yet findeth not; and although a wise man taketh in hand to know, - he is unable to find." A long period without a premeditated plan has here formed itself under the hand of the author. As it lies before us, it is halved by the vav in veraithi ("then I have seen"); the principal clause, introduced by "when I gave," can nowhere otherwise begin than here; but it is not indicated by the syntactical structure. Yet in Chr. and Neh. apodoses of &#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; begin with the second consec. modus, e.g., <a href="/1_chronicles/17-1.htm">1 Chronicles 17:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a>, and frequently; but the author here uses this modus only rarely, and not (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:7</a>) as a sign of an apodosis.<p>We consider, first, the protasis, with the parenthesis in which it terminates. The phrase &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1489; &#1500;, to direct the heart, to give attention and effort toward something, we have now frequently met with from <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a> down. The aim is here twofold: (1) "to know wisdom" (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>), i.e., to gain the knowledge of that which is wisdom, and which is to be regarded as wisdom, viz., solid knowledge regarding the essence, causes, and objects of things; (2) by such knowledge about that which wisdom is in itself "to see earthly labour," and - this arises from the combination of the two resolutions - to comprehend this labour in accordance with the claims of true wisdom from the point of view of its last ground and aim. Regarding 'inyan, vid., under <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:10</a>. "On the earth" and "under the sun" are parallel designations of this world.<p>With &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; begins a parenthetical clause. Ki may also, it is true, be rendered as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>: the labour on the earth, that he, etc. (Zckl.); but this restlessness, almost renouncing sleep, is thereby pressed too much into the foreground as the special obj. of the reuth (therefore Ginsburg introduces "how that"); thus better to render this clause with ki gam, as establishing the fact that there is 'inyan, self-tormenting, restless labour on the earth. Thus also &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is easier explained, which scarcely goes back to laadam, <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a> (Hitz.), but shows that the author, by )inyan, has specially men in view. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1468; ... &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; is  equals  &#1490;&#1501; &#1489;&#1497; &#1490;&#1501; &#1489;&#1500;: as well by day as by night, with the negat. following (cf. <a href="/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a>): neither by day nor by night; not only by day, but also in the night, not. "To see sleep" is a phrase occurring only here; cf. Terence, Heautontim. iii. 1. 82, Somnum hercle ego hac nocte oculis non vidi meis, for which we use the expression: "In this whole night my eyes have seen no sleep." The not wishing to sleep, and not being able to sleep, is such an hyperbole, carrying its limitation in itself, as is found in Cicero (ad Famil. vii. 30): Fuit mirifica vigilantia, qui toto suo consulatu somnum non vidit.<p>With &#1493;&#1512;, "Then I have seen," begins the apodosis: vidi totum Dei opus non posse hominem assequi. As at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, the author places the obj. in the foreground, and lets the pred. with ki follow (for other examples of this so-called antiposis, vid., under <a href="/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a>). He sees in the labour here below one side of God's work carrying itself forward amid this restless confusion, and sets forth this work of God, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a> (but where the connection of the thoughts is different), as an object of knowledge remaining beyond the reach of man. He cannot come to it, or, as &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; properly means, he reaches not to it, therefore "that a man wearies himself to seek, and yet finds not," i.e., that the search on the part of a man with all his endeavours comes not to its aim. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1499;&#1500; Ewald's emendation, instead of the words of the text before us: for all this, that quantumcunque (Ewald, 362c), which seems to have been approved of by the lxx, Syr., and Jerome, is rightly rejected by Hitzig; beshel asher is Heb., exactly equivalent to Aram. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;, e.g., <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>; and is rightly glossed by Rashi, Kimchi, Michlol 47b, by &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;. The accent dividing the verse stands on yimetsa, for to this word extends the first half of the apodosis, with vegam begins the second. Gam im is  equals  &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, as gam ki is  equals  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;. &#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; is to be understood after &#1488;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a> : also if (although) the wise man resolves to know, he cannot reach that which is to be known. The characteristic mark of the wise man is thus not so much the possession as the striving after it. He strives after knowledge, but the highest problems remain unsolved by him, and his ideal of knowledge unrealized. </body></html>
