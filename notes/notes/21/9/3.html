We may learn many things good for ourselves and useful to others. But man cannot always decide who are objects of God's special love, or under his wrath; and God will certainly put a difference between the precious and the vile, in the other world. The difference as to present happiness, arises from the inward supports and consolations the righteous enjoy, and the benefit they derive from varied trials and mercies. As far as the sons of men are left to themselves, their hearts are full of evil; and prosperity in sin, causes them even to set God at defiance by daring wickedness. Though, on this side death, the righteous and the wicked may often seem to fare alike, on the other side there will be a vast difference between them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>.

A very great evil, a very sore one, the worst of evils. Not an evil, as the providence of God is concerned with it, who does no evil; nor is there any unrighteousness in him; he is righteous in all his ways: but this is an evil, and distressing thing, to the minds of good men; see <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>; and is what bad men make an ill use of, to harden themselves in sin, and to despise religion as an unprofitable thing, <a href="/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14</a>; <p>yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil: they are naturally full of evil, of all unrighteousness and wickedness, what comes out of them show it; and because the same things happen to good and bad men, and the wicked pass with impunity, and are outwardly happy as others, or more so, their hearts are fully set in them to do evil, <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; <p>and madness is in their heart while they live; or "madnesses" (x): every sin is madness; for who but a madman would stretch out his hand against God, and strengthen himself against the Almighty, and run upon him? who but a madman would rush into sin in the manner he does, and expose himself to dangers and death, even eternal death? Wicked men are mad upon their lusts, and mad against the saints, and all that is good; this insanity is in their hearts, and shows itself in their lives, and continues with them as long as they live, unless called by grace; <p>and after that they go to the dead; after all the madness of their lives, they die and go into the state of the dead, and are among which refers not so much to the interment of bodies in the grave, as the company with which their separate spirits are; they go not to the righteous dead, but to the wicked; see <a href="/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>; so Alshech; they go to the dead; not to the righteous, who, in their death, or when dead are called living, but, as Jarchi observes, at their end they go down to hell.

All man’s life, in its vain strivings, its fond hopes, its wild desires, seems to the pessimist but as the “<span class="ital">delirantium somnia</span>.” The English version seems to imply that the writer laid stress on the fact that the evildoers did not continue in existence to bear the penalty they deserved, but rested in the grave like others;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“After life’s fitful fever they sleep well,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>but it is rather the Epicurean thought of death as the common lot, and the sigh with which it is uttered is, as it were, the unconscious protest of the philosophising Hebrew against the outcome of his philosophy. In what he heard of as a “short life and merry” he finds an insanity that ends in nothingness.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun</span>. The "evil" is explained in the following words, which speak of the common fate. The Vulgate (followed by Ginsburg and others) lakes the first words as equivalent to a superlative: <span class="accented">Hoc est pessimum inter omnia</span>, "This is the greatest evil of all that is done under the sun." But the article would have been used in this case; nor would this accurately express Koheleth's sentiments. He looks upon death only as one of the evils appertaining to men's career on earth - one of the phases of that identity of treatment so certain and so inexplicable, which leads to disastrous results (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That there is one event unto all</span>. The "one event," as the end of the verse shows, is death. We have here the old strain repeated which is found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14-16</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; "Omnes eodem cogimur" (Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3. 25). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil.</span> In consequence of this indiscriminating destiny men sin recklessly, are encouraged in their wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Madness is in their heart while they live.</span> The "madness" is conduct opposed to the dictates of wisdom and reason, as <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:2, 12</a>. All their life long men follow their own lusts and passions, and care little for God's will and law, or their own best interests. This is well called "want of reason (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">And after that they go to the dead.</span> The verb is omitted in the Hebrew, being implied by the preposition XXX, "to;" the omission is very forcible. Delitzsch, Wright, and others render, "after him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after man's life is ended, which seems rather to say, "after they die, they die." The idea, however, appears to be, both good and evil go to the same place, pass away into nothingness, are known no more in this world. Here at present Koheleth leaves the question of the future life, having already intimated his belief in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. and Ecclesiastes 8:11, etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"There is a vanity which is done on the earth; that there be just men, to whom it happeneth according to the conduct of the wicked; and that there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the conduct of the righteous - I said, that also this is vain." The limiting clause with ki gam, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a>, is subordinated to the observation specified in <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10-12</a>, and the confirmation of it is continued here in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>. Regarding &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;, to happen, vid., above, p. 639, under &#1504;&#1490;&#1506;. Jerome translates &#1499;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1512; by quasi opera egerint impiorum, and &#1499;&#1501; &#1492;&#1509; by quasi justorum facta habeant; instar operis ... would be better, such as is conformable to the mode of acting of the one and of the other; for &#1499; is in the Semitic style of speech a nomen, which annexes to itself the word that follows it in the genitive, and runs through all the relations of case. This contradictory distribution of destiny deceives, misleads, and causes to err; it belongs to the illusory shadowy side of this present life, it is a hevel. The concluding clause of this verse: "I said, that also this is vain," begins to draw the facit from the observation, and is continued in the verse following. </body></html>
