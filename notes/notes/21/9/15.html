If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A parable probably without foundation in fact.

Christ, who is man, though not a mere man, but God as well as man; who was so in purpose, covenant, and promise, before his incarnation, since truly and really so; and "poor", as it was foretold he should be, and who became so for the sake of his church and people, <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; yet "wise", even as man, being filled with wisdom, in which he increased, and gave such evident proofs of; on whom the spirit of wisdom rested, and in whom the treasures of it were hid, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>; he was found here by God his Father, who exalted one chosen out of the people, and made him Head over the church, who is the firstborn among many brethren, <a href="/psalms/89-19.htm">Psalm 89:19</a>; Or "and", or "but he found in it" (i); that is, Satan, the great king, found him here, contrary to his expectation, and to his great regret; <p>and he by his wisdom delivered the city; the church, from all enemies; from Satan and all his principalities and powers; from the world, the men and things of it; from sin, and all its sad consequences; from the law, its curse and condemnation; and from the second death, ruin and destruction: and though this deliverance was both by power and by price, yet also by wisdom; for the deliverance and redemption of the church by Christ is the fruit of infinite wisdom; it is a wise scheme to glorify all the divine perfections; to mortify Satan, and save sinners, and yet condemn sin; see <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <p>yet no man remembered that same poor man: before the deliverance wrought, as Aben Ezra and others; it never once entered into their thoughts that he could ever be their deliverer; they never imagined he had a capacity to advise, direct, or assist, in such service, or bring about such an affair: so Christ, when he appeared in the world, the Jews saw nothing that was promising in him; they could not believe that he was sent to be the Saviour and deliverer of them, and therefore rejected him, <a href="/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a>; Or, "after it", so the Vulgate Latin version, "no man hereafter remembered", &amp;c. took no notice of him after he had wrought this deliverances; bestowed no honour upon him, nor returned him thanks for what he had done; but he continued to live and die in obscurity and meanness: thus Christ, though he ought to be remembered and spoken well of, and the glory of salvation should be ascribed unto him, and thanks should be given him for it; yet there are none comparatively, or; but a few, who, like the Samaritan, glorify him on account of it. But if any choose to understand these words of political wisdom, and the use of it, by which sometimes a mean and obscure person does more good than others can by their power and strength, though he meets with no reward for it, I am not averse to it; and which agrees with what follows. <p>(i)  "et invenit in ea", Mercerus, Drusius, Amama; "sed invenit in ea", Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">and he by his wisdom delivered the city</span>] The history of the siege of Abel-beth-Maachah in <a href="/context/2_samuel/20-14.htm" title="And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him....">2 Samuel 20:14-20</a> presents a suggestive parallel, but there the wisdom that delivered the city was that of a woman.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Now there was found in it a poor wise man.</span> The verb, regarded as impersonal, may be thus taken. Or we may continue the subject of the preceding verse and consider the king as spoken of: "He came across, met with unexpectedly, a poor man who was wise." So the Septuagint. The word for <span class="accented">"poor"</span> in this passage is <span class="accented">misken</span>, for which see note on Ecclesiastes 4:13. <span class="cmt_word">He by his wisdom delivered the city</span>. When the besieged city had neither soldiers nor arms to defend itself against its mighty enemies, the man of poor estate, hitherto unknown or little regarded, came forward, and by wise counsel relieved his countrymen from their perilous situation. How this was done we are left to conjecture. It may have been by some timely concessions or negotiations; or by the surrender of a chief offender as at Abel-Beth-maachah; or by the assassination of a general, as at Bethulia (Jud. 13:8); or by the clever application of mechanical arts, as at Syracuse, under the direction of Archimedes (Livy, 24:34; Plutarch, 'Marcell.,' 15-18.). Yet no man remembered that same poor man. As soon as the exigence which brought him forward was past, the poor man fell back into his insignificance, and was thought of no more; he gained no personal advantage, by his wisdom; his ungrateful countrymen forgot his very existence. Thus Joseph was treated by the chief butler (<a href="/genesis/40-23.htm">Genesis 40:23</a>). Classical readers will think of Coriolanus, Scipio Africanus, Themistocles, Miltiades, who for their services to the state were rewarded with calumny, false accusation, obloquy, and banishment. The author of the Book of Wisdom gives a different and ideal experience. "I," he says, "for the sake of wisdom shall have estimation among the multitude, and honor with the elders, though I be young.... By the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial" (Wisd. 8:10-13). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a> most translators render: Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest; but the author purposely does not use the word &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, but &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;; and also that he uses &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and not &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, is not without significance. He means: Bring into experience what life, what happiness, is (cf. the indetermin. ideas, <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a>) with a wife whom thou hast loved (Jerome: quaecunque tibi placuerit feminarum), in which there lies indirectly the call to choose such an one; whereby the pessimistic criticism of the female sex, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26-28</a>, so far as the author is concerned, falls into the background, since eudaemonism, the other side of his view of the world, predominates. The accus. designation of time, "through all the days of the life of thy vanity (i.e., of thy transient vain life)," is like <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>. It is repeated in "all the days of thy vanity;" the repetition is heavy and unnecessary (therefore omitted by the lxx, Targ., and Syr.); probably like &#1493;&#1492;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>, a ditto; Hitzig, however, finds also here great emphasis. The relative clause standing after the first designation of time refers to "the days which He (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>) has granted under the sun."
