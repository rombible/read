St. Jerome, as appears by the following paraphrase, considers him as alluding to several facts of the same or a similar kind, “It hath often been seen that a small city and few inhabitants, being beset by an army of innumerable enemies, and besieged so straitly that they were in danger, if not other ways, of perishing by famine; were, on a sudden, contrary to all men’s expectation, delivered by a mean person, who, having more wisdom than all the great and powerful citizens, thought of a way to save them, when they gave themselves up for lost, and effected that of which they utterly despaired. And yet, O the ungratefulness of mankind! after the siege was raised, no one thought of this poor man;” namely, to give him thanks, much less to reward him for their safety. “It sets forth,” says Lord Bacon, “the depraved and malignant nature of mankind; who, in extremities and straits commonly flee to men of wisdom and courage, whom before they despised; but, so soon as the storm is over, they become unthankful wretches to their preservers.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:13-18 A man may, by his wisdom, bring to pass that which he could never do by his strength. If God be for us, who can be against us, or stand before us? Solomon observes the power of wisdom, though it may labour under outward disadvantages. How forcible are right words! But wise and good men must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good, or, at least, endeavoured to do it, when they cannot do the good they would, nor have the praise they should. How many of the good gifts, both of nature and Providence, does one sinner destroy and make waste! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. One sinner may draw many into his destroying ways. See who are the friends and enemies of a kingdom or a family, if one saint does much good, and one sinner destroys much good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, Also this have I seen - wisdom under the sun, and great it seemed to me.<p>From this verse to the end of <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10</a>, the writer inculcates, in a series of proverbs, wisdom in contrast to folly, as the best remedy in the present life to the evil of vanity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The experience which follows he recognized as an instance of worldly wisdom. To what special event he alludes is quite unknown. Probably the circumstance was familiar to his contemporaries. It is not to be considered as an allegory, though of course it is capable of spiritual application. The event in Bible history most like it is the preservation of Abel-Beth-maachah by the counsel of the wise woman (whose name is forgotten) narrated in <a href="/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15-22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And it seemed great unto me</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>, "And it is great before me." To my mind it appeared an important example (comp. <a href="/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>). Some critics who contend for the Solomonic authorship of our book, see here an allegorical reference to the foreseen revolt of Jeroboam, whose insurrection had been opposed by certain wise statesmen, but had been carried out in opposition to their counsel. Wordsworth considers that the apologue may be illustrated by the history of Jerusalem, when great powers were arrayed against it in the time of Isaiah, and the prophet by his prayers and exhortations delivered it (<a href="/2_kings/19-2.htm">2 Kings 19:2, 6, 20</a>), but was wholly disregarded afterwards, nay, was put to death by the son of the king whom he saved. But all this is <span class="accented">nihil ad rem</span>. As Plautus says, "Haec quidem deliramenta loquitur." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Go, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for long ago hath God accepted thy work. Let thy garments be always white; and let not oil be wanting to thy head. Enjoy life with a wife whom thou lovest through all the days of thy vain life, which He hath given thee under the sun - through all thy vain days: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labour wherewith thou weariest thyself under the sun. All that thy hand may find to do with thy might, that do; for there is not work, and calculation, and knowledge, and wisdom, in the under world, whither thou shalt go." Hengstenberg perceives here the counterpart of the spirit; on the contrary, Oetinger, Mendelssohn, and others, discover also here, and here for the first time rightly, the utterance of an epicurean thought. But, in fact, this &#1500;&#1498; down to &#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; is the most distinct personal utterance of the author, his ceterum censeo which pervades the whole book, and here forms a particularly copious conclusion of a long series of thoughts. We recapitulate this series of thoughts: One fate, at last the same final event, happens to all men, without making any distinction according to their moral condition, - an evil matter, so much the more evil, as it encourages to wickedness and light-mindedness; the way of man, without exception, leads to the dead, and all further prospect is cut off; for only he who belongs to the class of living beings has a joyful spirit, has a spirit of enterprise: even the lowest being, if it live, stands higher in worth, and is better, than the highest if it be dead; for death is the end of all knowledge and feeling, the being cut off from the living under the sun. From this, that there is only one life, one life on this side of eternity, he deduces the exhortation to enjoy the one as much as possible; God Himself, to whom we owe it, will have it so that we enjoy it, within the moral limits prescribed by Himself indeed, for this limitation is certainly given with His approbation. Incorrectly, the Targ., Rashi, Hengst. Ginsb., and Zckl. explain: For thy moral conduct and effort have pleased Him long ago - the person addressed is some one, not a definite person, who could be thus set forth as such a witness to be commended. Rather with Grotius and others: Quia Deus favet laboribus tuis h. e. eos ita prosperavit, ut cuncta quae vitam delectant abunde tibi suppetant. The thought is wholly in the spirit of the Book of Koheleth; for the fruit of labour and the enjoyment of this fruit of labour, as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, etc., is a gift from above; and besides, this may be said to the person addressed, since 7a presupposes that he has at his disposal heart-strengthening bread and heart-refreshing wine. But in these two explanations the meaning of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is not comprehended. It was left untranslated by the old translators, from their not understanding it. Rightly, Aben Ezra: For God wills that thou shouldst thus to [indulge in these enjoyments]; more correctly, Hitzig: Long ago God has beforehand permitted this thy conduct, so that thou hast no room for scruples about it. How significant &#1499;&#1489;&#1512; is for the thought, is indicated by the accentuation which gives to it Zakef: from aforetime God has impressed the seal of His approbation on this thy eating with joy, this thy drinking with a merry heart. - The assigning of the reason gives courage to the enjoyment, but at the same time gives to it a consecration; for it is the will of God that we should enjoy life, thus it is self-evident that we have to enjoy it as He wills it to be enjoyed.</body></html>
