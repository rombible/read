Which Solomon had observed in the course of his life, practised in some kingdoms and by some princes on earth, under the sun; for there is nothing of the like kind, as after mentioned, done in heaven, above the sun; <p>as an error which proceedeth from the ruler; from the supreme ruler of a nation, the king of it; and it is not only as an error, or like one, a seeming one; but it is a real error, bestowing places of honour and profit on undeserving persons: which error proceeds from ignorance of the persons; or from affection to them, and from friendship cultivated with them in the younger time of life, being educated with them; or through the misrepresentation and imposition of those about him, who have ends to serve by their promotion; or through his own lusts and passions, which these men indulge him in.

It might be wise at times to bow to the temper of a despotic ruler, but the ruler was not always right. What the <span class="bld">Debater</span> had seen was to him a blot upon the government of him who allowed it. There lies below the surface the half-suppressed thought that this anomaly, stated in the next verse, was as a blot in the government of the supreme Ruler of the Universe. Technically the word was used in the Mosaic Law of the involuntary sins of ignorance (<a href="/leviticus/4-22.htm" title="When a ruler has sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;">Leviticus 4:22</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-27.htm" title="And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he does somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;">Leviticus 4:27</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-18.htm" title="And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 5:18</a>). The unequal distribution of honours seemed to men as a blunder of Providence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Koheleth gives his personal experience of apparent confusion in the ordering of state affairs. <span class="cmt_word">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun.</span> Power gets into the hands of an unwise man, and then errors are committed and injustice reigns. <span class="cmt_word">As an error which proceedeth from the ruler.</span> The <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> here is <span class="accented">cash veritatis</span>, which denotes not comparison, but resemblance, the idealization of the individual, the harmony of the particular with the general idea. The evil which he noticed appeared to be (he does not affirm that it is) a mistake caused by the ruler; it so presented itself to his mind. The caution observed in the statement may be owing partly to the tacit feeling that such blots occasioned difficulties in the view taken of the moral government of the world. He does not intend to refer to God under the appellation "Ruler." The Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "As if it came involuntarily;" Vulgate, to much the same effect, <span class="accented">Quasi per errorem egrediens</span>. The idea here is either gnat the evil is one not produced by any intentional action of the ruler, but resulting from human imperfection, or that what appears to be a mistake is not so really. But these interpretations are unsuitable. Those who adhere to the Solomonic authorship of our book see here a prophetic intimation of the evil of Jeroboam's rule, which evil proceeded from the sins of Solomon himself and his son Rehoboam. (So Wordsworth, Motais, etc.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The words of the wise, heard in quiet, have the superiority above the cry of a ruler among fools." Instead of tovim min, there stands here the simple min, prae, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a>, to express the superiority of the one to the other. Hitzig finds in this proverb the meaning that, as that history has shown, the words of the wise, heard with tranquillity, gain the victory over the cry of a ruler over fools. But (1) the contrast of &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; and &#1494;&#1506;&#1511;&#1514; require us to attribute the tranquillity to the wise man himself, and not to his hearers; (2) &#1502;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1498;&#1468; is not a ruler over fools, by which it would remain questionable whether he himself was not a fool (cf. <a href="/job/41-26.htm">Job 41:26</a>), but a ruler among fools (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>, &#1502;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;, "a ruler among men;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a>, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;, "the hero among beasts"), i.e., one who among fools takes the place of chief. The words of the poor wise man pass by unheeded, they are not listened to, because he does not possess an imposing splendid outward appearance, in accordance with which the crowd estimate the value of a man's words; the wise man does not seek to gain esteem by means of a pompous violent deportment; his words &#1504;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468; are heard, let themselves be heard, are to be heard (cf. e.g., Sol 2:12) in quiet (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>); for, trusting to their own inward power of conviction, and committing the result to God, he despises vociferous pomp, and the external force of earthly expedients (cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-2.htm">Isaiah 42:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-19.htm">Matthew 12:19</a>); but the words of the wise, which are to be heard in unassuming, passionless quietness, are of more value than the vociferation with which a king among fools, an arch-fool, a non plus ultra among fools, trumpets forth his pretended wisdom and constrains his hearers. </body></html>
