The Targum paraphrases it, <p>"shall be burnt with fire, by the hand of the Angel of the Lord:'' <p>or, however, he may be overheated and do himself hurt, as men, that kindle the flame of contention and strife, often do. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith</span>] The words are referred by some commentators to an act like that of the previous verse, by others to hewing stone in the quarry. In the former case, however, we get but a tame repetition, in the latter there is nothing in the act that deserves retribution. We get a more natural meaning, if we think of the curse pronounced on him who “removes his neighbour’s landmark” (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-14.htm" title="You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in your inheritance, which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-17.htm" title="Cursed be he that removes his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>). Such landmarks often consisted of cairns or heaps of stones, as in <a href="/context/genesis/31-46.htm" title="And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there on the heap....">Genesis 31:46-48</a>, or a pillar, and the act of removing it would be one of wrongful aggression. For the stone to fall on a man so acting would be once more an instance of the Nemesis which is presented in these similitudes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby</span>] Better, “he that cleaveth <span class="bld">trees</span> or <span class="bld">logs</span>,” as in <a href="/genesis/1-11.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: and it was so.">Genesis 1:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/2-16.htm" title="And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:">Genesis 2:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-20.htm" title="He that is so impoverished that he has no oblation chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks to him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.">Isaiah 40:20</a>, and elsewhere. Here again the proverb seems to have a double edge. (1) On the one hand it might seem that an act of unjust aggression is contemplated. The special sacredness of trees as standing above most other forms of property is recognised in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/20-19.htm" title="When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an ax against them: for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:...">Deuteronomy 20:19-20</a>, and the frequency of accidents in the process was provided for by the special legislation (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-5.htm" title="As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the helve, and lights on his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee to one of those cities, and live:">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>), which exempted from penalty one who in this way was the involuntary cause of his neighbour’s death. The primary thought in the saying, so taken, is, as before, that retribution comes on the evil-doer out of the very deed of evil. Out of our “pleasant vices” the gods “make whips to scourge us.” The attack on sacred and time-honoured institutions is not without peril. (2) On the other hand, eastern as well as western thought recognises in decayed trees the types of corrupt institutions that need to be reformed, and, as in the last proverb, the work of the reformer is not always a safe or easy one. Popular political rhetoric has made us familiar both with the appeal to “spare the tree” under the shadow of whose branches our fathers lived, and with that which bids men lop branch after branch from the “deadly Upas” of oppression and iniquity, especially of corrupt kingdoms (<a href="/isaiah/14-8.htm" title="Yes, the fir trees rejoice at you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since you are laid down, no feller is come up against us.">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-15.htm" title="He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heaven by his understanding.">Jeremiah 51:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-3.htm" title="You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock.">Ezekiel 34:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-10.htm" title="Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.">Daniel 9:10</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-14.htm" title="Therefore has the LORD watched on the evil, and brought it on us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice.">Daniel 9:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-10.htm" title="And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.">Matthew 3:10</a>; <a href="/luke/13-7.htm" title="Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why encumbers it the ground?">Luke 13:7</a>; <a href="/luke/13-9.htm" title="And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.">Luke 13:9</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith</span>. It is natural to consider this clause as suggested by the breaking of a wall in the preceding verse; but as this would occasion a jejune repetition, it is better to take it of the work of the quarryman, as in <a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>, where the same verb is used. The dangers to which such laborers are exposed are well known. Here, again, but unsuccessfully, some have seen a reference to the removal of landmarks, comparing <a href="/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4</a>, where the word is translated "set aside." As before said, the paragraph does not speak of retribution, but advises caution, enforcing the lesson by certain homely, allusions to the accidents that may occur m customary occupations. <span class="cmt_word">He that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</span> Cutting up logs of wood, a man may hurt himself with axe or saw, or be injured by splinters, etc. If we take the idea to be the felling of trees, there is the danger of being crushed in their fall, or, according to the tenor of <a href="/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>, of being killed inadvertently by a neighbor's axe. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui scindit ligna vulnerabitur ab eis</span>, which is more definite than the general term "endangered;" but the Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the Authorized Version. Plumptre sees here, again, an intimation of the danger of attacking time-honored institutions, even when decaying and corrupt. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This proverb forms, along with the preceding, a tetrastich, for it is divided into two parts by vav. The Ker&#305;&#770; has removed the art. in &#1499;&#1513; and &#1513;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>, as incompatible with the &#1513;. The order of the words vegam-baderek keshehsachal holek is inverted for vegam keshehsachal baderek holek, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, and also rav she&#780;yihyn, <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3</a>; so far as this signifies, "supposing that they are many." Plainly the author intends to give prominence to "on the way;" and why, but because the fool, the inclination of whose heart, according to 2b, always goes to the left, is now placed in view as he presents himself in his public manner of life. Instead of &#1500;&#1489;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1495;&#1505;&#1512; we have here the verbal clause &#1495;&#1505;&#1512; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, which is not, after <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>, to be translated: corde suo caret (Herzf., Ginsb.), contrary to the suff. and also the order of the words, but, after <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a> : cor ejus deficit, i.e., his understanding is at fault; for &#1500;&#1489;, here and at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:2</a>, is thus used in a double sense, as the Greek &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; and the Lat. mens can also be used: there it means pure, formal, intellectual soul-life; here, pregnantly (Psychol. p. 249), as at <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>, the understanding or the knowledge and will of what is right. The fool takes no step without showing that his understanding is not there, - that, so to speak, he does not take it along with him, but has left it at home. He even carries his folly about publicly, and prides himself in it as if it were wisdom: he says to all that he is a fool, se esse stultum (thus, correctly, most Jewish and Christian interpreters, e.g., Rashi and Rambach). The expression follows the scheme of <a href="/psalms/9-21.htm">Psalm 9:21</a>: May the heathen know mortales se esse (vid., l.c.). Otherwise Luther, with Symm. and Jerome: "he takes every man as a fool;" but this thought has no support in the connection, and would undoubtedly be expressed by &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1505;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. Still differently Knobel and Ewald: he says to all, "it is foolish;" Hitzig, on the contrary, justly remarks that &#1505;&#1499;&#1500; is not used of actions and things; this also is true of &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, against himself, <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>, where he translates qol kesil by "foolish discourses." </body></html>
