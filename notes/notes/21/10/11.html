Literally translated it is, <span class= "ital">If the serpent bite for lack of enchantment, there is no advantage to the master of the tongue. </span>It seems best to follow the LXX. and other interpreters, and take the “master of the tongue” to mean the snake charmer, who possesses the “voice of the charmer” (<a href="/psalms/58-5.htm" title="Which will not listen to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.">Psalm 58:5</a>). The whisperings of the snake charmer, so often described by Eastern travellers, are referred to also in <a href="/jeremiah/8-17.htm" title="For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:17</a>, and in a passage, probably founded on the present text (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/12-13.htm" title="Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts?">Ecclesiasticus 12:13</a>), “Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent?” The mention of the serpent in <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm" title="He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoever breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a> seems to have suggested another illustration of the advantage of wisdom in the different effects of snake-charming, as used by the expert or the unskilful. The phrase, “master of the tongue,” seems to have been chosen in order to lead on to the following verses, which speak of the different use of the tongue by the wise man and the fool.<p><span class= "bld">Enchantment.</span>—According to the primary meaning “whispering” (<a href="/2_samuel/12-19.htm" title="But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead?

This is an allusion to the general opinion, then and still prevailing in the eastern countries, that serpents might be charmed so as to be prevented from biting by certain incantations, or by singing and music.

The babbler's tongue is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison; and contradiction only makes it the more violent. We must find the way to keep him gentle. But by rash, unprincipled, or slanderous talk, he brings open or secret vengeance upon himself. Would we duly consider our own ignorance as to future events, it would cut off many idle words which we foolishly multiply. Fools toil a great deal to no purpose. They do not understand the plainest things, such as the entrance into a great city. But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city, that it is a high-way, in which the simplest wayfaring men shall not err, Isa 25:8. But sinful folly makes men miss that only way to happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather: "If a serpent without enchantment (i. e., not being enchanted) bites, then there is no advantage to the charmer": i. e., if the charmer is unwisely slack in exercising his craft, he will be bitten like other people.

A "serpent will bite" if "enchantment" is not used; "and a babbling calumniator is no better." Therefore, as one may escape a serpent by charms (Ps 58:4, 5), so one may escape the sting of a calumniator by discretion (Ec 10:12), [Holden]. Thus, "without enchantment" answers to "not whet the edge" (Ec 10:10), both expressing, figuratively, want of judgment. Maurer translates, "There is no gain to the enchanter" (Margin, "master of the tongue") from his enchantments, because the serpent bites before he can use them; hence the need of continual caution. Ec 10:8-10, caution in acting; Ec 10:11 and following verses, caution in speaking.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Without enchantment; </span> if not seasonably prevented by the art and care of the charmer; which practice he doth not justify, but only mention by way of resemblance.

But I do not see either why this phrase should be limited to the detractor, which equally belongs to all abusers of the tongue in any other way; or how this particular vice of detraction comes to be inserted here among things of a quite differing nature.

It is hardly necessary to dwell at length on a topic so familiar as the serpent-charming of the East. It will be enough to say that from time immemorial in Egypt, Syria, Persia, India, there have been classes of persons who in some way or other have gained a power over many kinds of snakes, drawing them from their retreats, handling them with impunity, making them follow their footsteps like a tame dog. The power was really or ostensibly connected with certain muttered words or peculiar intonations of the voice. We find the earliest traces of it in the magicians of Pharaoh’s court (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>). So the “deaf adder that cannot be charmed” becomes the type of those whom no appeal to reason or conscience can restrain (<a href="/psalms/58-5.htm" title="Which will not listen to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.">Psalm 58:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-17.htm" title="For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 8:17</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/12-13.htm" title="Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts?">Sir 12:13</a>). The proverb obviously stands in the same relation to the “breaking down of walls” in <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm" title="He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoever breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a>, as that of the “blunt axe” did to the “cutting down trees” of <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm" title="Whoever removes stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that splits wood shall be endangered thereby.">Ecclesiastes 10:9</a>. “If a serpent meets you as you go on with your work, if the adder’s poison that is on the lips of the traitor or the slanderer (<a href="/psalms/140-3.htm" title="They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.">Psalm 140:3</a>; <a href="/romans/3-13.htm" title="Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:">Romans 3:13</a>) is about to do its deadly work, are you sure that you have the power to charm? If not, you are not likely to escape being bitten.” The apodosis of the sentence interprets the proverb. “If a serpent will bite in the absence of the charmer, <span class="bld">there is no profit in a babbler</span> (literally, <span class="bld">a lord</span> or <span class="bld">master of tongue</span>, see note on ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm" title="He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance with increase: this is also vanity.">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>), who does not know the secret of the intonation that charms it.” No floods of wind-bag eloquence will-avail in the statesman or the orator if the skill that persuades is wanting.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The last proverb of this little series shows the necessity of seizing the right opportunity. <span class="cmt_word">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment.</span> The Authorized Version is not quite correct. The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dd;</span>, with which the verse begins, is here conditional, and the rendering should be, <span class="accented">If the serpent bite</span>, etc.; the apodosis comes in the next clause. The idea is taken up from ver. 8. If one handles a serpent without due precaution or without knowing the secret of charming it, one will suffer for it. The taming and charming of poisonous snakes is still, as heretofore, practiced in Egypt and the East. What the secret of this power is has not been accurately determined; whether it belongs especially to persons of a certain idiosyncrasy, whether it is connected with certain words or intonations of the voice or musical sounds, we do not know. Of the existence of the power from remote antiquity there can be no question. Allusions to it in Scripture are common enough (see <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>; Ecclus. 12:13). If a serpent before it is charmed is dangerous, what then? The Authorized Version affords no sensible apodosis: <span class="cmt_word">And a babbler is no better</span>. The words rendered "babbler" (<span class="accented">baul hallashon</span>) are literally "master of the tongue," and by them is meant the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "the serpent-charmer." The clause should <span class="accented">run, Then there is no use in the charmer</span>. If the man is bitten before he has time to use his charm, it is no profit to him that he has the secret, it is too late to employ it when the mischief is done. This is to shut the stable door after the steed is stolen. The maxim enforces the warning against being too late; the greatest skill is useless unless applied at the right moment. The Septuagint translates virtually as above, "If a serpent bites when not charmed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>), then there is no advantage to the charmer (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1fb4;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>)." The Vulgate departs from the context, rendering, <span class="accented">Si mordeat serpens in silentio</span> (i.e. probably "uncharmed"), <span class="accented">nihil eo minus habet qui occulte detrahit</span>, "He is nothing better who slanders secretly," which St. Jerome thus explains: the serpent and the slanderer are alike, for as the serpent stealthily infuses its poison, so the secret slanderer pours his venom into another's breast. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceedeth from the ruler." The introduction by the virtual relative raithi is as at <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>. Knobel, Hengst., and others give to the &#1499; of &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; the meaning of "according to," or "in consequence of which," which harmonizes neither with ra'ah nor with raithi. Also Kleinert's translation: "There is a misery - I have seen it under the sun - in respect of an error which proceedeth from the ruler," is untenable; for by this translation ra'ah is made the pred. while it is the subj. to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, and kishgagah the unfolding of this subject. Hitzig also remarks: "as [wie ein] an error, instead of which we have: in respect to [um einen] an error;" for he confounds things incongruous. Hitz., however, rightly recognises, as also Kleinert, the &#1499; as Caph veritatis, which measures the concrete with the idea. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, compares the individual with the general which therein comes to view, <a href="/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-2.htm">Nehemiah 7:2</a>; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/9-8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>. Koheleth saw an evil under the sun; something which was like an error, appeared to him altogether like an error which proceedeth from the ruler. If we could translate &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468; by quod exiit, then &#1499; would be the usual Caph similitudinis; but since it must be translated by quod exit, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1499;&#1513;&#1473; places the observed fact under a comprehensive generality: it had the nature of an error proceeding from the ruler. If this is correct, it is so much the less to be assumed that by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1496; God is to be understood (<a href="/daniel/5-21.htm">Daniel 5:21</a>), as Jerome was taught by his Hebraeus: quod putent homines in hac inaequalitate rerum illum non juste et ut aequum est judicare. It is a governor in a state that is meant, by whom an error might easily be committed, and only too frequently is committed, in the promotion of degradation of persons. But since the world, with its wonderful division of high and low, appears like as it were an error proceeding from the Most High, there certainly falls a shadow on the providence of God Himself, the Governor of the world; but yet not so immediately that the subject of discourse is an "error" of God, which would be a saying more than irreverent. &#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;  equals  &#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; is the metaplastic form for &#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492; or &#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514; (for which at <a href="/deuteronomy/28-57.htm">Deuteronomy 28:57</a> incorrectly &#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1514;), not an error of transcription, as Olsh. supposes; vid., to the contrary. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; (Symm. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) with &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; is the old usus loq. There now follows a sketch of the perverted world. </body></html>
