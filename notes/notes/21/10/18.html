Money, of itself, will neither feed nor clothe, though it answers the occasions of this present life, as what is to be had, may generally be had for money. But the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained with corruptible things, as silver and gold. God sees what men do, and hears what they say in secret; and, when he pleases, brings it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. If there be hazard in secret thoughts and whispers against earthly rulers, what must be the peril from every deed, word, or thought of rebellion against the King of kings, and Lord of lords! He seeth in secret. His ear is ever open. Sinner! curse not THIS KING in thy inmost thought.

Or, "by slothfulnesses" (g), The word is in the dual number, and so may signify the slothfulness of the hands, as Aben Ezra, of both hands, and of both feet; or the various kinds of slothfulness, as the Arabic version, slothfulness both of body and mind; or of all sorts of persons, superiors and inferiors, princes and subjects; and with respect to all things present and future: and, as through slothfulness a material building decays; or a "beam", as the word signifies, the raftering of a house, the roof, which consists of rafters and beams joined together when the tiling is decayed by winds and rains, or any breaches made in the rafters, and no care taken to repair, the whole falls in, and the house is in ruins: so figurative buildings, families, churches, and kingdoms, come to nothing, through the sluggishness of masters of families, ministers of the word, and civil magistrates; to the latter of which more especially this is to be applied, who give up themselves to luxury and sloth; <p>and, through idleness of the hands, the house droppeth through; or, "through the letting" or "hanging down of the hands" (h); the remissness of them, as is to be observed in idle persons, who will not lift them up to work; particularly to repair a breach in a house, by means of which the rain drops through it, and makes it uncomfortable and unsafe being in it; and, in process of time, that itself drops to the ground: and this expresses the same thing, how, through the neglect of the civil magistrate, a commonwealth comes to nothing; or, however, the members of it become wretched and miserable. <p>(g) "in pigritiis", Montanus; "per duplicem pigritiam", Tigurine version; "pigritia amborum", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

There, <span class="ital">laissez-faire</span>, the policy of indolent procrastination, may be as fatal to the good government and prosperity of a state as the most reckless profligacy. The figure is singularly apt. The fabric of a state, like that of the house (<a href="/amos/9-11.htm" title="In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:">Amos 9:11</a>), needs from time to time to be surveyed and repaired. “Time,” as Bacon has said, “alters all things” (houses of both kinds included) “for the worse.” “The <span class="bld">timber framework</span> of the house decays.” The decay may be hidden at first (this seems the point implied in the relation of the two parts of the proverb) but the latent cause soon shews itself in a very patent effect, “The house <span class="bld">lets in the rain</span>,” there is the “continual dropping,” the “drip, drip, drip,” which, to the householder seeking comfort, is the type of all extremest discomfort (<a href="/proverbs/19-13.htm" title="A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.">Proverbs 19:13</a>). Delitzsch quotes a curious Arab proverb that “there are three things that make a house intolerable, rain leaking through the roof, an ill-tempered wife, and the <span class="ital">cimex lectularius</span>.” So is it with the state. The timbers are the fundamental laws or principles by which its fabric is supported. Corruption or discord (the “beginning of strife” which is “as when one letteth out of water,” <a href="/proverbs/17-14.htm" title="The beginning of strife is as when one lets out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.">Proverbs 17:14</a>) is the visible token that these are worm-eaten and decayed through long neglect.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By much slothfulness the building decayeth</span>. The subject is still the state. Under the image of a house which falls into ruin for lack of needful repairs, is signified the decay that surely overtakes a kingdom whose rulers are given up to indolence and debauchery, and neglect to attend to the affairs which require prompt care (comp. <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>). Such were they whom Amos (<a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) denounced, "That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph." "Much slothfulness" is expressed in the original by a dual form, which gives an intensive signification. Ewald and Ginsburg take it as referring to the "two idle hands;" but the intensifications of the dual is not unprecedented (see Delitzsch, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The rest of this clause is more accurately rendered, <span class="accented">the rafters sink, i.e.</span> the timber framework, whether of roof or wall, gives way. This may possibly not be noticed at once, but it makes itself known unmistakably ere long. <span class="cmt_word">And through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the house leaketh</span>, the roof lets in the rain. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "Through laziness of hands the house will drip." The very imperfect construction of the fiat roofs of Eastern houses demanded continual attention. Such common and annoying occurrences as a leaky roof are mentioned in the Book of Proverbs (see 19:13; 27:15). Plautus, ' Mostell.,' 1:2.28 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ventat imber, lavit parietes; perpluunt<br />Tigna; putrefacit aer operam fabri."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The rain comes down, and washes all the walls,<br />The roof is leaky, and the weather rough<br />Loosens the architect's most skilful work."</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The words of a wise man's mouth are grace; but the lips of a fool swallow him up." The words from a wise man's mouth are &#1495;&#1503;, graciousness, i.e., gracious in their contents, their form and manner of utterance, and thus also they gain favour, affection, approbation, for culture (education) produces favour, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>, and its lips grace (pleasantness), which has so wide an influence that he can call a king his friend, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-11.htm">Proverbs 22:11</a>, although, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>, that does not always so happen as is to be expected. The lips of a fool, on the contrary, swallow him, i.e., lead him to destruction. The Pih. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;, which at <a href="/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a> means to swallow down, and at <a href="/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a> to swallow  equals  to consume in luxury, to spend dissolutely, has here the metaphorical meaning of to destroy, to take out of the way (for that which is swallowed up disappears). &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; is parallel form to &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;, like the Aram. &#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;. The construction is, as at <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/14-3.htm">Proverbs 14:3</a>, "the lips of the wise &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; preserve them;" the idea of unity, in the conception of the lips as an instrument of speech, prevails over the idea of plurality. The words of the wise are heart-winning, and those of the fool self-destructive. This is verified in the following verse. </body></html>
