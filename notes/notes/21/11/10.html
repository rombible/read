Here is a caution to think of death, even when life is most sweet. Solomon makes an effecting address to young persons. They would desire opportunity to pursue every pleasure. Then follow your desires, but be assured that God will call you into judgment. How many give loose to every appetite, and rush into every vicious pleasure! But God registers every one of their sinful thoughts and desires, their idle words and wicked words. If they would avoid remorse and terror, if they would have hope and comfort on a dying bed, if they would escape misery here and hereafter, let them remember the vanity of youthful pleasures. That Solomon means to condemn the pleasures of sin is evident. His object is to draw the young to purer and more lasting joys. This is not the language of one grudging youthful pleasures, because he can no longer partake of them; but of one who has, by a miracle of mercy, been brought back in safety. He would persuade the young from trying a course whence so few return. If the young would live a life of true happiness, if they would secure happiness hereafter, let them remember their Creator in the days of their youth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense appears to be, "Let the timely recollection of God's judgment, and of the fleeting character of youth, so influence your conduct that you will refrain from acts which entail future remorse and pain." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. sorrow&#8212;that is, the lusts that end in "sorrow," opposed to "rejoice," and "heart cheer thee" (Ec 11:9), Margin, "anger," that is, all "ways of thine heart"; "remove," &c., is thus opposed to "walk in," &c.

Worldly sorrow, as opposed to lawful mirth and cheerfulness, and especially to spiritual joy: or "anger" (z), as the word may be rendered, and often is; either at the providence of God, or at the correction of friends; all perturbations of the mind; all fierceness of spirit, and fiery passions, to which youthful age is subject: or all those things, as Jarchi observes, that provoke God to anger; sinful lusts and pleasures, the end and issue of which also is sorrow to men; and which agrees with our version; <p>and put away evil from thy flesh; or body; such as intemperance and uncleanness, to which young men are addicted: the advice is much the same, in both clauses, with that of the apostle's, "flee youthful lusts", <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>. Jarchi interprets this of the evil concupiscence; <p>for childhood and youth are vanity; which quickly pass away; come into manhood, and soon slide into old age, and are gone presently, and all things within that compass: all actions done in that age are for the most part vain and foolish; and all the delights, joys, and pleasures thereof, vanishing and transitory. The last word (a), used to express the juvenile age, either is akin to a word which signifies the "morning"; youth being the morning and dawn of man's age, and increases as that; and as soon as it is peep of day with him, or he enters into life, he possesses vanity: or as having the signification of "blackness"; because, as Jarchi observes, the head of a young man is black: and so the Targum, <p>"childhood, and the days of blackness of hair, are vanity;'' <p>whereas the hair of an aged man is gray. <p>(z) "iram", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus; "indignationem", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Gejerus; "God's anger", Broughton.

We are not to look on the dark side of things, but to cultivate cheerfulness, to be “content” (<span class="greekheb">αὐτάρκης</span>) with whatever life brings us (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm" title="Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content.">Php 4:11</a>). And the “flesh” too has its claims which may legitimately be recognised. We need not vex it with the self-inflicted tortures of the ascetic, but, in a sense as far as possible different from “the rehabilitation of the flesh” which has been made the plea for an unrivalled sensuality, consider and meet its capacities for pure and innocent enjoyment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">childhood and youth are vanity</span>] The Hebrew word for “youth” is an unusual one and is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament. It has been differently explained: (1) as the dawn or morning of life, the period of its brightness; and (2) as the time when the hair is black as contrasted with the grey hair of age. Of these (1) seems preferable. The prominent idea of “vanity” here is that of transitoriness. The morning will not last. It is wise to use it while we can.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10</span> - <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>. - Section 18. The <span class="accented">third remedy is piety</span>, and this ought to be practiced from one's earliest days; life should be so guided as not to offend the laws of the Creator and Judge, and virtue should not be postponed till the failure of faculties makes pleasure unattainable, and death closes the scene. The last days of the old man are beautifully described under certain images, metaphors, and analogies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart.</span> The writer reiterates his advice concerning cheerfulness, and then proceeds to inculcate early piety. <span class="accented">Kaas</span>, rendered "sorrow," has been variously understood. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">gram</span>; so the margin of the Authorized Version gives "anger," and that of the Revised Version "vexation," or "provocation." Wordsworth adopts this last meaning (relating to <a href="/1_kings/15-30.htm">1 Kings 15:30</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-22.htm">1 Kings 21:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>, etc., where, however, the signification is modified by the connection in which the word stands), and paraphrases, "Take heed lest you provoke God by the thoughts of your heart." Jerome affirms that in the term "anger" all perturbations of the mind are included - which seems rather forced. The word is better rendered, low spirits, moroseness, discontent. These feelings are to be put away from the mind by a deliberate act. <span class="cmt_word">Put away evil from thy flesh</span>. Many commentators consider that the evil here named is physical, not moral, the author enjoining his young disciple to take proper care of his body, not to weaken it on the one hand by asceticism, nor on the other by indulgence in youthful lusts. In this case the two clauses would urge the removal of what respectively affects the mind and body, the inner and outer man. But the ancient versions are unanimous in regarding the "evil" spoken of as moral. Thus the  Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "wickedness;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">malitiam</span>. Similarly the Syriac and Targum. And according to our interpretation of the passage, such is the meaning here. It is a call to early piety and virtue, like that of St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), "Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." Do not, says Koheleth, defile thy body by carnal sins (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>), which bring decay and sickness, and arouse the wrath of God against thee<span class="cmt_word">. For childhood and youth are vanity.</span> This time of youth soon passes away; the capacity for enjoyment is soon circumscribed; therefore use thy opportunities aright, remembering the end. The word for "youth" (<span class="accented">shacharuth</span>) occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament, and is probably connected with <span class="accented">shachon</span>, "black," used of hair in <a href="/leviticus/13-31.htm">Leviticus 13:31</a>. Hence it means the time of black hair, in contradistinction to the time when the hair has become grey. The explanation which refers it to the time of dawn (Psalm 110:8) seems to be erroneous, as it would then be identical with" childhood." The Septuagint renders it <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "folly;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">voluptas</span>, "pleasure;" the Syriac, "and not knowledge, but the word cannot be rightly thus translated. The two terms are childhood and manhood, the period during which the capacity for pleasure is fresh and strong. Its vanity is soon brought home; it is evanescent; it brings punishment. Thus Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I cast mine eyes around, and feel<br />There is a blessing wanting;<br />Too soon our hearts the truth reveal,<br />That joy is disenchanting."</span> And again - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"When amid the world's delights,<br />How warm soe'er we feel a moment among them -<br />We find ourselves, when the hot blast hath blown,<br />Prostrate, and weak, and wretched."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"He who observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap." The proverb is not to be understood literally, but in the spirit of the whole paraenesis: it is not directed against the provident observation, guided by experience, of the monitions and warnings lying in the present condition of the weather, but against that useless, because impossible, calculation of the coming state of the weather, which waits on from day to day, from week to week, till the right time for sowing and reaping has passed away. The seed-time requires rain so as to open up and moisten the ground; he who has too much hesitation observes (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;) the wind whether it will bring rain (<a href="/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>), and on that account puts off the sowing of the seed till it is too late. The time of harvest requires warmth without rain (<a href="/proverbs/26-1.htm">Proverbs 26:1</a>); but the scrupulous and timid man, who can never be sure enough, looks at the clouds (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a>), scents rainy weather, and finds now and never any security for the right weather for the gathering in of the fruits of the field. He who would accomplish and gain anything, must have confidence and courage to venture something; the conditions of success cannot be wholly reckoned upon, the future is in the hand of God, the All-Conditioning. </body></html>
