Give freely, though it may seem thrown away and lost. Give to many. Excuse not thyself with the good thou hast done, from the good thou hast further to do. It is not lost, but well laid out. We have reason to expect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in the day of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefit others. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where the providence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work to do, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every little difficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never go on, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulation are, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree with his word, whether we see it or not.

If indeed a man could foresee and be assured of seasonable weather for sowing and reaping, or a proper opportunity for doing good, all circumstances agreeing, it would be right to wait for it, and take it; but as these things are not in our power, nor within the compass of our knowledge, we should take the first opportunity of doing good, and leave the issue to divine Providence: as in many things in nature we are and should be content to be ignorant of them, and leave them with God, who brings them about by his secret power and providence: as, for instance, we know not "the way of the spirit", or "of the wind" (r), as some render it; from whence it comes and whither it goes, where and when it will subside, or what wind will blow next; or of the spirit or soul of man, how it enters into the body. So the Targum, <p>"how the spirit of the breath of life goes into the body of an infant:'' <p>whether it is by traduction, as some, which is not likely; or by transfusion, or by creation out of nothing, or by formation out of something pre-existent, and by an immediate infusion of it: or, "what is the way of the breath"; of the breath of a child in the womb, whether it breathes or not; if it does, how? if not, how does it live? or what is the way of the soul out of the body, how it goes out of it when the body dies; <p>nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; or is "full", pregnant, big with child: or "in the womb that is full" (s); full of liquids, and yet bones are separated from them, grow out of them, and in them, and are hardened; all which how it should be is unknown: "bones" are mentioned because they are the more solid and substantial parts of the body, the basis and strength of it; and because it may seem more difficult how any part of the seed should harden into them, while other parts are converted into skin and flesh; <p>even so thou knowest not the works of God, who maketh all; the Targum adds, in wisdom; as men are ignorant of many of the works of nature, so of those of Providence, especially which are future; as whether men shall be rich or poor, have days of prosperity or adversity; what their latter end will be, whether they shall not stand in need of the assistance of others, it may be of them or theirs to whom they now give; or what will be the issue of present acts of beneficence and liberality; these, with many other things of the like kind, should be left with God. Some understand this of the work of grace and conversion, which is a secret and difficult work, only wrought by the power and grace of God; and may be begun, or shortly will, in a poor person, judged an unworthy object of charity for supposed want of it, a thing unknown. <p>(r) "venti", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Drusius, Mercerus, Amama, Cocceius, Gejerus, Rambachius; so Broughton, and the Syriac and Arabic versions.

Two different examples of man’s ignorance of the processes of the common phenomena of nature are adduced on this view as analogous to his ignorance of the “work of God,” of what we call the Divine Government of the Universe. It may be questioned however whether, both here and in <a href="/john/3-8.htm" title="The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.">John 3:8</a>, a more adequate meaning is not given by retaining the idea of “spirit” as the “breath of life” of <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>. The growth of the human embryo was for the early observers of nature an impenetrable mystery (<a href="/job/10-11.htm" title="You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and have fenced me with bones and sinews.">Job 10:11</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/139-13.htm" title="For you have possessed my reins: you have covered me in my mother's womb....">Psalm 139:13-17</a>). It became yet more mysterious when men thought of life, with all its phenomena of sensation and consciousness entering into the material structure thus “fearfully and wonderfully made.” This sense of the word agrees it will be seen, with its use in chaps. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm" title="Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" title="Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>. The word “nor” has nothing answering to it in the Hebrew and the sentence should run thus, describing not two distinct phenomena but one complex fact, “<span class="bld">as thou knowest not the way of the spirit</span> (the breath of life) <span class="bld">how the framework of the body</span> (literally <span class="bld">the bones</span>, but the word is used commonly for the whole body as in <a href="/lamentations/4-7.htm" title="Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:">Lamentations 4:7</a>; <a href="/job/7-15.htm" title="So that my soul chooses strangling, and death rather than my life.">Job 7:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm" title="The light of the eyes rejoices the heart: and a good report makes the bones fat.">Proverbs 15:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm" title="Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.">Proverbs 16:24</a> and elsewhere) <span class="bld">is in the womb of her that is with child.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the works of God who maketh all</span>] So in ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm" title="Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>, we had “Consider the work of God.” Here the addition of “who maketh all” indicates a higher stage of faith. That “never-failing Providence orders all things both in heaven and earth.” The agnosticism of the <span class="bld">Debater</span> is, like that of Hooker (<span class="ital">Eccl. Pol.</span> i. 2. § 3), the utterance of a devout Theism, content to keep within the limits of the Knowable, but not placing the object of its adoration in the category of the Unknown and Unknowable.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit.</span> In this verse are presented one or two examples of man's ignorance of natural facts and processes as analogous to the mysteries of God's moral government. The word translated "spirit" (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) may mean also "wind," and is so taken here by many commentators (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; and comp. <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). In this view there would be two instances given, viz. the wind and the embryo. Certainly, the mention of the wind seems to come naturally after what has preceded; and man's ignorance of its way, and powerlessness to control it, are emblematic of his attitude towards Divine providence. The versions, however, seem to support the rendering of the Authorized Version. Thus the Septuagint (which connects the clause with ver. 4), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> ("among whom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who watch the weather), "There is none that knoweth what is the way of the spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate. <span class="accented">Quomodo ignoras quae sit via spiritus</span>. If we take this view, we have only one idea in the verse, and that is the infusion of the breath of life in the embryo, and its growth in its mother's womb. <span class="cmt_word">Nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child</span>. Our version, by its insertions, has made two facts out of the statement in the Hebrew, which is literally, <span class="accented">holy the bones</span> (are) <span class="accented">in the womb of a pregnant woman</span>. Septuagint, "As (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>) bones are in the womb," etc.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et qua ratione compingantur ossa in ventre praegnantis, "</span> And in what way the bones are framed in the womb of the pregnant." The formation and quickening of the foetus were always regarded as mysterious and inscrutable (comp. <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8, 9</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>; Wisd. 7:1, etc.). Wright compares M. Aurelius, 10:26, "The first principles of life are extremely slender and mysterious; and yet nature works them up into a strange increase of bulk, diversity, and proportion." Controversies concerning the origin of the soul have been rife from early times, some holding what is called Traducianism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that soul and body are both derived by propagation from earthly parents; others supporting Creationism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the soul, created specially by God, is infused into the child before birth. St. Augustine confesses ('Op. Imperf.,' 4:104) that he is unable to determine the truth of either opinion. And, indeed, this is one of those secret things which Holy Scripture has not decided for us, and about which no authoritative sentence has been given. The term "bones" is used for the whole conformation of the body (comp. <a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>); <span class="accented">meleah</span>, "pregnant," means literally, "full," and is used like the Latin <span class="accented">plena</span> can here and nowhere else in the Old Testament, though common in later Hebrew. Thus Ovid, 'Metam.,' 10:469 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Plena patris thalamis excedit, et impia dire<br />Semina fert utero."</span> And 'Fast.,' 4:633 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nunc gravidum pecus est; gravidae sunt semine terrae<br />Telluri plenae victima plena datur."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</span> Equally mysterious in its general scope and in its details is the working of God's providence. And as everything lies in God's hands, it must needs be secret and beyond human ken. This is why to "the works of God" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>) is added, "who maketh all." The God of nature is Lord of the future (comp. <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; Ecclus. 18:6); man must not disquiet himself about this. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Meals they make into a pleasure, and wine cheereth the life, and money maketh everything serviceable."

The subject which 'osim bears in itself ( equals  'osim he&#772;m) might be syntactically definite, as e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-5.htm">Psalm 33:5</a>, &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, He, Jahve, loves, thus: those princes, or, from <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:18</a> : such slothful men; but 'osim is better rendered, like e.g., omrim, <a href="/exodus/5-16.htm">Exodus 5:16</a> (Ewald, 200a), and as in the Mishna we read &#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; and the like with gramm. indefin. subj.: they make, but so that by it the slothful just designated, and those of a princely rank are meant (cf. a similar use of the inf. abs., as here of the part. in the historical style, <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). Ginsburg's rendering is altogether at fault: "They turn bread and wine which cheereth life into revelry." If &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; as its object stand together, the meaning is, "to prepare a feast," <a href="/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>; cf. 'avad lehe&#772;m, <a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1</a>. Here, as there, 'osim le&#780;he&#780;m signifies coenam faciunt (parant). The &#1500; of &#1500;&#1513;&#1474; is not the sign of the factitive obj. (as lee&#772;l, <a href="/isaiah/44-17.htm">Isaiah 44:17</a>), and thus not, as Hitz. supposes, the conditioning &#1500; with which adv. conceptions are formed, - e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-5.htm">Lamentations 4:5</a>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1498; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;, where Jerome rightly translates, voluptuose (vid., E. Gerlach, l.c.), - but, which is most natural and is very appropriate, it is the &#1500; of the aim or purpose: non ad debitam corporis refectionem, sed ad hera ludicra et stulta gaudia (Geier). &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; is laughter, as that to which he utters the sentence (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:2</a>): Thou art mad. It is incorrect, moreover, to take le&#780;he&#780;m veyaim together, and to render yesammahh hayaim as an attribut. clause to yain: this epitheton ornans of wine would here be a most unsuitable weakening of the figure intended. It is only an apparent reason for this, that what <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> says in praise of wine the author cannot here turn into a denunciatory reproach. Wine is certainly fitted to make glad the heart of a man; but here the subject of discourse is duty-forgetting idlers, to whom chiefly wine must be brought (<a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>) to cheer their life (this sluggard-life spent in feasting and revelry). The fut. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1468;&#1495; is meant in the same modal sense as &#1497;&#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a>: wine must accomplish that for them. And they can feast and drink, for they have money, and money &#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;... &#1497;&#1506;. Luther hits the meaning: "Money must procure everything for them;" but the clause is too general; and better thus, after Jerome, the Zrich Bible: "unto money are all things obedient." The old Jewish interpreters compare <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>., where &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, with accus. petentis, signifies, "to answer a request, to gratify a desire." But in the passage before us &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is not the obj. accus. of petentis, but petiti; for 'anah is connected with the accus. of that to which one answers as well as of that which one answers, e.g., <a href="//biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>, cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>. It is unnecessary, with Hitzig, to interpret &#1497;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; as Hiph.: Money makes all to hear (him who has the money), - makes it that nothing is refused to his wish. It is the Kal: Money answers to every demand, hears every wish, grants whatever one longs for, helps to all; as Menander says: "Silver and gold, - these are, according to my opinion, the most useful gods; if these have a place in the house, wish what thou wilt (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), all will be thine;" and Horace, Epod. i. 6. 36 s.:<p>"Scilicet uxorem cum dote fidemque et amicos<p>Et genus et formam regina pecunia donat."<p>The author has now described the king who is a misfortune and him who is a blessing to the land, and princes as they ought to be and as they ought not to be, but particularly luxurious idle courtiers; there is now a warning given which has for its motive not only prudence, but also, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>, religiousness. </body></html>
