Here is a caution to think of death, even when life is most sweet. Solomon makes an effecting address to young persons. They would desire opportunity to pursue every pleasure. Then follow your desires, but be assured that God will call you into judgment. How many give loose to every appetite, and rush into every vicious pleasure! But God registers every one of their sinful thoughts and desires, their idle words and wicked words. If they would avoid remorse and terror, if they would have hope and comfort on a dying bed, if they would escape misery here and hereafter, let them remember the vanity of youthful pleasures. That Solomon means to condemn the pleasures of sin is evident. His object is to draw the young to purer and more lasting joys. This is not the language of one grudging youthful pleasures, because he can no longer partake of them; but of one who has, by a miracle of mercy, been brought back in safety. He would persuade the young from trying a course whence so few return. If the young would live a life of true happiness, if they would secure happiness hereafter, let them remember their Creator in the days of their youth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The preceding exhortation to a life of labor in the sight of God is now addressed especially to the active and the young; and is enforced by another consideration, namely, the transitory character of all that sustains youth.<p><a href="/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a><p>The light ... the sun - Gifts of God which cheer man's toil, but which he almost ceases to appreciate in his old age.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. light&#8212;of life (Ec 7:11; Ps 49:19).

Here begins a new subject, as most think; and some here begin the twelfth and last chapter, and not improperly. This is true of natural light, which is exceeding pleasant, useful, and beneficial; by which men discern objects, behold the things of nature with pleasure, walk in the way without stumbling, and do the work and business of life: and also of civil light or prosperity; for, as afflictions are expressed by darkness, and adversity by night; so the comforts and good things of life by light and day, which are very desirable and delectable: and here "life" itself may be meant, for light is sometimes put for life, which is the light of the living; and what sweeter and more desirable than that, especially a life attended with prosperity and peace? see <a href="/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28</a>. The Targum and Jarchi interpret it of the light of the law; and which is indeed a light, and so is the whole word of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a>, <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>; but may be better applied unto the Gospel, which is a great and glorious light, <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; and a means of enlightening dark minds; not only of showing men their sinfulness, as the law does; but the insufficiency of their righteousness, of all their own goodness and good works to justify; it reveals Christ, and the glories of his person; it sets him forth evidently, as crucified and slain, for the worst of sinners; it makes manifest his fulness, ability, and willingness, as a Saviour; righteousness, peace, pardon, and salvation by him; it makes known things not to be discerned by the light of nature, even things wonderful and marvellous, as well as what is the way a man should walk in: and this light is sweet and pleasant, not to a blind and carnal man, who despises it, and reckons it foolishness, but to those who are enlightened by the Spirit of God; and to these it is very delightful, even to all their senses; it is sweet to their taste, a joyful sound to their ears, and beautiful to their sight are the feet of them that bring its good tidings. The light of grace, which appears in first conversion, and comes from God suddenly, which at first is small, but increases, is exceeding pleasant, strikes the soul with delight and wonder; it is marvellous light, <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; and so is the light of joy and gladness to believers, when it arises to them after a time of darkness, or the light of God's countenance, <a href="/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>; and such will be the light of the latter day glory, and more especially the light of the heavenly state; <p>and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun; the natural sun, shining at noon day, which is a luminous and glorious body, communicating light and heat to all the world: which is so glorious and so pleasant to behold, that Anaxagoras, the philosopher, being asked what he was born for, answered, <p>"to see the heavens, the sun, and the moon (t);'' <p>and Eudoxus, another philosopher, said, <p>"he could be content to perish, could he get so near to the sun as to learn the nature of it (u).'' <p>To "see the sun", in the language of this book, is to live in this world, and to enjoy the light of the sun, and the comforts of life; see <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>; and now a life, attended with outward prosperity and inward peace, that is spent in doing and enjoying good, is a very desirable and delightful one; though such a man should not think of living always, but of death, and the days of darkness, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:8</a>. This may he applied to Christ, the sun of righteousness, <a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; the fountain of all spiritual light and heat; the brightness of his Father's glory; and who is superior to angels and men; and is to be beheld by faith, and in his own light, as the sun is; and whom to look upon with an eye of faith is exceeding pleasant and delightful, and fills with joy unspeakable and full of glory, <a href="/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>. <p>(t) Laert. in Vita Anaxag. p. 95.

The word for “sweet” is that used of honey in <a href="/judges/14-14.htm" title="And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.">Jdg 14:14</a>; of the honeycomb in <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm" title="My son, eat you honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to your taste:">Proverbs 24:13</a>. The pessimism of the thinker is passing away under the sunshine of the wiser plan of life in which he al last finds guidance. Life may after all, rightly ordered, be pleasant and comely, not without the “sweetness and light” on which the modern preachers of wisdom lay stress. A remarkable parallel to the form of the maxim (quoted by Ginsburg) is found in Euripides:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Μή μ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἀπολέσης ἄωρον</span>• <span class="greekheb">ἡδὺ γὰρ τὸ φῶς</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λεύσσειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ γῆν μὴ μ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἰδεῖν ἀναγκάσῃς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“Destroy me not before my youth is ripe:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For pleasant sure it is to see the sun;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Compel me not to see what lies below.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Iphig. in Aul.</span> 1219.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So Theognis contemplating death:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κείσομαι ὥστε λίθος</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄφθογγος</span>, <span class="greekheb">λείψω δ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἐρατὸν φάος ἠελίοιο</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"></span>“Then shall I lie, as voiceless as a stone,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And see no more the loved light of the sun.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The use of the phrase “seeing the sun” for living, may be noted as essentially Hellenic in its tone.

Do not be perplexed, or despondent, or paralyzed in your work, by the difficulties that meet you. Confront them with a cheerful mien, and enjoy life while it lasts. "The light" may be taken literally, or as equivalent to life. The very light, with all that it unfolds, all that it beautifies, all that it quickens, is a pleasure; life is worth living, and affords high and merited enjoyment to the faithful worker.

Most interpreters, chiefly the Talm., Midrash, and Targ., <p>(Note: The Midrash tells the following story: Rabbi Akiba sees a ship wrecked which carried in it one learned in the law. He finds him again actively engaged in Cappadocia. What whale, he asked him, has vomited thee out upon dry land? How hast thou merited this? The scribe learned in the law thereupon related that when he went on board the ship, he gave a loaf of bread to a poor man, who thanked him for it, saying: As thou hast saved my life, may thy life be saved. Thereupon Akiba thought of the proverb in <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a>. Similarly the Targ.: Extend to the poor the bread for thy support; they sail in ships over the water.)<p>regard this as an exhortation to charity, which although practised without expectation of reward, does not yet remain unrewarded at last. An Aram. proverb of Ben Sira's (vid., Buxtorf's Florilegium, p. 171) proceeds on this interpretation: "Scatter thy bread on the water and on the dry land; in the end of the days thou findest it again." Knobel quotes a similar Arab. proverb from Diez' Denkwrdigkeiten von Asien (Souvenirs of Asia), II:106: "Do good; cast thy bread into the water: thou shalt be repaid some day." See also the proverb in Goethe's Westst. Divan, compared by Herzfeld. Voltaire, in his Prcis de l'Ecclsiaste en vers, also adopts this rendering:<p>Repandez vos bien faits avec magnificence,<p>Mme aux moins vertueux ne les refusez pas.<p>Ne vous informez pas de leur reconnaissance - <p>Il est grand, il est beau de faire des ingrats.<p>That instead of "into the water (the sea)" of these or similar proverbs, Koheleth uses here the expression, "on the face of (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) the waters," makes no difference: Eastern bread has for the most part the form of cakes, and is thin (especially such as is prepared hastily for guests, 'ughoth or matstsoth, <a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-3.htm">Genesis 19:3</a>); so that when thrown into the water, it remains on the surface (like a chip of wood, <a href="/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>), and is carried away by the stream. But &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, with this reference of the proverb to beneficence, is strange; instead of it, the word &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1498; was rather to be expected; the lxx renders by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; the Syr., shadar; Jerome, mitte; Venet. &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;; thus by none is the pure idea of casting forth connected with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;. And the reason given does not harmonize with this reference: "for in the course of many days (berov yamin, cf. me&#772;rov yamim, <a href="/isaiah/24-22.htm">Isaiah 24:22</a>) wilt thou find it" (not "find it again," which would be expressed by &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;). This indefinite designation of time, which yet definitely points to the remote future, does not thus indicate that the subject is the recompense of noble self-renunciation which is sooner or later rewarded, and often immediately, but exactly accords with the idea of commerce carried on with foreign countries, which expects to attain its object only after a long period of waiting. In the proper sense, they send their bread over the surface of the water who, as <a href="/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a> expresses, "do business in great waters." It is a figure taken from the corn trade of a seaport, an illustration of the thought: seek thy support in the way of bold, confident adventure.<p>(Note: The Greek phrase &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, "to sow the sea"  equals  to undertake a fruitless work, is of an altogether different character; cf. <a href="/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>.)<p>Bread in &#1500;&#1495; is the designation of the means of making a living or gain, and bread in &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; the designation of the gain (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>). Hitzig's explanation: Throw thy bread into the water  equals  venture thy hope, is forced; and of the same character are all the attempts to understand the word of agricultural pursuits; e.g., by van der Palm: sementem fac muxta aquas (or: in loca irrigua); Grtz even translates: "Throw thy corn on the surface of the water," and understands this, with the fancy of a Martial, of begetting children. Mendelssohn is right in remarking that the exhortation shows itself to be that of Koheleth-Solomon, whose ships traded to Tarshish and Ophir. Only the reference to self-sacrificing beneficence stands on a level with it as worthy of consideration.
