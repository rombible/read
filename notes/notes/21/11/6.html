Give freely, though it may seem thrown away and lost. Give to many. Excuse not thyself with the good thou hast done, from the good thou hast further to do. It is not lost, but well laid out. We have reason to expect evil, for we are born to trouble; it is wisdom to do good in the day of prosperity. Riches cannot profit us, if we do not benefit others. Every man must labour to be a blessing to that place where the providence of God casts him. Wherever we are, we may find good work to do, if we have but hearts to do it. If we magnify every little difficulty, start objections, and fancy hardships, we shall never go on, much less go through with our work. Winds and clouds of tribulation are, in God's hands, designed to try us. God's work shall agree with his word, whether we see it or not. And we may well trust God to provide for us, without our anxious, disquieting cares.

It has been held to mean (1) that men are to seek sensual pleasures not in the morning of their youth only, but in the eventide of age, not to be afraid of begetting children, in or out of wedlock, in any period of their life; or (2) that man is to work, as we say, early and late, doing his appointed task, regardless of the chances of life; or (3) with a more specific application of the same general principle, that he is to sow the seed of good and kindly deeds, and wait for the harvest, the prospect of which is hidden from him. Of these (3) seems every way the truest and most satisfying interpretation. In “withdraw not thy hand,” and in the use of the two demonstrative pronouns (in the Hebrew, however, the same pronoun is repeated, <span class="bld">this or this</span>), we have a parallel to the thought and language of ch. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm" title="It is good that you should take hold of this; yes, also from this withdraw not your hand: for he that fears God shall come forth of them all.">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a>. The whole precept is a call to activity in good, not unlike that of Him who said “I must work the works of Him that sent me, while it is called to day: the night cometh, when no man can work” (<a href="/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>); who taught men to labour in the vineyard, even though they were not called to begin their work till the eleventh hour when it was “toward evening, and the day far spent” (<a href="/context/matthew/20-1.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard....">Matthew 20:1-16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou knowest not whether shall prosper</span>] The ignorance of men as to the results of their labour, still more the apparent or the actual failure of their earlier efforts, tempts them too often to despondency and indolence. The maxim, like that of <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm" title="In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a>, bids them take comfort from that very ignorance. The seed sown in the morning of life may bear its harvest at once, or not till the evening of age. The man may reap at one and the same time the fruits of his earlier and his later sowing, and may find that “both are alike good.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the morning sow thy seed</span>. Do not let your ignorance of the future and the inscrutability of God's dealings lead you to indolence and apathy; do your appointed work; be active and diligent in your calling. The labor of the farmer is taken as a type of business generally, and was especially appropriate to the class of persons whom Koheleth is instructing. The injunction occurs naturally after ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">And in the evening withhold not thine hand.</span> Labor on untiredly from morn till evening. It is not an advice to rest during midday, as that was too hot a time to work (Stuart), but a call to spend the entire day in active employment, the two extremities being mentioned in order to include the whole. Work undertaken in a right spirit is a blessing, not a curse, shuts out many temptations, encourages many virtues. Some see here a  special reference to the maxim at the beginning of the chapter, as though the author meant, "Exercise thy charity at all times, early and late," the metaphor being similar 'to that in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>, "He which soweth sparingly," etc. Others find a figure of the ages of, man in the "morning and evening," thus, "From earliest youth practice piety and purity, and continue such conduct to its close." This leads naturally to the subject of the following section; but it may be doubted whether this thought was in the author's mind. It seems best to take the paragraph merely as commending activity, whether in business or in benevolence, without anxious regard to results which are in higher hands. "Withhold not thy hand," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from sowing; <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">For thou knowest not whether shall prosper</span>, which of the two sewings, <span class="cmt_word">either this or that</span>, the morning or evening sowing. It is a chance, and a man must risk something; if one fails, the other may succeed. <span class="cmt_word">Or whether they both shall be alike good</span>. The uncertainty rouses to exertion; labor may at any rate secure half the crop, or even give a double produce, if both sewings succeed. So in religion and morality, the good seed sown early and late may bear fruit early or late, or may have blessed results all along. The Vulgate is less correct, <span class="accented">Et si utrumque simul, melius</span> or, "And if both together, it will be better." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Curse not the king even in thy thought; and in thy bed-chamber curse not the rich; for the birds of the air carry away the sound, and the winged creature telleth the matter."

As to its meaning, it is the same as the proverb quoted by the Midrash: "walls have ears." <p>(Note: Vid., Tendlau's Sprichwrter, No. 861.)<p>Geier thinks of the swallows which helped to the discovery of Bessus, the murderer of his father, and the cranes which betrayed the murderer of Ibycus, as comparisons approaching that which is here said. There would certainly be no hyperbole if the author thought of carrier-pigeons (Paxton, Kitto) in the service of espionage. But the reason for the warning is hyperbolical, like an hundred others in all languages:<p>"Aures fert paries, oculos nemus: ergo cavere<p>Debet qui loquitur, ne possint verba nocere." </body></html>
