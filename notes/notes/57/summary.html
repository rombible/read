This should be done for two reasons:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> For Jesus’ sake! Onesimus had just been led to Christ by Paul.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> For Paul’s sake! The apostle and Philemon had been friends for many years.<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> For Philemon’s sake!

This relentless enemy of Christians (Acts 8:3; 22:5, 19; 26:11; Gal. 1:13) would, following his conversion (Acts 9:3-9), become the greatest missionary, church planter, soul winner, and theologian in church history, authoring nearly half of the New Testament books!<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

God had used law, history, poetry, prophecy, and the Gospels heretofore, but in the Epistles He adopted a more personal and direct method. In this intimate way, He looks back to the cross and talks about the church. Someone has said that the Epistles are the love letters of Christ to us. Dr. Deissman divided them into two classifications: epistles and letters. The epistles are general, while the letters are more personal and individual. Under this division, the Epistle of Philemon would be classified as a letter, for it is individual and intimate. There is reason to believe that Paul did not expect its contents to be divulged (at other times he knew that he was writing scripture). This does not detract from the inspiration and value of Philemon, but rather enhances its value and message” (<i>Through the Bible,</i> p. 211).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> The historical background of Philemon is as follows:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Onesimus, a slave owned by Philemon (wealthy Colossian believer and long-time friend of Paul) had robbed his master and run away to Rome.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In some wonderful way, Onesimus’ path crosses that of Paul, resulting in his glorious conversion to Christ.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Upon hearing his testimony, Paul determines to send him back to Philemon.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> To prepare the way (for what could be a very tense meeting), Paul pens this beautiful letter to Philemon.
