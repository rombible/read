Such changed characters often become a blessing to all among whom they reside. Christianity does not do away our duties to others, but directs to the right doing of them. True penitents will be open in owning their faults, as doubtless Onesimus had been to Paul, upon his being awakened and brought to repentance; especially in cases of injury done to others. The communion of saints does not destroy distinction of property. This passage is an instance of that being imputed to one, which is contracted by another; and of one becoming answerable for another, by a voluntary engagement, that he might be freed from the punishment due to his crimes, according to the doctrine that Christ of his own will bore the punishment of our sins, that we might receive the reward of his righteousness. Philemon was Paul's son in the faith, yet he entreated him as a brother. Onesimus was a poor slave, yet Paul besought for him as if seeking some great thing for himself. Christians should do what may give joy to the hearts of one another. From the world they expect trouble; they should find comfort and joy in one another. When any of our mercies are taken away, our trust and hope must be in God. We must diligently use the means, and if no other should be at hand, abound in prayer. Yet, though prayer prevails, it does not merit the things obtained. And if Christians do not meet on earth, still the grace of the Lord Jesus will be with their spirits, and they will soon meet before the throne to join for ever in admiring the riches of redeeming love. The example of Onesimus may encourage the vilest sinners to return to God, but it is shamefully prevented, if any are made bold thereby to persist in evil courses. Are not many taken away in their sins, while others become more hardened? Resist not present convictions, lest they return no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But withal - Or, at the same time -  &#x391;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  Hama.

He hopes to visit Colossæ<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">But withal</span>] Here is a different matter, yet not quite apart from the main theme. “There is a gentle compulsion in this mention of a personal visit to Colossæ. The Apostle would be able to see for himself that Philemon had not disappointed his expectations” (Lightfoot). And more; would not the joy of the prospect make “obedience” on Philemon’s part doubly willing?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">prepare</span>] The verb is in the singular.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a lodging</span>] The Greek may mean either “<span class="ital">lodging</span>” or <span class="bld">hospitality</span>. General Greek usage is in favour of the latter. The “<span class="ital">hospitality</span>” would no doubt be gladly provided in Philemon’s own house; but St Paul, with his unfailing courtesy, does not <span class="ital">ask</span> this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I trust</span>] <span class="bld">I hope</span>. He makes no prophecy, where none is authorized. Even when (as <a href="/romans/15-24.htm" title="Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.">Romans 15:24</a>; <a href="/romans/15-28.htm" title="When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.">Romans 15:28</a>) he speaks positively of his plans, it is with an evident reservation of “if the Lord will.” The prospect of Romans 15 had by this time been much modified.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through your prayers</span>] which “move the hand of God,” being all the while part of His chain of means. For St Paul’s estimate of the power of intercessory prayer see e.g. <a href="/context/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;...">Romans 15:30-32</a> (a close parallel); a Cor. <a href="/philemon/1-11.htm" title="Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:">Philemon 1:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>.—Neither for him nor for the Colossians did the deep peace of self-resignation mean Stoic apathy, nor, surely, even the “indifference” of the Mystics.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I shall be given unto you</span>] With a noble <span class="ital">naïveté</span> he recognizes his own dearness in the eyes of his converts; he does not affect to think that his return would not be “<span class="ital">a gift</span>” to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lightfoot cites <a href="/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="/acts/25-11.htm" title="For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them.

There was this one additional inducement that could be brought to bear upon the mind of Philemon, viz. the expectation of speedily seeing him in person, and this, in conclusion, he uses. "I do not think that the apostle was so rich or encumbered with such great packages that he needed a lodging prepared beforehand, and was not content with a narrow dwelling-place, but thought the most spacious houses scanty for the accommodation of his small body; but that, while Philemon was expecting [the apostle] to come to him, he would the more do what he had requested" (Jerome). Meyer makes much of the improbability that St. Paul, starting from Rome, should bespeak a lodging in Colossae. Yet he suggests that it was  perfectly natural that, starting from <span class="accented">Caesarea</span>, the apostle should take <span class="accented">Colossae</span> on the road to Rome. But the one seems almost as probable as the other. The apostle, on his release, had, so far as we know, no definite plans; the cities of Asia Minor were familiar to him, and he would naturally prepare to go wherever the first pressing occasion, that of Onesimus, called him.
