St. Paul declares his special joy to have been that “the bowels (<span class= "ital">i.e., the hearts</span>) of the saints, have been refreshed through thee.” The word “refresh” is the very word used by our Lord in His gracious promise: “Come unto me all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I will <span class= "ital">refresh you</span>” (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28</a>). It is ultimately in Him that the hearts of the saints are refreshed. But in this case it was through the instrumentality of Philemon, by “the communion of faith,” to which his active love was the means of welcoming them, and in which they had fellowship in Christ, both with the Father and with His children. (Comp. <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a>.) St. Paul uses the word “refresh” not unfrequently to express the relief and rest given by Christian fellowship on earth. (See below, <a href="/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a>; and comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/16-18.htm" title="For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge you them that are such.">1Corinthians 16:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2Corinthians 7:13</a>.) We find it in the Apocalypse applied to the rest with Christ in heaven (<a href="/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Brother.</span>—The name is given to Philemon here and in <a href="/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a> with a marked emphasis of affection, evidently implying some special intimacy of friendship, not apparently at Colossæ (for see <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>); but perhaps at Ephesus, during St. Paul’s long stay there. Probably Philemon (whose son Archippus is supposed to have been) was St. Paul’s equal in age, and although actually his convert is not addressed (as usual) as his “son in the faith.” In this place, moreover, the title “brother” has a peculiar appropriateness: for the Apostle has been speaking of the love of Philemon, which made him a brother indeed to all in the family of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/philemon/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">For we have great joy and consolation </span>— Timothy and I are greatly rejoiced and comforted; <span class="ital">in, </span>or by, <span class="ital">thy love </span>— To God and his people; <span class="ital">because the bowels of the saints </span>— That is, the saints themselves, to whom it seems Philemon’s house was open; <span class="ital">are refreshed by thee, brother </span>— So the apostle terms him; not merely because he was a believer in Christ, but because he was one whom he tenderly loved. “The <span class="ital">refreshment </span>of which the apostle speaks was produced by the relief which Philemon’s works of charity brought to them in their distresses. And the saints who were thus refreshed were not those only who lived in Philemon’s neighbourhood, but those also who were driven from their homes for the name of Christ, or who went about preaching the gospel. Perhaps also the apostle meant that the knowledge of Philemon’s charitable actions gave great joy even to the saints who had no need of his good offices.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need, bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God. Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more and more, to God's honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love - In thy love toward Christians.
