Grace is the best wish for ourselves and others; with this the apostle begins and ends. All grace is from Christ; he purchased, and he bestows it. What need we more to make us happy, than to have the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with our spirit? Let us do that now, which we should do at the last breath. Then men are ready to renounce the world, and to prefer the least portion of grace and faith before a kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Lucas - see the notes at the Epistle to the Colossians, <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philemon/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

However, he is not mentioned as a prisoner in Col 4:12, so that "fellow prisoner" here may mean merely one who was a faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society put himself in the position of a prisoner. So also "Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner," Col 4:10, may mean.

Marcus was Barnabas's sister's son, the son of that Mary, in whose house the church met, and prayed for Peter when in prison; whose name was John Mark, whom Saul and Barnabas took along with them to Antioch, and from thence, in their travels, to other parts; but he leaving them at Pamphylia, was the occasion of a contention between Saul and Barnabas afterwards, when returned to Antioch; the latter insisting on his going with them again, and the former refusing it on account of his departure from them; which contention rose so high that they parted upon it, <a href="/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a> though after this the apostle was reconciled to him; he approving himself to be a faithful and useful minister of the Gospel; and therefore he desires Timothy to bring him along with him, <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a> and if this epistle was written after that, he was now come to him; however, he was now with him, whether before or after: Aristarchus was a Macedonian of Thessalonica; or very likely the apostle had been the instrument of converting him there, and who followed him from thence, and attended him wherever he went; he was with him in the uproar raised by Demetrius at Ephesus, and accompanied him into Asia; went with him in his voyage to Rome, and was now a fellow prisoner there, <a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>. Demas is the same with him who is mentioned in <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a> and if this epistle is later than that, it should seem that he was restored from his fall, and was returned to the apostle. Lucas is the same with Luke the Evangelist, the beloved physician, the brother whose praise was in all the churches, and a constant companion of the apostle, in his travels; and who wrote the book called, "The Acts of the Apostles": these the apostle styles, "my fellow labourers", being all ministers of the Gospel; and this shows the apostle's great humility, so to call them, when they were far from being on an equal foot with him in office, gifts, or usefulness: and the Christian salutations of these persons are sent to Philemon, with this view, to engage him the more to attend to the apostle's request, in which they all joined. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philemon/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philemon/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μάρκος</span>: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, John Mark, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>; <a href="/acts/15-37.htm" title="And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 15:37</a>, <a href="/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>; he and Aristarchus were Jewish-Christians (<a href="/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.
