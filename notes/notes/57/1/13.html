The verb in the first clause is “to wish;” in the second “to will.” The tense in the first clause is the imperfect: “I was wishing,” or “prepared to wish” (just as in <a href="/acts/25-22.htm" title="Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, you shall hear him.">Acts 25:22</a>; and, in the case of a cognate verb, <a href="/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>), implying, perhaps, a suppressed condition; in the second it is the past definite: “I willed,” or “determined” finally.<p><span class= "bld">In thy stead.</span>—Here, again, there is a certain delicacy of suggestion. A slave was his master’s property; he could act only on his master’s behalf and by his consent. St. Paul is sure that Philemon’s love for him would have gladly given that consent, and so made Onesimus an instrument of willing service to St. Paul.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-14 It does not lower any one to condescend, and sometimes even to beseech, where, in strictness of right, we might command: the apostle argues from love, rather than authority, in behalf of one converted through his means; and this was Onesimus. In allusion to that name, which signifies profitable, the apostle allows that in time past he had been unprofitable to Philemon, but hastens to mention the change by which he had become profitable. Unholy persons are unprofitable; they answer not the great end of their being. But what happy changes conversion makes! of evil, good; of unprofitable, useful. Religious servants are treasures in a family. Such will make conscience of their time and trusts, and manage all they can for the best. No prospect of usefulness should lead any to neglect their obligations, or to fail in obedience to superiors. One great evidence of true repentance consists in returning to practise the duties which have been neglected. In his unconverted state, Onesimus had withdrawn, to his master's injury; but now he had seen his sin and repented, he was willing and desirous to return to his duty. Little do men know for what purposes the Lord leaves some to change their situations, or engage in undertakings, perhaps from evil motives. Had not the Lord overruled some of our ungodly projects, we may reflect upon cases, in which our destruction must have been sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead - "That he might render me the service which I know you would if you were here."

At Rome, where the apostle was a prisoner: <p>that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the Gospel; the apostle was in bonds, not for any crime, for any immorality he had been guilty of, but for the sake of the Gospel, for professing and preaching that; for this he was an ambassador in bonds, as he elsewhere says, <a href="/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>. Now he would have kept Onesimus with him, either to have waited upon him, in his bonds, and to have provided for him the necessaries of life; or to have assisted him in the ministration of the word, in the room of Philemon, who, had he been there, would have been employed in such service; so that if the apostle had retained him, he would have been acting not for himself, but in the room of his master, and doing what he should have done, had he been on the spot. This the apostle observes to prevent an objection that might have been made; that since Onesimus was become so profitable to him, why did he send him back? why did he not keep him for his own service? this he obviates and removes, by signifying he should have done it, but for the following reason. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philemon/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philemon/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philemon/1-13.htm" title="Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:">Philemon 1:13</a> f <span class="greekheb">Ἐγώ</span>] I for my part.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐβουλόμην</span>] <span class="ital">I was of the mind</span>.

The apostle formerly cherished the design and the wish (imperfect <span class="greekheb">ἐβουλ</span>.) of retaining Onesimus with himself, instead of sending him back to Philemon, but has become of the mind (historical aorist <span class="greekheb">ἠθέλησα</span>), etc. Thus <span class="greekheb">ἠθέλ</span>. denotes that which <span class="ital">supervened</span> on the previous occurrence of the <span class="greekheb">ἐβουλ</span>., and hindered the realization of the latter.

Comp. Hofmann. This mode of regarding and representing the <span class="ital">matter</span> has nothing harsh about it, nor does it convey any <span class="ital">obligation</span>, which Philemon, had he been on the spot, would have fulfilled (Bleek), but simply the <span class="ital">trustful presupposition</span>, that Philemon himself would, if Paul had desired it, have ministered to him in the prison. Of this, however, Philemon was relieved by the service of the slave, which in this way <span class="ital">stood him in good stead</span>. Schweizer, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1858, p. 430, explains likewise correctly: <span class="ital">for thy benefit</span>, but takes this in the sense: “so that it would be a service rendered to thee, imputed to thee, <span class="ital">so that I would be under obligation to thee</span>.” But this would only have the delicacy and tenderness which are found in it, if the thought: “in order that he might serve me, with a view to place me under obligation to thee,” contained the design of <span class="ital">Onesimus</span>; if, accordingly, Paul had written something after this manner: <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἐβούλετο πρὸς ἐμαντὸν μένειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., which, however, would have asserted a self-determination incompetent to the position of a slave. No; as the passage is written, there is delicately and tenderly implied in the <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ σοῦ</span> the same thought, which, in accordance with <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Php 2:30</a>, he might have expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ σοῦ ὑστέρημα</span>; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/16-17.htm" title="I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.">1 Corinthians 16:17</a>.

The thought of the apostle accordingly is: But as I knew not thine own opinion, and thus must have acted without it, I was disposed to abstain from the retention of thy slave, which I had in view: <span class="ital">for the good, which thou showest, is not to be as if forced, but voluntary</span>. If I had retained Onesimus for my service, without having thy consent to that effect, the good, which I should have had to derive from thee through the service rendered to me by thy servant <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ σοῦ</span>, would have been shown <span class="ital">not from free will</span>,—that is, not in virtue of thine own self-determination,—but <span class="ital">as if compulsorily</span>, just because independently of thy <span class="greekheb">γνώμη</span> (“non enim potuisset refragari Philemon,” Bengel[75]). Observe at the same time that <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθόν σου</span>, <span class="ital">thy good</span>, that is, <span class="ital">the good which thou showest to others</span>, is to be left quite in its <span class="ital">generality</span>, so that not the serviceable employment of the slave <span class="ital">specially and in concreto</span> is meant, but rather the <span class="ital">category</span> in general, under which, in the intended <span class="ital">application, there falls that special</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθόν</span>, which is indicated in <a href="/philemon/1-13.htm" title="Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:">Philemon 1:13</a>. The restriction to the given case is impracticable on account of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛᾺ ΚΑΤᾺ ἙΚΟΎΣΙΟΝ</span></span></span>, since Paul in fact did not at all intend to procure the consent of Philemon and to retain Onesimus. This in opposition to the <span class="ital">usual</span> interpretation: “<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθόν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> beneficium tuum hocce, quo afficior a te, <span class="ital">si hunc mihi servum concedis</span>,” Heinrichs; comp. Bleek. But it is an error also, with de Wette, following Estius (who describes it as probable), to understand under <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σον</span> the <span class="ital">manumission</span>[76] of the slave, or to understand it at least as “also included” (Bleek), of which even in <a href="/philemon/1-16.htm" title="Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?">Philemon 1:16</a> there is no mention, and for suggesting which in so covert and enigmatic a fashion there would not have been any reason, if he had desired it at all (but see on <a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm" title="Are you called being a servant? care not for it: but if you may be made free, use it rather.">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>). According to Hofmann (comp. his <span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>, II. 2, p. 412), <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθόν σου</span> is, like <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΧΡΗΣΤῸΝ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> at <a href="/romans/2-4.htm" title="Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?">Romans 2:4</a>, <span class="ital">thy goodness</span>, and that <span class="ital">the</span> goodness, which <span class="ital">Philemon will show to Onesimus when he had returned into his position as a, slave</span>; this only then becomes an undoubtedly <span class="ital">spontaneous</span> goodness, when the apostle refrains from any injunction of his own, whereas Philemon <span class="ital">could not have done otherwise</span> than refrain from punishing the slave for his escape, if Paul had retained him to himself, in which case, therefore, Philemon might have seemed to be kind <span class="ital">compulsorily</span>. This explanation, brought out by the insertion of thoughts between the lines, is to be set aside as at variance with the context, since there is nothing in the connection to point to the definition of the notion of <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθόν σου</span> as goodness <span class="ital">towards Onesimus</span>, but on the contrary this expression can only acquire its import through the delicately thoughtful <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ὑπὲρ σοῦ μοι διακονῇ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην</span>] emphatically prefixed, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span> expresses the idea: “<span class="ital">so that it appears as constrained</span>.” Comp.

Deissmann (<span class="ital">Op cit.</span>, p. 222) points out that <span class="greekheb">κατέχω</span> is often used in papyri and on ostraka of <span class="ital">binding</span>, though in a magical sense.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ σοῦ</span>: “in thy stead,” the implication being that Philemon is placed under an obligation to his slave; for the force of <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span> as illustrated on the papyri, etc., see Deissmann’s important remarks on pp. 105, 241 ff. of his work already quoted.—<span class="greekheb">διακονῇ</span>: used in the Pauline Epistles both of Christian ministration generally (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-5.htm" title="And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.">1 Corinthians 12:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>) and in special reference to bodily wants, such as alms can supply (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-15.htm" title="I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.">2 Corinthians 8:4</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς δεσμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγ</span>.: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the bonds which the Gospel had tied, and which necessitated his being ministered unto.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</span>: see <a href="/context/mark/1-14.htm" title="Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,...">Mark 1:14-15</a> and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm" title="And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.">Matthew 4:23</a>; Christ uses the word often in reference to the Messianic Era. “The earliest instances of the use of <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγέλιον</span> in the sense of a book would be: Did. 8, 11, 15 <span class="ital">bis</span>; Ign. <span class="ital">Philad</span>. 5, 8 (Sanday, <span class="ital">Bampton Lectures</span>, p. 319).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/philemon/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">I would</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">I was wishing</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> the imperfect indicates a half-purpose, stopped by other considerations.

The story tells itself if we read between the lines. What steadfast adherence to principle on the part of the apostle, when the help of Onesimus would have been so welcome to him in his weak health, and his position as a prisoner! Philemon could hardly fail to think more favorably of Onesimus, when he saw how much importance the apostle attached to his services. <span class="cmt_word">In the bonds of the gospel.</span> "Which I am enduring for the sake of the gospel" (see Ver. 9) - a variation of phrase from Ver. 9 (and of our Lord's words, <a href="/mark/8-35.htm">Mark 8:35</a>; <a href="/mark/10-29.htm">Mark 10:29</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philemon/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I would (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., I would fain.

Bonds with which he is bound for the sake of the Gospel: with which Christ has invested him. A delicate hint at his sufferings is blended with an intimation of the authority which attaches to his appeal as a prisoner of Christ. This language of Paul is imitated by Ignatius. "My bonds exhort you" (Tralles, 12). "He (Jesus Christ) is my witness, in whom I am bound" (Philadelphia, 7). "In whom I bear about my bonds as spiritual pearls" (Ephesians, 11). "In the bonds which I bear about, I sing the praises of the churches" (Magnesians, 1). </body></html>
