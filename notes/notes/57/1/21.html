The word “obedience” is found in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2Corinthians 7:15</a>, there in connection with “fear and trembling.” He preferred to appeal to Philemon’s love; he knew that in any case he could rely on his deference.<p><span class= "bld">Do more than I say.</span>—This can hardly refer to anything except the manumission of Onesimus, and possibly his being sent back again to St. Paul.

Comp. the technical and forensic use of the word in <a href="/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="/acts/25-11.htm" title="For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.">Acts 25:11</a> : for good in one case, in the other for evil. If he was so “granted,” it would be by Cæsar instrumentally, by God’s overruling will ultimately. The passage, like <a href="/philippians/2-24.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.">Philippians 2:24</a>, but even more definitely, expresses St. Paul’s expectation of a release which might enable him to visit the East again.

Some commentators think the apostle here insinuates to Philemon, that it would be proper for him to give Onesimus his freedom, and many are of opinion that he actually did so. <span class="ital">But withal </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αμα δε</span>, <span class="ital">but at the same time, </span>that I beseech thee to pardon Onesimus, I request thee also to <span class="ital">prepare me a lodging </span>— In Colosse. “The apostle,” says Macknight, “having experienced the advantage of having a hired house of his own in Rome, where he preached the gospel to all who came to him, very prudently desired Philemon to provide for him such another house in Colosse, and not a lodging in Philemon’s own house, as some suppose. It seems he proposed to stay a while in Colosse, and wished to have a house in some frequented part of the city, to receive conveniently all who might be desirous of information concerning his doctrine.” Theodoret observes, that the apostle’s resolution to visit Philemon soon, signified to him in this letter, naturally added weight to his solicitation in behalf of Onesimus. <span class="ital">For I trust </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ελπιζω</span>, <span class="ital">I hope; that through your prayers I shall be given unto you </span>— Shall be restored to liberty. The efficacy which in Scripture is ascribed to prayer, is a great encouragement to the people of God to have recourse to it in all their straits, agreeably to the exhortation and example of Christ and his apostles. But to render prayer effectual, it must, as James observes, (<a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">James 1:6</a>,) be offered <span class="ital">in faith; </span>that is, in a full persuasion of the wisdom and power, goodness and faithfulness of God, and a confidence in him that, when we ask with sincerity, earnestness, and importunity, what is according to his will, or what his word authorizes us to ask, he will grant our petitions, as far as will be for our good and his glory. See <a href="/context/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:...">1 John 5:14-15</a>. On this passage, Whitby justly observes, that if the apostle believed the prayers of angels and departed saints were effectual for procuring blessings to God’s people on earth, it is strange that he hath not, throughout the whole of his epistles, so much as once addressed any prayers to them, or directed others so to do.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-22 When we speak of the nature of any sin or offence against God, the evil of it is not to be lessened; but in a penitent sinner, as God covers it, so must we. Such changed characters often become a blessing to all among whom they reside. Christianity does not do away our duties to others, but directs to the right doing of them. True penitents will be open in owning their faults, as doubtless Onesimus had been to Paul, upon his being awakened and brought to repentance; especially in cases of injury done to others. The communion of saints does not destroy distinction of property. This passage is an instance of that being imputed to one, which is contracted by another; and of one becoming answerable for another, by a voluntary engagement, that he might be freed from the punishment due to his crimes, according to the doctrine that Christ of his own will bore the punishment of our sins, that we might receive the reward of his righteousness. Philemon was Paul's son in the faith, yet he entreated him as a brother. Onesimus was a poor slave, yet Paul besought for him as if seeking some great thing for himself. Christians should do what may give joy to the hearts of one another. From the world they expect trouble; they should find comfort and joy in one another. When any of our mercies are taken away, our trust and hope must be in God. We must diligently use the means, and if no other should be at hand, abound in prayer. Yet, though prayer prevails, it does not merit the things obtained. And if Christians do not meet on earth, still the grace of the Lord Jesus will be with their spirits, and they will soon meet before the throne to join for ever in admiring the riches of redeeming love. The example of Onesimus may encourage the vilest sinners to return to God, but it is shamefully prevented, if any are made bold thereby to persist in evil courses. Are not many taken away in their sins, while others become more hardened? Resist not present convictions, lest they return no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having confidence in thy obedience - That you would comply with all my expressed desires.<p>I wrote unto thee - "I have written to you;" to wit, in this Epistle.<p>Knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say - In all the respects which he had mentioned - in receiving Onesimus, and in his kind treatment of him.
