(See <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Philippians 1:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>.) It describes the true order of Christian life, so fully and beautifully drawn out in <a href="/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>, beginning in faith, deepened by love, and so growing to knowledge.<p>But it may be asked, “Why the <span class= "ital">communication of</span> thy faith?” (1) The phrase is unique, but the word rendered “communication” is the well-known word generally rendered “communion,” or “fellowship,” except where (as in <a href="/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.">2Corinthians 8:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;">2Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm" title="But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.">Hebrews 13:16</a>) it is used technically and derivatively of “the communication” of almsgiving. The phrase, therefore, should probably be rendered the “communion of thy faith,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“thy fellowship in faith.” (2) But, again, the question arises, “With whom is this fellowship? With God or man?” The answer probably is, “With both.” Perhaps for growth in divine knowledge the communion need only be with God. But we observe that the knowledge is not merely “of every good thing,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of all that is of God, but of “every good thing which is in you (or, better, <span class= "ital">in us</span>) towards Christ Jesus.” It is, therefore, the knowledge of good—that is, of God’s gift—as dwelling in man by the unity which binds all to Christ Jesus. (3) Now for knowledge of this, fellowship with man is needed, as well as fellowship with God. The soul which dwells alone with God, even in the holiest seclusion, knows what is good in the abstract, but not what is good in man in the concrete reality. But Philemon’s house was a centre of Christian life. St. Paul might, therefore, well speak of this his two-fold “fellowship in faith,” and pray that it might grow into full knowledge at once of God and of man as in Him. (4) That all such growth must be “towards Christ Jesus,” dependent on unity with Him and serving to deepen such unity, is the characteristic doctrine of all this group of Epistles, especially of the Colossian Epistle, of which Onesimus was one of the bearers.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philemon/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 Faith in Christ, and love to him, should unite saints more closely than any outward relation can unite the people of the world. Paul in his private prayers was particular in remembering his friends. We must remember Christian friends much and often, as their cases may need, bearing them in our thoughts, and upon our hearts, before our God. Different sentiments and ways in what is not essential, must not make difference of affection, as to the truth. He inquired concerning his friends, as to the truth, growth, and fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him, and to all the saints. The good which Philemon did, was matter of joy and comfort to him and others, who therefore desired that he would continue and abound in good fruits, more and more, to God's honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philemon/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the communication of thy faith - That is, this was a subject of prayer on the part of the apostle, that the "communication of his faith" might receive from all the proper acknowledgment of the good which he did in the Christian cause. The phrase translated "communication of thy faith," means the making of thy faith common to others; that is, enabling others to partake of the fruits of it, to wit, by good deeds. On the meaning of the word here rendered "communication" (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  koino&#772;nia), see the notes at <a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>; compare <a href="/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>. Calvin has well expressed the sense of this passage. "It is to be observed that the apostle here does not proceed in the commendation of Philemon, but rather expresses what he desires for him from the Lord. These words are connected with those in which he says that he remembered him in his prayers. What, therefore, did he desire for Philemon? That his faith, expressing itself by good fruits, might be shown to be true and not vain. For he calls that the communication of his faith when it does not remain inoperative within, but bears itself forth to benefit men by its proper effects. For although faith has its proper seat in the heart, yet it communicates itself to men by good works." The meaning is, that he desired that Philemon would so make common the proper fruits of faith by his good deeds toward others, that all might acknowledge it to be genuine and efficacious.<p>May become effectual - Greek, "May be energetic" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2;  energe&#772;s); may become operative, active, effective.<p>By the acknowledging - That is, so as to secure from others the proper recognition of the existence of faith in your heart. In other words, so that others may see that you are truly pious, and understand to what extent you have faith.<p>Of every good thing which is in you - Of every good principle, and of every benevolent trait, which is in your character. That is, the proper outward expression of his faith in Christ, by doing good to others, would be a development of the benevolence which existed in his heart.<p>In Christ Jesus - Or "toward (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;  eis) Christ Jesus." The goodness in his heart had respect to the Lord Jesus as its proper object, but would be made manifest by his kindness to men. The truth which is taught in this passage, therefore, is, that when faith exists in the heart, it is very desirable that it should impart its proper fruits toward others in such a way that all may see that it is operative, and may recognize its power; or in other words, it is desirable that when true religion exists it should be fairly developed, that its possessor may be acknowledged to be under its influence. We should wish that he may have all the credit and honor which the goodness of his heart is entitled to. Paul supposed that a case had now occurred in which an opportunity was furnished to Philemon to show the world how much he was governed by the faith of the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philemon/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. That&#8212;The aim of my thanksgiving and prayers for thee is, in order that the, &c.<p>the communication of thy faith&#8212;the imparting of it and its fruits (namely, acts of love and beneficence: as Heb 13:16, "to communicate," that is, to impart a share) to others; or, the liberality to others flowing from thy faith (so the Greek is translated, "liberal distribution," 2Co 9:13).<p>effectual by&#8212;Greek, "in"; the element in which his liberality had place, that is, may be proved by acts in, &c.<p>acknowledging&#8212;Greek, "the thorough knowledge," that is, the experimental or practical recognition.<p>of every good thing which is in you&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "which is in US," that is, the practical recognition of every grace which is in us Christians, in so far as we realize the Christian character. In short, that thy faith may by acts be proved to be "a faith which worketh by love."<p>in Christ Jesus&#8212;rather as Greek, "unto Christ Jesus," that is, to the glory of Christ Jesus. Two of the oldest manuscripts omit "Jesus." This verse answers to Phm 5, "thy love and faith toward all saints"; Paul never ceases to mention him in his prayers, in order that his faith may still further show its power in his relation to others, by exhibiting every grace which is in Christians to the glory of Christ.

The grace of faith itself cannot be communicated from one to another; a believing parent cannot communicate it to his children, nor a master to his servants, nor a minister to his hearers; but an account of it, of its actings and exercises, of the joy of it, and of the peace a soul is filled with through believing, may be given to the mutual comfort and edification of saints; and it may be shown forth to others by the fruits of it, works of righteousness: but here it seems to design acts of beneficence, communicating to the necessities of others, as flowing from faith; and these words are to be connected with Plm 1:4 as a part of the apostle's prayers, as what is contained in the preceding verse is the matter of his thanksgiving. And his prayer is, that such a communication of good things, which springs from faith, <p>may be effectual; to answer some very good purposes, the good of others, and the service of the interest of Christ, and the glory of God; or, as the Vulgate Latin version reads, only by the change of one letter, that it "may be evident"; to which the Syriac version seems to incline, rendering it, that it "may be fruitful in works"; or show itself in fruits of righteousness, in works of mercy and kindness; and the apostle's sense is, that it might be more and more so: <p>by the acknowledging of every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus; the meaning is, that every good thing that is in the saints, or among them, should be acknowledged to come to them in and through Christ Jesus, in whom all fulness of grace dwells, and from whom all is imparted; and that every good thing that is communicated, or done in faith, which is effectual to any good purpose, should be owned as done by the grace and strength of Christ, and be done to his saints, as if done to himself, and be directed to his glory: the phrase, "in you", respects not Philemon only, but Apphia, Archippus, and the church in Philemon's house; the Arabic version reads, in us. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philemon/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> communication of thy faith may become effectual by the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span><p>(a) By fellowship of faith, he means those duties of charity which are given to the saints, and flow from a productive faith.<p>(b) That by this means all men may perceive how rich you are in Christ, that is, in faith, charity, and all bountifulness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philemon/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philemon/1-6.htm" title="That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.">Philemon 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅπως κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] cannot, as is <span class="ital">usually</span> held (also by Winer, de Wette, Demme, Koch, Ellicott, Bleek, and Hofmann), introduce the aim of the <span class="ital">intercession</span>, <a href="/philemon/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,">Philemon 1:4</a>, since <span class="greekheb">μνείαν σου ποιούμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. was only an accompanying definition, and <span class="greekheb">ἀκούων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. already pointed back to <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστῶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

In order to the right interpretation observe further, on the one hand, that <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> is with Paul, as mostly also with classical writers, when it is not accompanied by the genitive of the <span class="ital">personal pronoun</span> (<a href="/philippians/1-5.htm" title="For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;">Php 1:5</a>), always so employed, that the genitive therewith connected denotes that <span class="ital">with which</span> the fellowship, or <span class="ital">in which</span> the participation, takes place (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

Accordingly there is at once set aside—(1) the traditional interpretation since the time of Chrysostom and Theophylact: “fides tua, quam communem nobiscum habes,” Bengel, comp. Luther, Wetstein, and many; in which case the genitive has been taken subjectively, as by Wiesinger: thy <span class="ital">faith-fellowship with all saints</span>; and by Ewald: “that thou believest in Christ not merely for thyself.” And there fall also (2) all interpretations, which transform the notion of <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> into <span class="ital">communicatio</span>, such as that of Beza (comp. Castalio, Cornelius a Lapide, Estius, Hammond, Heinrichs): “<span class="ital">officia benignitatis in sanctos</span> promanantia ex fide efficaci.” Similarly also Calvin: “fidei communicationem appellat, <span class="ital">quum intus non latet otiosa, sed per veros effectus se profert ad homines</span>;” he is followed substantially by de Wette (and Koch): “the communion of thy faith (genitivus <span class="ital">subjecti</span>), <span class="ital">as well in the display of love towards individuals as in the advancement of the gospel</span>,” which latter element cannot be brought hither from <span class="greekheb">συνεργ</span>., <a href="/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>, and is out of place (comp. <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>). As the correct interpretation there remains only this, keeping the notion of <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> in consistency with <a href="/philemon/1-5.htm" title="Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;">Philemon 1:5</a> : <span class="ital">the fellowship entered into with thy Christian fidelity</span>.

An appeal to the profound Christian consciousness of Philemon, by way of preparation for the designed intercession on behalf of Onesimus, whom Paul in fact was now on the point of introducing to that <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία τῆς πίστεως</span> of his friend! Respecting the manifold <span class="ital">other</span> explanations of <span class="greekheb">ἐνεργὴς γένηται κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., it is to be observed, on the one hand, that we have not, with many (including Wiesinger and Hofmann), arbitrarily to restrict the notion of <span class="greekheb">ἐνεργής</span> to the exercise <span class="ital">of love</span>, but to extend it to the <span class="ital">collective activity of the Christian life</span>; and, on the other hand, that as the subject of the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> is not Philemon, but <span class="ital">others</span> (comp. also Bleek), the <span class="ital">latter</span>, namely the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνοὶ τῆς πίστεώς σου</span>, must also be the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span>; by which all expositions, according to which <span class="ital">Philemon</span> is held to be this knowing subject, are set aside, whether <span class="greekheb">παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ</span> be taken in the moral sense, of every virtue (Chrysostom), of good works and the like, or (although in itself correctly) of the Christian blessings of salvation, which are to be known. Hence we have to reject the interpretation of Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ ἐπιγνῶναί σε καὶ πράττειν πᾶν ἀγαθόν</span>, in which case the <span class="ital">doing</span> is arbitrarily imported, as is also done by Theophylact, according to whom <span class="greekheb">ἐπιγινώσκειν</span> is held to be equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾶν καὶ μεταχειρίζεσθαι</span>. So likewise in substance de Wette, who mixes up moral action as keeping equal pace with moral knowledge, and takes <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐν ἡμῖν</span> as: the good which is as to <span class="ital">principle and spirit</span> in us Christians; he is followed by Demme and Koch. We have further to reject the explanation of Flatt (so in substance also Osiander, Calovius, Bengel): “thy faith shows itself active <span class="ital">through love, by means of a grateful recognition of all the benefits</span>,” etc., or (as Wiesinger puts it): “<span class="ital">inasmuch as it</span> (namely, thy <span class="ital">fellowship of faith</span>) <span class="ital">recognises</span>—which is possible only for <span class="ital">love—in the other the good which is in him</span>.” We have to set aside, lastly, the explanation of Hofmann, who, after the example of Michaelis,[68] retaining the reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, and taking <span class="greekheb">παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ</span> as <span class="ital">masculine</span>, finds in <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπιγνώσει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. the meaning, that <span class="ital">every one in the Christian sense good</span>, every true Christian among the Colossians,[69] <span class="ital">Philemon should know as being that which he is</span>; only by virtue of such knowing would his fellowship of faith show itself effectively operative through the exercise of Christian love—which would <span class="ital">not</span> be the case with those “<span class="ital">whose Christian virtuousness he failed to know</span>.” Erasmus, Castalio, Beza, Calvin, Grotius, Pricaeus, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, and others, have done rightly in not referring the <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span> to Philemon as the knowing subject, but wrongly in understanding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊΓΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> of <span class="ital">becoming known</span>, as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.: “adeo ut nullum sit officium Christianae caritatis, in quo non sis <span class="ital">et nolus et probatus</span>.” Beza: “ut hac ratione omnes <span class="ital">agnoscant et experiantur</span>, quam divites sitis in Christo,” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοῦ</span>] Comp. <a href="/romans/14-16.htm" title="Let not then your good be evil spoken of:">Romans 14:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm" title="Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.">Galatians 6:6</a>; <a href="/luke/1-53.htm" title="He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.">Luke 1:53</a>; <a href="/context/luke/12-18.htm" title="And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods....">Luke 12:18-19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/12-1.htm" title="When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefits.">Sir 12:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/14-25.htm" title="He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are.">Sir 14:25</a>, <span class="ital">al.</span>; <span class="greekheb">πᾶν ἀγαθὸν τὸ ἐν ἡμῖν</span> really expresses quite the same thing as is expressed at <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a> by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠᾶΣΑ ΕὐΛΟΓΊΑ ΠΝΕΥΜΑΤΙΚΉ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΤΟῦ ἘΝ ἩΜῖΝ</span></span></span>] applies to the <span class="ital">Christians generally</span>, these being regarded as a whole.
