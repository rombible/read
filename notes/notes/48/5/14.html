The apostle urges that all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. If Christians, who should help one another, and rejoice one another, quarrel, what can be expected but that the God of love should deny his grace, that the Spirit of love should depart, and the evil spirit, who seeks their destruction, should prevail? Happy would it be, if Christians, instead of biting and devouring one another on account of different opinions, would set themselves against sin in themselves, and in the places where they live.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all the law is fulfilled ... - That is, this expresses the substance of the whole law; it embraces and comprises all. The apostle of course here alludes to the Law in regard to our duty to our fellow-men, since that was the point which he particularly enforces. He is saying that this law would counteract all the evil workings of the flesh, and if this were fulfilled, all our duty to others would be discharged. A similar sentiment he has expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8-10</a>; see the notes at that passage. The turn here in the discussion is worthy of particular notice. With great skill he changes the subject from a doctrinal argument to a strain of practical remark, and furnishes most important lessons for the right mode of overcoming our corrupt and sensual passions, and discharging our duty to others.<p>Thou shalt love thy neighbor ... - See this explained in the note at <a href="/matthew/19-19.htm">Matthew 19:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. all the law&#8212;Greek, "the whole law," namely, the Mosaic law. Love to God is presupposed as the root from which love to our neighbor springs; and it is in this tense the latter precept (so "word" means here) is said to be the fulfilling of "all the law" (Le 19:18).

Not the ceremonial law, to which acts of mercy, kindness, and love are opposed, and from which they are distinguished; but the law of the decalogue given to Moses on Mount Sinai, and by him to the people of the Jews; and intends either only the second table of it, since only love to the neighbour is mentioned; or else the whole of it, both tables, since it is said, "all the law"; which by Christ is reduced to two heads, love to God, and love to the neighbour; and though the former is not here expressed, it is implied as a cause in the effect, for the love of God is the cause, and so the evidence of love to the neighbour; nor can there be the one without the other. The two tables of the law consist of , "ten words"; as the (s) Jews commonly call them, and we the decalogue, and yet they are fulfilled in one; that is, they are to be brought into such a compendium, reduced to such an head; or as the apostle in a parallel place says, they may briefly be comprehended in this saying, <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>. The Jews make the commandments of the law to be a very large number indeed, but at last reduce them to one, as the apostle here does, <p>"six hundred and thirteen commandments (they say (t)) were given to Moses----David came and reduced them to eleven, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/15.htm">Psalm 15</a>, Isaiah came and reduced them to six, <a href="/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a> Micah came and reduced them to three, <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> Isaiah came and reduced them to two, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-1.htm">Isaiah 56:1</a>, Amos came and reduced them to one, <a href="/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a> but this being objected to, it is observed that Habakkuk came,  , "and reduced them to one", <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> that is faith, as here the apostle reduces them to love:'' <p>even in this, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: these words are taken out of <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and which R. Akiba says (u), agreeably with the apostle, whose contemporary he was, is  , "the grand general rule in the law"; or the grand comprehensive of the law: the object of love, the "neighbour", signifies not only, as there the Jews explain it, those of their own people, or proselytes to their religion; but all sorts of men, whether in a natural, civil, or spiritual relation; and whether those that do us good or do us ill, friends or enemies: the measure or rule of love is, "as thyself"; and designs not an equality of affection, but a likeness of effects; that is, to do the same kind acts of love to others, one would choose to have done to ourselves: and this is the fulfilling of the law; that is, so far as a man loves aright, so far he fulfils the law; not that he does it perfectly, for man in his fallen state is unable to do that, for the law is exceeding broad, and reaches to thoughts, desires, and inclinations, as well as to words and deeds; and besides, love said to be the fulfilling of it, is imperfect; hence then there can be no justification by works of charity, nor by any services of men, which at best are imperfect; nor are they done in their own strength, and without the grace of God; nor is there any that can be said to have fulfilled the law perfectly but Christ, and to him must we look for a justifying righteousness. These words contain a reason engaging to love one another, and to do all kind of offices of love to each other; since it is a main and principal thing contained in the law, and to which that may be reduced. <p>(s) <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34.htm">Exodus 34</a>.28.

But it is to be answered by placing ourselves at the lofty spiritual standpoint of the apostle, from which he regarded all other commandments of the law as so thoroughly subordinate to the commandment of love, that whosoever has fulfilled <span class="ital">this</span> commandment stands in the moral scale and the moral estimation just as if he had fulfilled the <span class="ital">whole</span> law. From this lofty and bold standpoint everything, which was not connected with the commandment of love (<a href="/context/romans/13-8.htm" title="Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law....">Romans 13:8-10</a>), fell so completely into the background,[236] that it was no longer considered as aught to be separately and independently fulfilled; on the contrary, the <span class="ital">whole</span> law appeared already accomplished in <span class="ital">love</span>, that is, in the state of feeling and action produced by the Spirit of God (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a> f.; <a href="/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;">Romans 15:30</a>), in which is contained the culminating point, goal, and consummation of all parts of the law.[237] The idea thus amounts to an <span class="ital">impletio totius legis dilectione formata</span>, by which the claim of the law is satisfied (<a href="/galatians/5-23.htm" title="Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.">Galatians 5:23</a>). The view of Hofmann, that here the law comes into consideration only <span class="ital">so far as</span> it is not already <span class="ital">fulfilled</span> in faith; that for the <span class="ital">believer</span> its requirement consists in <span class="ital">the commandment of love</span>, and even the realization of this is already <span class="ital">existing in him</span>, so that he has only to <span class="ital">show</span> the love wrought in him by God—simply emanates from the erroneous form of the text and the wrong interpretation of <a href="/galatians/5-14.htm" title="For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Galatians 5:14</a> adopted by him. That the apostle, moreover, while adducing <span class="ital">only</span> the commandment of <span class="ital">love towards one’s neighbour</span>, does not exclude the commandment of <span class="ital">love towards God</span> (comp. <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.">Matthew 22:37</a> f.), was obvious of itself to the Christian consciousness from the necessary connection between the love of God and the love of our neighbour (comp. <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-3.htm" title="But if any man love God, the same is known of him.">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>). Paul was induced by the scope of the context to bring forward the latter only (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-15.htm" title="But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.">Galatians 5:15</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[234] Hofmann reads the verse: <span class="greekheb">ὁ γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πᾶς νόμος ἑν ὑμῖν πεπλήρωται</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπήσεις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: love therefore is the fulfilment (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Law." This passage of the Romans may be regarded as a lengthened paraphrase of the one now before us. From the comparison of the two, several things are made clear. We see from it what is meant by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "hath been fulfilled." Some have been disposed to regard it as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "it is summed up." Not to urge that it is very doubtful whether the verb admits of this sense, it is enough to observe that in the parallel passage the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, both in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, hath fulfilled, and the verbal <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, fulfilment, means to fulfil in <span class="accented">actual</span> obedience; and that the perfect tense of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of this passage reappears in the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> of the other. The sentence in Romans, "He that loveth his neighbour (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) hath fulfilled the Law," that is, as the context shows, "the whole Law," makes it clear that, by the words before us, "the whole Law hath been fulfilled in one word," is meant that the whole Law hath been fulfilled in the fulfilling of the one word, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." The whole Law is regarded as couched in that "one word." In the larger passage the Law, so far as it is explained, is represented as regulating our behaviour to our neighbours, for the apostle cites exclusively commandments of the "second table;" in addition to which, we observe that the immediately preceding context (vers. 1-7) is taken up with the discussion of duties to our fellow-men, sliding into what follows through the words, "Owe no man anything, save to love one another." This suggests the inference that when the apostle says, "He that loveth hath fulfilled the Law;" and at the close of the paragraph, "Love is the fulfilment of the Law," he has in view that part only of the Law which enforces the duties appertaining to human relationships, and not the whole Law as enforcing, together with these, the duties we owe to God; for "love," he says, "his the fulfilment of the Law, <span class="accented">because</span> it worketh no evil <span class="accented">to his neighbour."</span> And this might seem further to justify the like inference with reference to the passage before us; and here also the immediate context (ver. 13) points only to relations between man and man, making no reference to our relations towards God. And this inference we seem warranted in accepting. Only, we have to bear in mind that the apostle has already taken account of our spiritual relations to God, in stating (ver. 6) that in Christ Jesus the all-important and only thing is faith working through love. For the faith which he means is plainly the principle which unites the soul to Christ Jesus, and in him to God as our reconciled Father, through the vitalizing and actuating power of the Spirit of adoption. And precisely the same consideration presents itself with respect to the parallel passage in the Romans; for there, too, the apostle has been previously engaged in building up the gospel doctrine of Christ's redeeming us from the control of a condemning Law, which is also mere "letter," and can give no spiritual life; and of his handing us over to the law of the Spirit of life, whereby the requirement of the Law is fulfilled in them who walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>). The apostle takes it for granted that it is with these views in their minds that his readers will receive what he here writes. Further, account is to be  taken of the spiritual sense in which the apostle uses the terms "law" and "love." Under the term "law" he no longer intends the Law of Moses, either as a ceremonial institute or as a letter-Law regulating moral behaviour; but that higher and spiritual law, of which the precepts of the letter-Law are only incomplete hints or adumbrations - the good and acceptable and perfect will of God (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). Likewise, by the term "love" he designates a very different thing from that principle of kindness, good nature, benevolence, which an Aristotle or Cicero, an Epictetus or Plutarch, could conceive and describe, and in their own practice exemplify; with St. Paul, as with St. John, it is a fruit of the Spirit, an emanation of Christ's life in the soul, organically and vitally ramifying out of filial love to God. They that were in the flesh <span class="accented">could</span> not please God. In order that we may fulfil the Law, the prime and indispensable requisite is that the Spirit of Christ be dwelling in us and leading us. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>All the law (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>More correctly, the whole law.
