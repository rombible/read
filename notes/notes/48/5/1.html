By this precept, the apostle likewise condemns the superstitious bodily services enjoined by the Church of Rome, which are really of the same nature with those prescribed by Moses, with this difference, that none of them are of divine appointment.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Christ will not be the Saviour of any who will not own and rely upon him as their only Saviour. Let us take heed to the warnings and persuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit, wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object of their hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sake of their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies or assert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend to them, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges or profession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God, and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of old was not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms and observances now are. But without faith working by love, all else is worthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stand fast, therefore - Be firm and unwavering.

There is the liberty of grace, and the liberty of glory; the former of these is here meant, and lies in a freedom from sin; not from the indwelling of it, but from the dominion, guilt, and damning power of it; from the captivity and tyranny of Satan, though not from his temptations and insults; from the law, the ceremonial law, as an handwriting of ordinances, a rigid severe schoolmaster, and a middle wall of partition, and from all its burdensome rites and institutions; from the moral law as a covenant of works, and as administered by Moses; and from the curse and condemnation of it, its bondage and rigorous exaction, and from all expectation of life and righteousness by the deeds of it; but not from obedience to it, as held forth by Christ, and as a rule of walk and conversation; and from the judicial law, or those laws which concerned the Jews as Jews: moreover, this liberty lies in the free use of things indifferent, as eating any sort of food without distinction, so that it be done in faith, with thankfulness to God, in moderation, and with temperance, and so as that the peace and edification of fellow Christians are not hurt; also in the free use of Gospel ordinances, which they that are fellow citizens with the saints have a right unto, but not to lay aside or neglect at pleasure; which is not to use, but to abuse their liberty: again, another branch of it is access to God, with freedom and boldness at the throne of grace, through the Mediator, under the influences of the divine Spirit; to which may be added, a deliverance from the fears of death corporeal, who is a king of terrors to Christless sinners, and which kept Old Testament saints, all their lifetime subject to bondage and eternal, or the second death, by which Christ's freemen are assured they shall not be hurt: now, in this liberty, the children of the free woman, believers under the Gospel dispensation, are very pertinently exhorted to stand fast, in consequence and consideration of their character; that is, they should highly prize and esteem it, as men do their civil liberty; and maintain it and defend it, at all hazards; abide by the doctrine of it without wavering, and with intrepidity; not giving up anyone part of it, however, and by whomsoever, it may be opposed, maligned, and reproached; and keep up the practice of it, by obeying from the heart the doctrine of it, by becoming the servants of righteousness, by frequent attendance at the throne of grace, and continual observance of the ordinances of Christ; and then should take heed of everything that tends to break in upon it, as any doctrine or commandment of men; particularly the doctrine of justification by works, and all sorts of superstition and will worship: and the rather, because of the concern Christ has in this liberty, it is that <p>wherewith Christ hath made us free; we are not free born, but on the contrary homeborn slaves, as Ephraim was; nor could this liberty in any of its branches be obtained by us, by any merit, righteousness, act, or acts of ours, but is wholly of Christ's procuring for us, both by price and power; whereby he has ransomed and delivered us out of the hands of all our spiritual enemies, sin, Satan, the law, and death; and it is of his proclaiming in the Gospel, and of his applying by his Spirit, whom he sends down into our hearts as a free Spirit, to acquaint us with it, and lead us into it, who works faith in us to lay hold upon, and receive this blessing of grace as others: <p>and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. The metaphor is taken from oxen put under a yoke, and implicated with it, from which they cannot disengage themselves: some of the members of this church had been Jews, who had formerly been under the yoke of the law, and seemed desirous to return to their former state of bondage, from which the apostle dissuades, and therefore uses the word again: or else he may refer to the bondage of corruption and idolatry, which they as Gentiles were in, before their conversion; and intimates, that to give into the observance of; Jewish rites and ceremonies would be involving themselves in a state of bondage again; for by "the yoke of bandage" he means the law, which the Jews frequently call  "the yoke of the commandments" (l); particularly the ceremonial law, as circumcision; which Peter, <a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a> represents as a yoke intolerable; the observation of days, months, times, and years; the multitude of sacrifices, and which could not take away sin; but proclaimed their guilt and obligation to punishment, and were an handwriting of ordinances against them, and thereby they were held and kept in bondage, and such a yoke is the moral law as delivered by Moses, requiring perfect obedience, but giving no strength to perform, nor pointing where any is to be had; showing a man his sin and misery, and so working wrath in his conscience, but giving not the least intimation of a Saviour, or of life and righteousness by another; accusing, pronouncing guilty, cursing, and condemning; hence such as seek for righteousness by it are in a miserable subjection to it, and are sadly implicated and entangled with the yoke of it: every doctrine and ordinance of men is a yoke of bondage which should not be submitted to; nay, any action whatever, performed in a religious way and in order for a man's acceptance with God, and to obtain his favour, and according to his observance of which he judges of his state, and speaks peace and comfort to himself, or the reverse, is a yoke of bondage: as, for instance prayer at such and so many times a day, reading such a number of chapters in the Bible every day, fasting so many times in the week, and the like; so that what are branches of Christian liberty, such as frequent prayer to God, reading the sacred writings for instruction and comfort, and the free use of the creatures, are turned into a yoke of bondage, which should be guarded against. <p>(l) Misn.

(Bernhardy, p. 107; Lobeck, <span class="ital">Paral</span>, p. 523 ff.), and of the frequent use both in the LXX. and the N.T. (Winer, p. 434 [E. T. 584]) of “cognate” nouns in the dative. But this mode of expression does not occur elsewhere with Paul, not even in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-9.htm" title="For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God;">1 Thessalonians 3:9</a>. According to Schott, Ewald, and Matthias, who join it to <a href="/galatians/4-31.htm" title="So then, brothers, we are not children of the female slave, but of the free.">Galatians 4:31</a> (see the critical notes), we get the meaning: “<span class="ital">We are not children of a bond-maid, but of the free woman through the freedom, with which Christ made us free; stand fast therefore</span>.” Thus <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐλευθερίᾳ ἧ ἡμᾶς Χριστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἠλευθ</span>. becomes a self-evident appendage; and <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> receives an emphasis, just as in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>, which its position does not warrant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/galatians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/galatians/5-1.htm" title="Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.">Galatians 5:1</a>. In the original text, which I have adopted in accordance with the best MS. authority, the first clause of this verse is clearly detached from the second <span class="greekheb">στήκετε οὖν</span>, and attached to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τῆς ἐλευθέρας</span> without any connecting particle. But this primary connection with the preceding verse was apparently obscured at an early period of Church history, owing probably to the frequent use of the important section <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm" title="Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.">Galatians 5:1</a> ff. as a Church lesson by itself apart from the preceding allegory. It is difficult otherwise to account for the great variety of connecting particles employed in MS. versions and quotations to transform the fragment <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐλευθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς Χριστὸς ἠλευθ</span>. into a complete sentence, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the addition of <span class="greekheb">ᾖ</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, or <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, and the omission of <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> after <span class="greekheb">στήκετε</span>, all evidently corrections made with one object. The division of chapters has unfortunately perpetuated this error. But the removal of the full stop after <span class="greekheb">ἐλευθέρας</span> at once restores the full force of the original passage: <span class="ital">Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but Christ set us free with the freedom of the freewoman</span>. The threefold iteration, <span class="ital">free, freedom, freewoman</span>, marks with expressive emphasis the importance of this Christian birthright.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς Χριστὸς</span>. The best MSS. place the object <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> before the subject <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>, inverting the usual order of words. This inversion throws an emphasis on <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>, as the previous context demands; for the whole passage forcibly contrasts the freedom granted to us Christians with the bondage which the Jews inherit.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ πάλιν</span> … Converts had all alike, whether Jews or Greeks, been under bondage to some law, human or divine: all had been set free by Christ, but might now, by the voluntary adoption of circumcision, forfeit this freedom and rivet the yoke of Law about their own necks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/galatians/5-1.htm" title="Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage....">Galatians 5:1-12</a></span>.

Many editors place this verse at the end of ch. 4, connecting it immediately with <span class="ital"><a href="/galatians/4-31.htm" title="So then, brothers, we are not children of the female slave, but of the free.">Galatians 4:31</a></span> of that chapter; ‘we are not children of a bondwoman, but of her who is free with that freedom wherewith Christ hath emancipated us. Stand fast therefore and be not again entangled with a yoke of bondage’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the received arrangement of the chapters is better. Chapter 4 is didactic; chapter 5 is hortatory, and therefore properly begins with the injunction ‘stand fast’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is however interesting to note that in the original the last word of ch. 4 is ‘free’, and ‘the freedom’ are the opening words of ch. 5. We have a similar instance of the repetition of a word in juxtaposition in <a href="/context/romans/15-12.htm" title="And again, Esaias said, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust....">Romans 15:12-13</a>, ‘In Him shall the Gentiles <span class="ital">hope</span>.

The freedom thus bestowed is spiritual liberty which is quite independent of outward circumstances. St Paul in chains, a prisoner in Rome, exulted in it. Nero on his throne, the master of the world, with thirty legions at his back, was the miserable slave of his lusts. Luther beautifully remarks: ‘Let us learn to count this our freedom most noble, exalted, and precious, which no emperor, no prophet nor patriarch, no angel from heaven, but Christ, God’s Son, hath obtained for us; not that He might relieve us from a bodily and temporal subjection, but from a spiritual and eternal imprisonment of the cruelest tyrants, namely the law, sin, death, the Devil’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Stand fast</span>] perhaps, ‘stand upright’, not bowing your neck to the yoke of legal observances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">again</span>] They who had escaped from the thraldom of heathenism were not to submit to the slavery of Judaism.

For the Jews had been accustomed to look upon circumcision rather as a part of the law received by Moses, than as the sign of the promise given to Abraham, <a href="/john/7-22.htm" title="Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.">John 7:22</a>. Nor was circumcision so much a yoke in itself, as it was made a yoke by the law; and the law itself was much more a yoke. Therefore Paul, by a weighty metonymy, puts the consequent for the antecedent: Be not circumcised, for he who is circumcised, along with this part of it, comes under the whole law, and revolts from Christ, <a href="/context/galatians/5-2.htm" title="Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing....">Galatians 5:2-4</a>. Nor does the apostle oppose Christ so immediately to circumcision as he does to the law. He speaks according to their perverse custom, while he refutes their Galatism and Judaism; and yet he does not at all deviate from the truth. Peter also, <a href="/acts/15-10.htm" title="Now therefore why tempt you God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?">Acts 15:10</a>, calls it a <span class="ital">yoke</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐνέχεσθε</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐνέχομαι</span>, in the middle voice, <span class="ital">I hold fast by, obstinately</span>.
