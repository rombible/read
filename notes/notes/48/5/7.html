The persecutions that I have to undergo from the Jews are proof that I preach it no longer. If I do preach circumcision then the other stumbling-blocks in the way of my teaching are removed. I have no need to lay stress upon a crucified Messiah. The advocates of circumcision may carry their self-mutilation a step further if they please.<p>This section is very abrupt in style.

The exercises of faith and holiness, enjoined in the gospel, are often in Scripture compared to the ancient athletic exercises of the Greeks, especially to the <span class="ital">race; </span>because in that exercise the greatest exertions of activity and strength were necessary to obtain the prize, <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>. <span class="ital">Who did hinder you </span>— Who hath interrupted you in that good course; <span class="ital">that ye should not </span>continue to <span class="ital">obey the truth? </span>— In this question the apostle does not ask who the person was that had put a stop to them; but he expresses his surprise and grief at their being stopped. <span class="ital">This persuasion — </span>Concerning the Mosaic law, and the necessity of observing it in order to your justification and salvation; <span class="ital">cometh not </span>of God, <span class="ital">who calleth you </span>— To his kingdom and glory. <span class="ital">A little leaven</span> — If it be suffered to continue; <span class="ital">leaveneth the whole lump </span>— Operates unseen, till it diffuses itself on every side: that is, a little false doctrine may soon corrupt the judgment in other points, and a small number of seduced persons may soon infect the whole church. It is a proverbial expression, in which the pernicious and infectious nature of erroneous doctrine and vicious example is set forth. Hence our Lord gave the name of <span class="ital">leaven </span>to the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees, <a href="/context/matthew/16-11.htm" title="How is it that you do not understand that I spoke it not to you concerning bread, that you should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?...">Matthew 16:11-12</a>.

It is not enough that we profess Christianity, but we must run well, by living up to that profession. Many who set out fairly in religion, are hindered in their progress, or turn out of the way. It concerns those who begin to turn out of the way, or to tire in it, seriously to inquire what hinders them. The opinion or persuasion, ver. 8, was, no doubt, that of mixing the works of the law with faith in Christ in justification. The apostle leaves them to judge whence it must arise, but sufficiently shows that it could be owing to none but Satan. It is dangerous for Christian churches to encourage those who follow, but especially who spread, destructive errors. And in reproving sin and error, we should always distinguish between the leaders and the led. The Jews were offended, because Christ was preached as the only salvation for sinners. If Paul and others would have admitted that the observance of the law of Moses was to be joined with faith in Christ, as necessary to salvation, then believers might have avoided many of the sufferings they underwent. The first beginnings of such leaven should be opposed. And assuredly those who persist in disturbing the church of Christ must bear their judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye did run well - The Christian life is often represented as a race; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-26</a>.

Dr. Doddridge remarks that this is "an Olympic expression, and properly signifies "coming across the course" while a person is running in it, in such a manner as to jostle, and throw him out of the way." Paul asks, with emphasis, who it could have been that retarded them in their Christian course, implying that it could have been done only by their own consent, or that there was really no cause why they should not have continued as they began.<p>That ye should not obey the truth - The true system of justification by faith in the Redeemer.

Whether, however, the word is to be understood <span class="ital">actively</span>, as <span class="ital">persuasion</span>, or <span class="ital">passively</span>, as <span class="ital">compliance</span>, is a point which must be decided in the several passages by the context. In this passage it is understood as <span class="ital">persuasion</span> by MSS. of the Itala (<span class="ital">suasio</span>), Vulgate (<span class="ital">persuasio</span>), Erasmus, Castalio, Calvin, Beza, Cornelius a Lapide, Wolf, Michaelis, Zachariae, Koppe, Borger, Flatt, Paulus, Usteri, Schott, Hilgenfeld, Wieseler, Matthias, Holsten, and others; on the other hand, Chrysostom (<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐπὶ τούτοις ἐκάλεσεν ὑμᾶς ὁ καλῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥστε οὕτω σαλεύεσθαι</span>), Oecumenius (<span class="greekheb">τὸ πεισθῆναι τοῖς λέγουσιν ὑμῖν περιτέμνεσθαι</span>), Theophylact (<span class="greekheb">τὸ πείθεσθαι τοῖς ἀπατῶσιν</span>), Luther (1519 and 1524; but in 1538, and in his translation: <span class="ital">such persuasion</span>), and others, including Morus, Winer, Rückert, Matthies, Olshausen, Reiche, Hofmann, Reithmayr, explain it as <span class="ital">compliance</span>,[227] which, however, does not fit the word used absolutely. The latter rather yields the thought: <span class="ital">The persuasion is not of your caller</span>, is not a thing proceeding from God (see, on the contrary, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>). Paul would have this applied to the mode of operation of the pseudo-apostles, who worked upon the Galatians <span class="ital">by persuasion</span> (talking over), so that they did not remain obedient to the truth, but turned <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ καλέσαντος αὐτοὺς ἐν χάριτι Χριστοῦ</span> to an <span class="greekheb">ἕτερον εὐαγγέλιον</span> (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>). If it were to be taken as <span class="ital">compliance</span>, some more precise definition must have been appended;[228] because compliance is ungodly not in itself, but only according to the nature of the demand, the motive, and the moral circumstances generally. Some have made it to mean <span class="ital">credulitas</span> (Estius, Winer, Baumgarten-Crusius, and others), but the sense of the word is thus altered. The <span class="ital">talking over</span>, however, did not need anything added, since it is <span class="ital">of itself</span>, in matters of faith at any rate, objectionable; hence it was very superfluous in Luther, Grotius, and many others, to take the article as <span class="ital">demonstrative</span>. Moreover, the active sense is excellently adapted to the designation of God by <span class="greekheb">ὁ καλῶν ὑμᾶς</span>, inasmuch as the <span class="ital">talking over</span> is a mode of operating on men characteristically different from the divine <span class="ital">calling:</span> the former not befitting the divine dignity like the latter; the former bound up with human premeditation, art, and importunity, taking place <span class="greekheb">ἐν πειθοῖς σαφίας λόγοις</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>), counteracting free self-determination, and so forth.

Reiche, preferring the signification <span class="ital">compliance</span>, takes the sentence as <span class="ital">asking</span> indignantly: “Annon assensus, obsequium veritati praestandum e Deo est, qui vos vocavit?” But why should Paul have expressed this by the singular word <span class="greekheb">πεισμονή</span> not used by him elsewhere, and not by the current and unambiguous <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὑπακοὴ τῆς πίστεως</span>?

It is true that the dogma of his opponents was in itself fundamentally subversive (as Wieseler objects); but its <span class="ital">influence</span> had not yet so far developed itself, that the <span class="greekheb">ζύμη</span> might not have been still designated relatively as <span class="greekheb">μικρά</span>. Others interpret it as referring to <span class="ital">persons:</span> “vel pauci homines perperam docentes possunt omnem coetum corrumpere,” Winer (comp. Theodoret, Jerome, Augustine, Erasmus, Grotius, Estius, Locke, Bengel, Borger, Paulus, Usteri, Schott, de Wette, Hilgenfeld, Wieseler, Hofmann, Windischmann, Reithmayr, and others); but against this it may be urged that the <span class="ital">number</span> of the false teachers, as it is in itself a matter of indifference, and does not acquire greater significance through their having intruded themselves from without, remains also unnoticed throughout the epistle, and the point in question was solely the <span class="ital">influence of their teaching</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">πεισμονή</span>), which was the leaven threatening to spread destructively.

In vers. 5, 6 the apostle has indicated the proper character of a Christian believer's life, as one which is animated by a faith energizing through love, and by the anticipation of attaining hereafter the awards to be rendered to the justified. Compare the general strain of thought, strikingly similar to that in the present context, pursued in <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-15</a>. Obviously, one Important element in the comparison is the Christian's forward advance in self-improvement, as well as his continuing prosecution of work for Christ's cause. These characteristics had, and not long before, marked the manner of life of the Galatian Christians. Upon the recurrence of this recollection, here again, as in <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-16</a>, the apostle bewails the change that had taken place. They <span class="accented">had</span> been so full of joy and of love in believing (<a href="/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14, 15</a>). But now an incipient relinquishment of their hope in Christ had left them cheerless, and, in consequence, ready to look abroad in quest of other grounds of assured confidence; while also the thence ensuing conflicts of controversy and faction had marred their once happy mutual concord (ver. 15). The form of Christian life which the Galatian Churchmen had in those days presented to view was apparently similar to that which at an earlier date he had described as marking the Thessalonian Church (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>), and at a later time applauds in the Colossian (<a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4-6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who aid hinder you</span>; or, <span class="accented">who did drive you back</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span>]). The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus would mean, as in the margin of our English Bibles, "Who has driven [or, beaten, struck] you back," and would be illustrated by the use of the verb in Wisd. 18:23, "Standing between, he beat back the wrath," as Aaron did. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> is the reading of all recent editors. The precise meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> does not seem to be, as some suppose, "to stop," but rather "to hamper, shackle, impede." It occurs <a href="/acts/24-4.htm">Acts 24:4</a>, "be tedious;" <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>, "Satan hindered;" <a href="/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, "hindered." So the substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, "That we may cause no hindrance to [clog the success of] the gospel." Possibly this sense is derived from the hindrance caused to the traveller by the road being "cut into" or cut up before he goes over it. But it is more probably connected with the use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> in the sense of "worry," as in Demosthenes, 'Olynth.,' it. p. 22, "Worried from time to time by these expeditions up and down." So here, "Who was it that clogged your steps in running your race?" Not positively "arrested your steps:" this disastrous result, it was to be hoped, was not yet brought about; they were only as yet lagging in their course. This interrogation "who" does not so much demand that the evil worker shall be named and brought to light, as express the pity of it, that any one  should have been able to work them so much mischief; as in <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>. Nevertheless, the author of the mischief had cause to tremble (see ver. 12, and note). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should not obey the truth?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> [T.

"The truth" directly cites the gospel; that is, the gospel which proclaims righteousness as theirs who believe in Christ apart from works of the ceremonial law; comp. <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>, "That the truth of the gospel might continue with you," the particular phase of the gospel there intended being clearly evinced from the circumstances referred to. "Truth," without the article, denoting "that which is true," cites the same by implication. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, frequently rendered in the Authorized Version by "obey," as <a href="/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, properly means to lend a compliant ear to advice or persuasion; "to hearken," as <a href="/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36, 37, 40</a>; <a href="/acts/23-21.htm">Acts 23:21</a>; <a href="/acts/27-11.htm">Acts 27:11</a>. The apostle means that they were turning their ears away from the truth to listen to pernicious counsels or teaching.
