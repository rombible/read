He who allows himself to be circumcised thereby commits himself wholly to the Law, just as, it might be said, he who is baptised commits himself wholly to Christ.

Let us take heed to the warnings and persuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit, wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object of their hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sake of their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies or assert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend to them, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges or profession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God, and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of old was not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms and observances now are. But without faith working by love, all else is worthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I testify again - Probably he had stated this when he had preached the gospel to them first, and he now solemnly bears witness to the same thing again.

Circumcision was the distinguishing badge of the Jews, as baptism is of Christians. A man, therefore, who became circumcised became a professor of the Jewish religion, and bound himself to obey all its special laws. This must be understood, of course, with reference to the point under discussion; and means, if he did it with a view to justification, or as a thing that was necessary and binding. It would not apply to such a case as that of Timothy, where it was a matter of mere expediency or prudence; see the note at <a href="/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Of these the apostle saith, that by this they made themselves <span class="ital">debtors to do the whole law; </span> they were obliged to one part of the law, they must also be obliged to all the other parts of it. Besides that circumcision was an owning and professing subjection to the whole law; as the receiving the sacrament of baptism is a professed subjecting ourselves to the whole gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Objection.</span> But (may some say) ought not then all Christians to observe the law? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Not the ceremonial and political law, which were peculiar to the Jewish church and state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

But if any disclaimed Christ, (which, whosoever added any thing to his righteousness and to faith in him, as to the justification of the soul, did, as the apostle had said in the former verse), they laid themselves under an obligation to fulfil the whole law of God, if they would be saved. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For I testify again to every man,....

By receiving circumcision a man voluntarily put himself under the conditions of the law, which were, ‘fulfil perfectly and live: fail and die’. The tremendous responsibility thus incurred may have been disguised by the false Apostles: or the Galatians may have been slow to realise it. St Paul’s appeal is to the individual conscience. ‘Warning <span class="ital">every man</span> and teaching <span class="ital">every man</span>’ (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>) was his maxim as a minister of the Gospel, and it ought to be the maxim of all who claim to be successors of the Apostles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/galatians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/galatians/5-3.htm" title="For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.">Galatians 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὀφειλέτης</span>, <span class="ital">a debtor</span>) Endangering salvation.—<span class="greekheb">ὅλον</span>, <span class="ital">the whole</span>) A task which he will never be able to perform.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I testify again</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">I protest again.</span> In using the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">pro teste loquor</span>, "I speak in the presence of a witness," the apostle intimates that he is making his affirmation with a definite sense of the Lord being his Witness (cf. <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17</a>, "This I say and testify in the Lord"). The original construction and force of the verb are shown in Judith 7:28, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>. The apostle is wont to use it with a distinct sense of its emphatic import (see <a href="/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). The word "again" points, not to the substance of the subsequent affirmation, as if it were a repetition of that mode in the preceding verse, which in fact it does not appear to be, but to the solemnity with which he makes this fresh affirmation. For the phrase, "I Paul say unto you," was one form of solemn affirmation which in effect gaged his personality as Christ's apostle and as acting in his name; and this "I protest" is another of equally solemn import. <span class="cmt_word">To every man that is circumcised</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="accented">to every man that is having himself circumcised.</span> St. Paul's statements elsewhere, and his own proceeding in circumcising Timothy, as well as the present context, make it certain that, however absolute and universal his affirmation at first sight seems to be, it is nevertheless meant to be taken as made with reference to certain understood conditions. Thus: "I protest to any one of you Gentiles, who, being already baptized into Christ, has himself circumcised with the view of winning righteousness and favour with God, by obeying this one prescription of the Law - that," etc. The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> is most probably the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of transition (metabatic), introducing a fresh particular merely; and in this instance, as often, it needs not to be represented in translation at all. Certainly s for" is not its meaning. Possibly, as De Wette supposes, it points back, as an adversative, to the words," Christ shall profit you nothing," as if it were "but on the contrary." <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">he is a debtor to do the whole Law</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%ti o)feile/th</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">that he is under obligation</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">is a debtor</span>) <span class="accented">to do the whole Law.</span> By having himself circumcised, he adopts the token of the Lord's covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11, 13</a>) made with those who were his people after the flesh; he enrolls himself with them to share with them their obligations. And to them the Lord had given the Law of Mount Sinai to be their appointed <span class="accented">pedagogue</span> till the Christ should come. "By being circumcised" (he means) "you of your own accord put yourself back afresh under this pedagogue, and just <span class="accented">his</span> bidding you must do. And for what? All the ordinances and ceremonies he puts you upon observing will leave you as far off as ever from remission of sins and justification with God! And this self-surrender to the pedagogue God has not asked for at <span class="accented">your</span> hands; while what he does require, that you withhold, even faith in him whom he hath sent: nay, not merely withhold your belief, but by open act and deed testify your <span class="accented">disbelief</span> in him." Under all that the apostle is here writing there appears to lie the principle, which, however, he has not distinctly stored, but which we see to be true, that circumcision was the peculiar badge of "Israel after the flesh," appertaining to them alone  and not to be meddled with by any who did not mean to become naturalized as fellow-citizens with them.
