More often the Apostle speaks of the state of righteousness as conferred upon the Christian at his baptism. This is, however, only a sort of ideal or potential righteousness; it is a state inherent in that kingdom of which the Christian then becomes a member, not a state inherent in the Christian himself. This ideal or potential righteousness becomes real and actual only at the end of the Christian’s career, when it is finally confirmed to him. Looking forward to this point, it is an object of hope.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/galatians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/galatians/5-5.htm" title="For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith....">Galatians 5:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">For we </span>— Who believe in Christ, and are his true disciples, having been savingly enlightened in the knowledge of the truth; do, <span class="ital">through the </span>influences of the <span class="ital">Spirit </span>— Without any of these carnal ordinances; <span class="ital">wait for </span>— In sure confidence of obtaining; <span class="ital">the hope of righteousness </span>— That is, the righteousness we hope for, and the full reward of it; <span class="ital">by faith </span>— The only way in which these blessings can be attained; for it is through faith that we receive this righteousness of God, <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>; and by faith we shall obtain the reward. <span class="ital">For in Christ Jesus </span>— According to the institution which he hath established, according to the tenor of the Christian covenant, or with respect to our having an interest in and union with him; <span class="ital">neither circumcision </span>— With the most punctual observance of the law; <span class="ital">nor uncircumcision </span>— With the most exact heathen morality; <span class="ital">availeth any thing </span>— To our present justification or eternal salvation; <span class="ital">but faith </span>alone, even that faith <span class="ital">which worketh by love</span> — That persuasion of, and confidence in, the love of God to us, manifested in his giving Christ to die for us, and in pardoning and accepting us through Christ, which produces in us love to God in return; and obedience, the fruit of this love, and which worketh in us all inward holiness, and worketh by us all outward holiness. “The account which the apostle here gives us of faith,” says Macknight, “deserves attention. He does not say that it consists in the mere speculative belief of the truths of the gospel, nor in a confident persuasion, taken up any how, that we are actually justified, or that Christ hath died for us in particular. These things are nowhere in Scripture represented as constituting justifying faith; and they who trust to them delude themselves.

Let us take heed to the warnings and persuasions of the apostle to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the gospel. All true Christians, being taught by the Holy Spirit, wait for eternal life, the reward of righteousness, and the object of their hope, as the gift of God by faith in Christ; and not for the sake of their own works. The Jewish convert might observe the ceremonies or assert his liberty, the Gentile might disregard them or might attend to them, provided he did not depend upon them. No outward privileges or profession will avail to acceptance with God, without sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. True faith is a working grace; it works by love to God, and to our brethren. May we be of the number of those who, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. The danger of old was not in things of no consequence in themselves, as many forms and observances now are. But without faith working by love, all else is worthless, and compared with it other things are of small value.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we - We who are Christians.

The main idea is, not that of waiting as if the thing were delayed; it is that of expecting. The sense is, that true Christians have no other hope of salvation than by faith in the Lord Jesus. It is not by their own works, nor is it by any conformity to the Law. The object of Paul is, to show them the true nature of the Christian hope of eternal life, and to recall them from dependence on their conformity to the Law.<p>The hope of righteousness - The hope of justification.

This is a farther step than being "justified"; not only are we this, but "wait for the hope" which is connected with it, and is its full consummation. "Righteousness," in the sense of justification, is by the believer once for all already attained: but the consummation of it in future perfection above is the object of hope to be waited for: "the crown of righteousness laid up" (2Ti 4:8): "the hope laid up for you in heaven" (Col 1:5; 1Pe 1:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For we; </span> we Christians, who have truly embraced Christ; or, (as others think), we that are turned from Judaism to Christianity, and so are more concerned in the law, which was not given to the Gentiles, but to us Jews: yet, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">through the Spirit, </span> by the guidance and direction or the Spirit, or through the operation of the Spirit in us, <span class="ital">we wait for the hope of righteousness; </span> that is, we hope for righteousness; that righteousness whereby we shall be made righteous before God; or, (as some will have it), the crown of righteousness: I had rather understand it of righteousness itself, that having been all along the argument of the apostle’s discourse here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By faith; </span> not by our observance of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For we through the Spirit wait,....

In a corresponding way, the <span class="greekheb">υἱοθεσία</span>, although it has been already entered upon through faith (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>, <a href="/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>), is also the object of hope (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>). This at the same time explains why Paul <span class="ital">here</span> speaks in particular of an <span class="greekheb">ἐλπὶς δικαιοσύνης</span>; he thereby indicates the difference between the <span class="ital">certainty of salvation</span> in the consciousness (<a href="/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>) of the true Christians, and the confidence, dependent upon works, felt by the legally righteous, who say: <span class="greekheb">ἐν νόμῳ δικαιούμεθα</span>, because in their case the becoming righteous is something in a continuous <span class="ital">course of growth</span> by means of meritorious obedience to the law. Lastly, the expression <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδέχεσθαι ἐλπίδα</span> is not to be explained by the supposition that Paul, when he wrote <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίδα</span>, had it in his mind to make <span class="greekheb">ἔχομεν</span> follow (Winer, Usteri, Schott),—an interpretation which is all the more arbitrary, because there is no intervening sentence which might divert his thought,—but the hope is treated <span class="ital">objectively</span> (comp. on <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm" title="That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us:">Hebrews 6:18</a>), so that <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδέχεσθαι ἐλπίδα</span> belongs to the category of the familiar expressions <span class="greekheb">ζῆν βίον</span>, <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν δόξαν</span> (Lobeck, <span class="ital">Paralip</span>. p. 501 ff.).

We who believe are <span class="ital">now</span> perfectly righteous, ‘being made’, as the Apostle says, ‘the righteousness of God in Him’. It <span class="ital">may</span> refer to that sanctifying righteousness which is progressive, ‘inherent in us but not perfect’ (as Hooker says), the perfection of which is the aim and end of our earthly discipline. Luther understands the expression to refer either to the hope of a full assurance of justifying faith, or to the hope of complete deliverance from sin. Writing out of the fulness of his own spiritual experience he adds: ‘Either sense may well stand; but the first, touching the inward desire and affection of hoping, bringeth more plentiful consolation, for my righteousness is not yet perfect, it cannot yet be felt: yet I do not despair; for faith sheweth unto me Christ, in whom I trust, and when I have laid hold of Him by faith, I wrestle against the fiery darts of the devil, and I take a good heart through hope against the feeling of sin, assuring myself that I have a perfect righteousness prepared for me in heaven. So both these sayings are true; that I am made righteous already by that righteousness which is begun in me; and also I am raised up in the same hope against sin, and wait for the full consummation of perfect righteousness in heaven. <span class="ital">These things are not rightly understood, but when they be put in practice</span>’. But it is better to understand it of that object of hope which belongs to and arises out of our justification. By the faith which appropriates the righteousness of Christ we become sons of God and <span class="ital">heirs</span> of His everlasting kingdom. The inheritance is ‘that blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ’ (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/galatians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/galatians/5-5.htm" title="For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.">Galatians 5:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡμεῖς γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for we</span>) I and all the brethren, and as many of us as are in Christ.

The presence of this Spirit has been a]ready described as the distinguishing blessing of believers in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2-5, 14</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>); while presently after (ver. 18, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>: 22-25) the apostle dwells on the work of the same Divine Agent in regulating the Christian's habits of feeling and action (the dative as in vers. 16, 18; <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>). It is here referred to as evincing the Divine sanction which attaches to the particular action of faith and hope now to be described (comp. <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Wait</span> <span class="cmt_word">for the hope of righteousness by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">from</span> the ground <span class="accented">of faith do wait for the hope of righteousness.</span> The term which has the principal accent in this clause is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the ground of faith." This appears, both from the preceding context, in which the opposed idea of "justification by the Law" holds the foremost place, requiring here the confronting mention of "faith," and also from the next verse, which substantiates the statement before us by affirming the all-importance of "faith." In point of construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not appear to qualify "righteousness," although, from the classical text <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> (Septuagint), it is so often connected with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: but rather the whole clause, "wait for the hope of righteousness." What the apostle is now concerned to say is that it is by virtue of our faith that we look forward to hereafter receiving the hope of righteousness. This, of course, includes our being by faith justified. The word "hope" here designates the object hoped for, and not the sentiment itself. So <a href="/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>, "hope that is seen;" <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>, "the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens;"  <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, "looking for the blissful hope." The genitive, "of righteousness," may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the "genitive of apposition," the hope which is, or which consists of, righteousness, similar to the genitives in the phrases, "the earnest of the Spirit," "the sign of circumcision,' ' "the leaven of malice," "the recompense of the inheritance," "the peaceable fruit of righteousness" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the hope of righteousness" may mean the hope that appertains unto righteousness, which would be the "inheritance" spoken of in <a href="/galatians/3-18.htm">Galatians 3:18, 22</a>, as accruing, not "from the Law," but to those who are justified by faith. The apostle is not wont to speak of justification as a blessing to be received at the day of final decision, to which he evidently here refers, but as a blessing received at once by those who believe in Christ as the fruit even here of their faith. Thus <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>, "Being justified (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) by faith, we have peace with God;" ibid., ver. 11, "We have now received the reconciliation." Thus also in this Epistle (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-27</a>) it is declared that, in consequence of being justified by faith, we are clothed with Christ and God's adopted sons (see also <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>). There can surely be no question of the already received justification of those in whom the Spirit testifies that they are sons. Nor does <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a> ("That I may be found in him, having... the righteousness which is through faith in Christ" ) speak a different language: he aspires (he there says) to be in that final judgment found in possession of a righteousness which he had received in this life through the faith which he had in this life exercised. As Bengel here observes, "Paul, in mentioning things beyond, includes and confirms things present." Of Judaical legalism it was true that it did not think itself already possessed of righteousness, but with an ever-unappeased conscience was always still striving after it; whereas it is the privilege and glory of faith that it can enjoy the assurance of being even now justified and at peace with, "at one" with, God. Most certainly, what the apostle here calls "hope" is not the sentiment which we so often thus name when we intend thereby an imperfectly assured expectation of some probably coming good. In the apostle's vocabulary it denotes a confident anticipation unclouded by doubt (comp. <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23-25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). In fine, this is what the apostle means: We Christians, as led by the Spirit of adoption, do rest in the confident anticipation of receiving the inheritance which is the future award of the righteous, on the ground of our faith in the Lord Jesus. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in all the six other passages in which it is found, is used with reference to objects or events pertaining to the close of the present dispensation: <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19, 23, 25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>. The proposition <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> in this compound verb is probably intensive, expressing thorough-goingness; an entirely assured, steadfast expectation, persistent to the end. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For we (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;)<p>&#x393;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; for introduces a proof of the preceding statement, by declaring the contrary attitude of those who continue under the economy of grace.
