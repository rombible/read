The apostle urges that all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. If Christians, who should help one another, and rejoice one another, quarrel, what can be expected but that the God of love should deny his grace, that the Spirit of love should depart, and the evil spirit, who seeks their destruction, should prevail?

The meaning here is, that Paul wished the false teachers removed because true Christians had been called unto liberty, and they were abridging and destroying that liberty. They were not in subjection to the Law of Moses, or to anything else that savored of bondage. They were free; free from the servitude of sin, and free from subjection to expensive and burdensome rites and customs. They were to remember this as a great and settled principle; and so vital a truth was this, and so important that it should be maintained, and so great the evil of forgetting it, that Paul says he earnestly wishes <a href="/galatians/5-12.htm">Galatians 5:12</a> that all who would reduce them to that state of servitude were cut off from the Christian church.<p>Only use not liberty ... - The word use here introduced by our translators, obscures the sense. The idea is, "You are called to liberty, but it is not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. It is not freedom from virtuous restraints, and from the laws of God. It is liberty from the servitude of sin, and religious rites and ceremonies, not freedom from the necessary restraints of virtue." It was necessary to give this caution, because:<p>(1) There was a strong tendency in all converts from paganism to relapse again into their former habits. Licentiousness abounded, and where they had been addicted to it before their conversion, and where they were surrounded by it on every hand, they were in constant danger of falling into it again. A bare and naked declaration, therefore, that they had been called to liberty, to freedom from restraint, might have been misunderstood, and some might have supposed that they were free from all restraints.<p>(2) it is needful to guard the doctrine from abuse at all times. There has been a strong tendency, as the history of the church has shown, to abuse the doctrine of grace. The doctrine that Christians are "free;" that there is liberty to them from restraint, has been perverted always by Antinomians, and been made the occasion of their indulging freely in sin. And the result has shown that nothing was more important than to guard the doctrine of Christian liberty, and to show exactly what Christians are freed from, and what laws are still binding on them. Paul is, therefore, at great pains to show that the doctrines which he had maintained did not lead to licentiousness, and did not allow the indulgence of sinful and corrupt passions.<p>An occasion - As allowing indulgence to the flesh, or as a furtherance or help to corrupt passions; see the word explained in the notes at <a href="/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8</a>.<p>To the flesh - The word flesh is often used in the writings of Paul to denote corrupt and gross passions and affections; see the notes at <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, note.<p>But by love serve one another - By the proper manifestation of love one to another strive to promote each other's welfare. To do this will not be inconsistent with the freedom of the gospel. When there is love there is no servitude. Duty is pleasant, and offices of kindness agreeable. Paul does not consider them as freed from all law and all restraint; but they are to be governed by the law of love. They were not to feel that they were so free that they might lawfully give indulgence to the desires of the flesh, but they were to regard themselves as under the law to love one another; and thus they would fulfil the law of Christian freedom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. The "ye" is emphatical, from its position in the Greek, "Ye brethren"; as opposed to those legalists "who trouble you."<p>unto liberty&#8212;The Greek expresses, "on a footing of liberty." The state or condition in which ye have been called to salvation, is one of liberty. Gospel liberty consists in three things, freedom from the Mosaic yoke, from sin, and from slavish fear.<p>only, &c.&#8212;Translate, "Only turn not your liberty into an occasion for the flesh." Do not give the flesh the handle or pretext (Ro 7:8, "occasion") for its indulgence which it eagerly seeks for; do not let it make Christian "liberty" its pretext for indulgence (Ga 5:16, 17; 1Pe 2:16; 2Pe 2:19; Jude 4).<p>but by love serve one another&#8212;Greek, "Be servants (be in bondage) to one another." If ye must be servants, then be servants to one another in love. While free as to legalism, be bound by Love (the article in the Greek personifies love in the abstract) to serve one another (1Co 9:19). Here he hints at their unloving strifes springing out of lust of power.

He calls them "brethren", to testify his affection to them, and to put them in mind of their relation to one another, which required mutual love, a thing he is about to press them to; he asserts that they were "called" not merely externally, but internally, by the effectual grace of God, out of bondage to sin, Satan, and the law, unto the liberty of the Gospel and of the grace of God; that liberty wherewith Christ had made them free, <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a> this he said in a judgment of charity, hoping well of them: <p>only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh; corrupt nature, which in unregenerate men takes encouragement from, and makes an ill use of the best of things, as the mercy and patience of God; and not only takes an occasion by the law, forbidding sin to work and stir up all manner of concupiscence; but also by the Gospel, and the doctrines of it, such as eternal election, free justification, &amp;c. which though the source and fountain, the barrier and security, of all true and real holiness, are improved and abused by wicked minds, under the influence and instigation of Satan, to vile purposes; and though regenerate persons are not in the flesh, and do not live after it, yet that is in them, and there is a proneness in them to sin; and Satan is watching all opportunities and advantages against them; so that there is need for such a caution as this, that they do not misuse their Christian liberty by indulging the flesh and the lusts of it, which is apt to take an occasion to cherish its lusts, and especially when given: Christ's free men should not do so, for that is to disgrace the doctrine of Christian liberty, to enthral themselves in, bondage instead of using their liberty aright, and to give the enemy occasion to blaspheme: the doctrine of Christian liberty may bc abused, or used as an occasion to the flesh, and to fulfil the lusts of it; when under a pretence thereof men think themselves exempt from obedience to the civil magistrate, which is using this liberty as a cloak of maliciousness; or that they are free from obedience to the law of God, as a rule of walk and conversation; or from subjection to the ordinances of the Gospel; or when they use the creatures God has given them the free use of without thankfulness, and in an immoderate manner; and when they make things indifferent which are not, or use indifferent things to the prejudice of others; and their liberty becomes a stumblingblock to weak Christians, which the apostle seems greatly to regard here; since he adds, <p>but by love serve one another: the Vulgate Latin version reads, "by the love of the Spirit": and so some copies; Gospel liberty and the service of the saints are not at all inconsistent; as it becomes them to love one another, as the new command of Christ, their profession of religion, and their relation to each other, require, so they should show their love by their service; as by praying one with and for another, by bearing each other's burdens, sympathizing with and communicating to each other in things temporal and spiritual; in forbearing with and forgiving one another; by admonishing each other when there is occasion for it, in a meek, tender, and brotherly way; by instructing and building up one another on their most holy faith, and by stirring up one another to all the duties of religion, private and public. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty;

This, of course, was that condition of free men described at the end of the foregoing chapter, and summarized in the first verse of this chapter. This is again, even more briefly, recapitulated in the first clause of the present verse. As the summary in the first verse supplied a starting-point for the warnings against the Judaizers which have taken up the foregoing twelve verses, so this new summary furnishes the starting-point for exhortations designed to guard the evangelical doctrine against antinomian perversion, by insisting upon the moral behaviour required of those who enjoy the freedom which Christ gives. These exhortations occupy the remainder of this chapter and a part of the next. "Ye," being what ye are, believers baptized into Christ. The verb "were called" expresses a complete idea, meaning of itself without any adjunct, "called by God to be people of his own" (cf. "calleth," ver. 8, and the passages there cited). The words, "unto," or "for, freedom," supply an adjunct notion; as in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, the clause, "in one hope of your calling," does to the same verb. So again <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>," For God called us, not unto [or, 'for' ] uncleanness, but in sanctification.' 'The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, both in the passage last cited and in the present verse, denotes the condition or understanding upon which God had called them: they were "called" upon the understanding that they should be in a state of liberty. So <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "Created in Christ Jesus unto ['Greek,' for] good works." God calls us in Christ to be free in these three respects: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> free from condemnation and conscience of guiltiness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> free from pupil-age to a ceremonial institute of positive, carnal ordinances, and from bondage to a letter-Law; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> free, as consciously his children, knit to him by his adopting Spirit, which makes us partakers of his nature. <span class="cmt_word">Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">only</span>, <span class="accented">no freedom which shall be an occasion to the flesh</span>! or, <span class="accented">only</span>, make <span class="accented">not your freedom into an occasion for the flesh.</span> The noun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, being in the accusative, cannot be taken as simply a resumption of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> immediately before. In his eagerness to at once bar the antinomian's abuse of the gospel, the apostle omits the verb which should account for this accusative; and the result is a sentence which may be taken as grouping with various passages in classical Greek authors, being in fact quite a natural way of speaking in any language; such as in Demosthenes, ' Philippians,' 1. p. 45, "No ten thousand mercenaries for me! (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" Sophocles, ' Ant.,' 573, "No more loiterings! but...

In such cases it simply weakens the vivacity of the style, if we supply any verb. The alternative rendering supplies <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which is in fact found in two uncial manuscripts, F, G, or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, proposed by OEcumenius. In the former way of construing we have in thought to supply a second <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>: <a href="/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a>. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is need as <a href="/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>, etc. The sense of the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, starting-point, is well illustrated by its use, in the military language of Greece, for a "basis of operations" (cf. <a href="/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8, 11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>). Reflection at once shows us that a "<span class="accented">freedom"</span> which allows a man to obey the behests of his lower nature is only by a false use of the term capable of being grouped with that freedom wherewith Christ makes us free. It adopts out of the latter the single element of emancipation from ceremonial law and letter-Law, and lets go altogether the concomitant notions of spiritual emancipation which are of its very essence. Such an emancipation hands its victim clean over to the thraldom of sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18, 19</a>). St. Peter, in his First Epistle, addressed to a large group of Churches founded by St. Paul, including those of Galatia, has a number of passages which apparently take up sentiments and even expressions found in St. Paul's writings (see <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>), as it were, ratifying them; and possibly he has an eye to the present verse when he writes (<a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>), "as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of <span class="accented">wickedness</span>, but as bond-servants of God." "The flesh" is not to have its own way, but is to own the mastery of the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">But by love serve one another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but through love be in bondage to one another</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let love make you bondservants to one another. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> also means "do acts of bond-service,' as <a href="/ephesians/6-7.htm">Ephesians 6:7</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>. This sense is included in the "being in bondage ' here spoken cf. In the present posture of affairs in these Churches, the apostle sees occasion for selecting just here one particular branch of Christian goodness to enforce upon their observance. Presently after (vers. 16-20 he enlarges the field of view; though even there still giving much prominence to the vices of malignity and to the benignant virtues. Just now he has his eye especially on the evils of contentiousness (ver. 15), and upon love as their corrective. We may  suppose such evils were now especially rife amongst the Galatians, whose natural character, commonly described as quarrelsome, was apparently evincing itself in connection with the disputes which the teaching and yet more the outward action of the Judaizers were giving rise to. In fact, a loving temper of mind, along with other benefits, is recommended also by this, that it guards Churches from corrupting innovations in doctrine and Church practice; checking our self-will and our obtrusive vanity, it leads us to avoid giving uneasiness to others by thrusting upon them new notions or new modes of conduct, and makes it our ambition to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. The pattern set by our Lord (<a href="/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>), both in washing his disciples' feet and indeed in his whole incarnate life (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>), was grandly imitated by the apostle himself (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>), who in outward things habitually sacrificed the pride of independence and self-assertion, and the pride of apparent self-consistency, in his devotion to the spiritual welfare of men.
