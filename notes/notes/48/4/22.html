Hagar was an Egyptian slave in the house of Abraham. God having promised to Abraham that in his seed all nations should be blessed, Sarah, becoming impatient because the fulfilment of the promise was delayed, gave Hagar as a concubine to her husband. This resulted in the birth of Ishmael (<a href="/context/genesis/16-1.htm" title="Now Sarai Abram's wife bore him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar....">Genesis 16:1-3</a>; <a href="/genesis/16-15.htm" title="And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.">Genesis 16:15</a>.)

Attention has been drawn to other sons born of Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25-1.htm">Genesis 25:1, 2</a>), who both in ancient and in modern days (see Windisch-mann) have been very plausibly interpreted as analogously pointing forward allegorically to those heretical bodies, now vanished, which threatened such danger to the Church in the first centuries. But the apostle's concern here is exclusively with the posture of affairs subsisting at the time of Hagar's and Ishmael's expulsion from the patriarch's family, quoted in ver. 30 from <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>. Even if he had seen fit by allegorical exposition to apply Scripture to those dire forms of utterly perverted Christianity, which he certainly did look forward to as about to arise, it is very questionable whether he would have conceded to them so venerable a parentage as having Abraham for their forefather. Mosaism in its place was a thing of Divine origin, even as Christianity itself was, both of them "covenants" of God; not so the monstrous forms of Gnostic and Manichean teaching which horrified the primitive Church. In fact, typology, that is to say, the interpretation of Old Testament Scripture as bearing a <span class="accented">designed</span> allegorical sense, requires very cautious handling. The tracing of analogies is an interesting and pleasing exercise of theological ingenuity; but it is one thing to trace a parallelism, and a quite different thing to detect a latent predictive sense intended by the Holy Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">The one by a bondmaid</span> (<span class="greek_word">e%na e)k th  =   paidi/skh</span>); <span class="accented">one by the handmaid</span>; the expression pointing to the individual mother known from the sacred history. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in classical Greek means a girl either slave or free. In the Septuagint it is generally a slave (not, however, in <a href="/ruth/4-12.htm">Ruth 4:12</a>, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">na'arah</span>); in the New Testament it is always a maidservant. St. Paul borrows the word from the Septuagint of <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>. and 21, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">shiphehah.</span> Hagar was the personal property of Sarah. <span class="cmt_word">The other by a freewoman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and one by the freewoman.</span> The word "freewoman" is never applied to Sarah in the story in Genesis; not even in the passage freely quoted in ver. 30; but it was an obviously true description, and with perfect fairness introduced in antithesis to Hagar. As applied to one holding so princessly a position in the story as Sarah, the idea of a freewoman stands coloured with a deep tincture of dignity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;)<p>Your determination to be under the law is opposed by Scripture, if you will understand it, for it is written, etc.<p>A bondmaid (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>The bondmaid, indicating a well known character, Hagar, <a href="/genesis/16-3.htm">Genesis 16:3</a>.
