It has been suggested that they have reference to a special code current in Galatia. It is, however, far more probable that the Apostle is referring exclusively to neither, but has in his mind a sort of abstraction of the law of minority, such as would present itself to one who had not himself had a legal education.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now I</span> <span class= "bld">say.</span>—This phrase introduces a further and fuller explanation of what is involved in the state of nonage, as compared with that of adult freedom.<p><span class= "bld">A child</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an infant, a minor; though the term <span class= "ital">is</span> not technically chosen.<p><span class= "bld">Differeth nothing from a servant.</span>—Both the child and the slave were incapable of any valid act in a legal sense; the guardian was as entirely the representative of the one as the master of the other.

This, however, is a point that does not really enter into the Apostle’s thoughts. The illustration does not hold good in <span class= "ital">all</span> particulars, but in the <span class= "ital">chief</span> particulars—viz., the state of constraint and subordination in which the minor is placed so long as he is a minor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/galatians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;...">Galatians 4:1-3</a></span>. The apostle, having established the consolatory doctrine that believers, in every age and country of the world, are heirs of the promises made to Abraham and to his seed, goes on in this chapter to answer an inquiry which he knew would naturally occur to his readers, but which, according to his manner, he does not formally state; namely, Since all believers, from the beginning, were heirs of the promises, as well as of the things promised, why were they not put in possession of the promises from the beginning, by sending Christ into the world, and introducing the gospel dispensation in the first age; that the promises, especially the promise of pardon and eternal life through faith, might have been published universally, and preserved for the benefit of the heirs in every age; and why were mankind left for so many ages to the direction of the laws of nature and of Moses, neither of which gave them any hope of pardon and eternal life? To this inquiry the apostle answers, that in not giving the heirs the knowledge of the promises, by introducing the gospel dispensation immediately after the fall, God treated them as a prudent father treats his son while under age. During his nonage, he does not allow him to possess the estate, of which he is the heir, because he has not discretion to use it aright; but keeps him in the condition of a bond-man. In the same manner, though believers from the beginning were heirs of the promises, God did not, in the early ages, put them in possession of them, by immediately setting up the gospel dispensation; because, in the first ages, the state of the world did not admit of either the universal publication of the gospel, or of its preservation. And that, as the heir of a great estate must be prepared by a proper education for managing and enjoying it, and is therefore in his childhood placed under persons who instruct him, manage his estate, and supply him with necessaries, till the time appointed in his father’s will for taking possession of his inheritance; so, to prepare believers for the actual inheritance of the gospel dispensation, God judged it proper to continue them for a long time under the bondage of the laws of nature, and of the patriarchal and Mosaic dispensations, that by experiencing the hardships of that bondage, they might be the more sensible of the happiness which they were to derive from the liberty of the gospel. This is the sense of the three first verses, as appears by the following short paraphrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Now </span>— To illustrate, by a plain similitude, the pre-eminence of the Christian over the legal dispensation; <span class="ital">I say that the heir </span>— Of any estate, however large; <span class="ital">as long as he is a child </span>— Or is under age; <span class="ital">differeth nothing from a servant </span>— With respect to the free use and enjoyment of his estate; <span class="ital">though he be lord of all </span>— Proprietor of it all, by right of inheritance; <span class="ital">but is </span>placed <span class="ital">under tutors </span>— As to his person; <span class="ital">and governors</span> — <span class="greekheb">Οικονομους</span>, <span class="ital">stewards, </span>as to his substance; <span class="ital">until the time appointed of the father </span>— When he shall be deemed of age, and be at liberty to manage his affairs himself. <span class="ital">So we </span>— The church of God, heirs of the promises; <span class="ital">when we were children </span>— In our minority, were not put in possession of the promises, by the introduction of the gospel dispensation, but, to fit us for it, <span class="ital">were </span>placed <span class="ital">in bondage </span>— In a kind of servile state; <span class="ital">under the elements of the world </span>— Under the typical observances of the patriarchal and Mosaic dispensations, which were like the first elements of grammar, the ABC of children; and were of so gross a nature as hardly to carry men’s thoughts beyond this world. Seeing the apostle, in the close of the preceding chapter, declared that all who have put on Christ, (see on <a href="/context/galatians/4-27.htm" title="For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bore not; break forth and cry, you that travail not: for the desolate has many more children than she which has an husband....">Galatians 4:27-29</a>,) whether they be Jews or Gentiles, are Christ’s brethren, and heirs according to God’s promise, “it is evident that in this chapter, when he speaks concerning the heir, and describes the treatment which, by his father’s appointment, he receives during his minority, his discourse cannot be restricted to the Jews, as if they were the only heirs, but must comprehend the Gentiles also, describing their condition under the discipline of the law of nature, <a href="/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods.">Galatians 4:8</a>. In like manner the persons in bondage to the elements of the world, (<a href="/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>,) and under the law, (<a href="/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>,) who are said to be bought off by Christ, (<a href="/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>,) must be the Gentiles as well as the Jews; because Jews and Gentiles equally were under the discipline [and curse] of law. And having been bought off by Christ, (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>,) they were both of them, after his death, placed under the gospel dispensation, which is the discipline of sons. See <a href="/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-7 The apostle deals plainly with those who urged the law of Moses together with the gospel of Christ, and endeavoured to bring believers under its bondage. They could not fully understand the meaning of the law as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, so of bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, by which they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors and governors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospel dispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love and mercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also, the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by nature children of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children of love, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he will have all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir; but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. May the temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the Holy Spirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now I say - He had before said <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-25</a> that while they were under the Law they were in a state of minority. This sentiment he proceeds further to illustrate by showing the true condition of one who was a minor.<p>That the heir - Any heir to an estate, or one who has a prospect of an inheritance. No matter how great is the estate; no matter how wealthy his father; no matter to how elevated a rank he may be raised on the moment that he enters on his inheritance, yet until that time he is in the condition of a servant.<p>As long as he is a child - Until he arrives at the age. The word rendered "child" (&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  ne&#772;pioi) properly means an infant; literally, "one not speaking" (&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  ne&#772; insep. un, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  epos), and hence, a child or babe, but without any definite limitation - Robinson. It is used as the word "infant" is with us in law, to denote "a minor."<p>Differeth nothing from a servant - That is, he has no more control of his property; he has it not at his command. This does not mean that he does not differ in any respect, but only that in the matter under consideration he does not differ. He differs in his prospects of inheriting the property, and in the affections of the father, and usually in the advantages of education, and in the respect and attention shown him. but in regard to property, he does not differ, and he is like a servant, under the control and direction of others.<p>Though he be lord of all - That is, in prospect. He has a prospective right to all the property, which no one else has. The word "lord" here (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kurios), is used in the same sense in which it is often in the Scriptures, to denote master or owner. The idea which this is designed to illustrate is, that the condition of the Jews before the coming of the Messiah was inferior in many respects to what the condition of the friends of God would be under him - as inferior as the condition of an heir was before he was of age, to what it would be when he should enter on his inheritance. The Jews claimed, indeed, that they were the children or the sons of God, a title which the apostle would not withhold from the pious part of the nation; but it was a condition in which they had not entered on the full inheritance, and which was far inferior to that of those who had embraced the Messiah, and who were admitted to the full privileges of sonship. They were indeed heirs. They were interested in the promises. But still they were in a condition of comparative servitude, and could be made free only by the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>Ga 4:1-31.

And when that protection and overseeing which was but for a time is ended, we would at length come to be at our own liberty, and would live as children, and not as servants. Moreover, he shows along the way, that the governance of the Law was as it were the basics, and as certain principles, in comparison with the doctrine of the Gospel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;">Galatians 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">λέγω δέ</span>] Comp. <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.">Galatians 5:16</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:12</a> : <span class="ital">now I mean</span>, in reference to this <span class="greekheb">κληρονομία</span> brought in through Christ, the idea of which I have now more exactly to illustrate to you as for the first time realized in Christ.

THERE WERE IN THE GENTILE WORLD ALSO BEFORE CHRIST CHILDREN OF GOD IN BONDAGE TO HUMAN RULE, THAT KNEW NOT THE UNSEEN FATHER IN HEAVEN WHO WAS ORDERING THEIR LIVES. THEY WERE LIKE ORPHAN CHILDREN, WHOM A DEPARTED FATHER HAS WITH LOVING CARE CONSIGNED DURING CHILDHOOD TO THE CHARGE OF GUARDIANS AND STEWARDS. IN DUE TIME, HOWEVER, GOD SENT FORTH HIS SON TO REDEEM THEM ALSO FROM BONDAGE, AND HAS MADE US SONS AND HEIRS, SENDING FORTH THE SPIRIT OF HIS SON INTO OUR HEARTS.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In dealing with the relation of the Mosaic Law to the antecedent covenant and with its subsequent fulfilment in Christ, the Apostle necessarily limited his view of the seed of Abraham, who were covenanted heirs of salvation between Moses and the Advent, to Israel. He likened these accordingly to children growing up in their father’s house under domestic control. But as most of those to whom he wrote had been converts from heathenism, he now extends his view of the world before Christ so as to embrace Gentiles also within its scope. Amidst the heathen were other children of God, a faithful seed, potential heirs of salvation, who passed through a like stage of spiritual childhood under different conditions. They were like orphan children committed by the watchful care of an unseen and unknown father to the custody of others. For they were subject to human systems of religion, government and law, neither knowing their Heavenly Father nor comprehending His love for them. The conception of a dead father providing by his will for the due education of his orphan children serves admirably to illustrate the mutual relations between God and the Gentile world, and to set forth the combination of steadfast love on one side with utter ignorance on the other. The illustration is obviously borrowed from testamentary systems prevailing among Greeks and Romans (not among Hebrews) which enabled a father to appoint guardians for his orphan children during their minority. These testamentary powers differed considerably in different parts of the Roman world according to the municipal laws of various cities. Whereas Roman citizens became wards of the state at fourteen, so that the powers of testamentary guardians were strictly limited, the discretion of the father was allowed a wider range in Greek cities. At Athens, for instance, the guardians of Demosthenes retained control over his property till he became a full citizen after eighteen; and in Asiatic Greece the custody of property was sometimes prolonged to twenty-five, though the personal authority ceased at fourteen. The dependent position of an orphan is described in popular language without legal precision; <span class="greekheb">νήπιος</span> is not a legal term, but an appropriate description for a child of tender years, naturally subject to the control of guardians (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιτρόπους</span>) and subordinate agents whom they might employ for household management or care of property (<span class="greekheb">οἰκονόμους</span>). It can hardly be right to identify the latter with the Roman <span class="ital">curatores</span>, for the special function of these officers was custody of property and not personal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. The word ‘heirs’ at the end of the preceding chapter suggests another illustration. In human affairs the condition of a minor is antecedent to the enjoyment of the liberty and the civil rights which accrue to him on coming of age. He is a son and an heir, but during minority his position is that of a slave.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Now I say</span>] This is my meaning, comp. ch. <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a child</span>] lit. ‘an infant’, the legal term to designate ‘a minor’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">differeth nothing from a servant</span>] rather, <span class="bld">from a slave</span>. It is doubtful whether this description (continued in <span class="ital"><a href="/galatians/4-2.htm" title="But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.">Galatians 4:2</a></span>) applies to a minor under Roman or Jewish or Colonial (Galatian) law. Cæsar says that among the Gallic tribes a father had power of life and death over wife and children (<span class="ital">B. G.</span> vi. 9). It would seem from a passage in Gaius (<span class="ital">Inst</span>. 1. 55[28]) that by a local law a Galatian father had this exceptional power. We may however regard St Paul’s description as generally applicable to the condition of a minor without reference to any particular code.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] Bp Lightfoot considers that ‘this view seems to rest on a mistaken interpretation’ of the words of Gaius. It is however maintained by an eminent living jurist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">though he be lord of all</span>] Though, unlike the slave, he is lord of all, lord, by right of ultimate succession, whether his father be living or dead. Our Lord uses a similar figure, <a href="/john/8-35.htm" title="And the servant stays not in the house for ever: but the Son stays ever.">John 8:35</a>, ‘The slave abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth ever.

A form of expression usual with the apostle when introducing a new statement designed either to explain or elucidate something before said (cf. <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>, according to the Received Text; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>. So <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>). It is intended apparently to quicken attention: "Now I wish to say this." In the present case the apostle designs to throw further light upon the position taken in <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, that God's people, while under the Law, were under a bondage from which they have now been emancipated. Compare the somewhat similar process of illustration adopted in <a href="/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2-4</a>. In both passages it is not a logical demonstration that is put forward, but an illustratively analogous case in human experience. A metaphor, though not strictly an argument, yet frequently helps the reader to an intuitive perception of the justness of the position laid down. <span class="cmt_word">That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">so long as the heir is a child</span>, <span class="accented">he differeth nothing from a bondservant</span>, <span class="accented">though he is lord of all.</span> The article before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, heir, is the class article, as before <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, mediator (<a href="/galatians/3-20.htm">Galatians 3:20</a>) - "an heir." In the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the apostle evidently has in view one who as yet is in his nonage - as in English law phrase, "an infant."

In Attic Greek, the correlate to one registered amongst "men" was a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. It does not appear that the apostle means to use a technical legal expression. He contrasts <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>.
