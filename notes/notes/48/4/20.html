His meaning is, either that be wished he was personally present among them; that he had but an opportunity of seeing them face to face, and telling them all his mind, and in such a manner as he could not in a single epistle; or that they would consider him, when they read this epistle, as if he was really among them; and as if they saw the concern of his mind, the agonies of his soul, the looks of his countenance, and heard the different tone of his voice: <p>and to change my voice; when present with them, either by a different way of preaching; that whereas before he preached the Gospel of the grace of God unto them, and his voice was charming to them like that of an angel, and even of Jesus Christ himself; but they having turned their backs upon it, and slighted it, he would now thunder out the law to them they seemed to be so fond of; even that voice of words, which when, the Israelites on Mount Sinai heard, entreated they might hear no more; as these Galatians also must when they heard the true voice of it, which is no other than a declaration of wrath, curse, and damnation; or by using a different way of speaking to them, as necessity might require, either softly or roughly, beseeching or chiding them, which might more move and affect them than an epistle could: <p>for I stand in doubt of you, The Vulgate Latin reads it, "I am confounded in you"; and the Syriac,  "I am stupefied"; and to the same sense the Arabic. He was ashamed of them for their apostasy and degeneracy; he was amazed and astonished at their conduct; or, as the word may be rendered, be was "perplexed" on their account; he did not know what to think of them, and their state; sometimes he hoped well of them, at other times he was ready to despair; nor did he well know what course to take with them, whether to use them roughly or smoothly, and what arguments might be most proper and pertinent, in order to reclaim them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I desire to be present with you now, and to <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</span><p>(t) Use other words among you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-20.htm" title="I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.">Galatians 4:20</a>.

Hofmann also erroneously holds that Paul means the (in oral expression) <span class="ital">more chastened tone</span> of a <span class="ital">didactic statement</span>—aiming at the bringing the readers back from their error—after the strongly excited style in which, since the word <span class="greekheb">θαυμάζω</span> in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>, he had urged his readers, as one who had already been almost deprived of the fruit of his labours. As if Paul had not previously, and especially from <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a> to <a href="/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>, written didactically enough; and as if he had not also in the sequel (see immediately, <a href="/galatians/4-21.htm" title="Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?">Galatians 4:21</a>, and chap. 5 and 4 down to the abrupt dismissal at the end) urged his readers with excitement enough! The supposition, however, which Hofmann entertains, that Paul has hitherto been answering a <span class="ital">letter</span> of the Galatians, and has just at this point <span class="ital">come to the end of it</span>, is nothing but a groundless hypothesis, for there is no trace of such a letter to be found in the epistle. No; when Paul was for the second time in Galatia, he had spoken sharply and sternly, and this had made his readers suspect him, as if he had become their enemy (<a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>): hence he wishes to be now with them, and <span class="ital">to speak to them with a voice different from what he had then used</span>, that is, to speak to them in a <span class="ital">soft and gentle tone</span>.[209] By this, of course, he means not any deviation in the substance of his teaching from the <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύειν</span> (<a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>), but a manner of language betokening tender, mother-like love. A wish of self-denying affection, which is ready and willing, in the service of the cause and for the salvation of the persons concerned, to change form and tone, although retaining <span class="greekheb">φωνὰν ψευδέων ἀγνωστόν</span> (Pind. <span class="ital">Ol</span>. vi. 112). The latter was a matter of course in the case of a Paul, willingly though he became all things to all men; comp. on <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>. Many other expositors, as Theodoret, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Estius, Koppe, Borger, Winer, Matthies, Schott, de Wette, understand it as: <span class="ital">to speak according to the circumstances of each case, with tenderness and affection to one, with severity and censure to another</span>. Comp. Corn. a Lapide: “ut scilicet quasi mater nunc blandirer, nunc gemerem, nunc obsecrarem, nunc objurgarem vos.” But this cannot be expressed by the <span class="ital">mere</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξαι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φ</span>., which without addition means nothing more than <span class="ital">to change</span> the voice (comp. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάττειν χώραν</span>, Plat. <span class="ital">Parm</span>. p. 139 A; <span class="greekheb">εἶδος</span>, Eur. <span class="ital">Bacch</span>. 53; <span class="greekheb">χρῶμα</span>, Eur. <span class="ital">Phoen</span>. 1252; <span class="greekheb">στολάς</span>, <a href="/genesis/35-2.htm" title="Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:">Genesis 35:2</a>), that is, to assume <span class="ital">another</span> voice, to let oneself be heard <span class="ital">otherwise</span>, not <span class="ital">differently</span>. See Artem. ii. 20, iv. 56; Dio Chrysostom, lix. p. 575, in Wetstein. Comp. <a href="/romans/1-23.htm" title="And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.">Romans 1:23</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/4-11.htm" title="Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.">Wis 4:11</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/12-10.htm" title="But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little, thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that their cogitation would never be changed.">Wis 12:10</a>; frequently in the LXX. Paul must have added either a more precise definition, such as <span class="greekheb">εἰς πολλοὺς τρόπους</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς μορφὰς πλείονας</span> (Lucian, <span class="ital">Vit. Auct</span>. 5), or at least some such expression as <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν χρείαν</span> (<a href="/acts/28-10.htm" title="Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.">Acts 28:10</a>), <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸ συμφέρον</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with.">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>), <span class="greekheb">πρὸς διάκρισιν καλοῦ τε καὶ κακοῦ</span> (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>). Fritzsche incorrectly interprets it: <span class="ital">to adopt some other voice, so that ye may believe that ye are listening to some other teacher, and not to the hated Paul</span>. What a strange, unseemly idea, not at all in keeping with the thoughtful manner of the apostle! According to Wieseler, the sense intended is: <span class="ital">to exchange my speaking with you;</span> that is, to enter into <span class="ital">mutual discourse</span> with you, in order most surely to learn and to obviate your counter-arguments. But in this view “<span class="ital">with you</span>” is a pure interpolation, although it would be essentially requisite to the definition of the sense; and <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάσσειν λόγους</span>, to say nothing of <span class="greekheb">ἀλλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φωνήν</span>, is never so used. What Wieseler means is expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀμείβεσθαί τινα λόγοις</span> (Hom. <span class="ital">Od</span>. iii. 148, <span class="ital">et al</span>.), <span class="greekheb">προσδιαλέγεσθαί τινι</span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Theaet</span>. p. 161 B), <span class="greekheb">συζητεῖν τινι</span>, or <span class="greekheb">πρός τινα</span> (<a href="/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a>; <a href="/luke/22-23.htm" title="And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.">Luke 22:23</a>), <span class="greekheb">λόγους ἀντιβάλλειν πρός</span> (<a href="/luke/24-17.htm" title="And he said to them, What manner of communications are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?">Luke 24:17</a>), <span class="greekheb">δοῦναί τε καὶ ἀποδέξασθαι λόγον</span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Rep</span>. p. 531 E).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἀποροῦμαι ἐν ὑμῖν</span>] justifies the wish of <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξαι τὴν φων</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span>. The usual interpretation is the correct one: <span class="ital">I am perplexed about you</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> is to be taken as in the phrase <span class="greekheb">θαῤῥῶ ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/7-16.htm" title="I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>, so that the perplexity is conceived as inherent in the readers, dependent on their condition as its cause (comp. also <a href="/galatians/1-24.htm" title="And they glorified God in me.">Galatians 1:24</a>). The perplexity consists in this, that he at the time knows no certain ways and means by which he shall effect their re-conversion (<a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>); and this instils the wish (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) that he could now be present with them, and, in place of the severe tone which at the preceding visit had had no good effect (<a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>), could try the experiment of an altered and milder tone. The form <span class="greekheb">ἀποροῦμαι</span> is, moreover (comp. <span class="greekheb">ἀπορηθείς</span>, Dem. 830. 2, and <span class="greekheb">ἀπορηθήσεται</span>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/18-7.htm" title="When a man hath done, then he beginneth; and when he leaveth off, then he shall be doubtful.">Sir 18:7</a>), to be taken <span class="ital">passively</span> (as a middle form with a passive signification), so that the state of the <span class="greekheb">ἀπορεῖν</span> is conceived of as produced on the subject, passively (Schoemann, <span class="ital">ad Isaeum</span>, p. 192). Fritzsche, <span class="ital">l.c</span>. p. 257, holds the sense to be: “<span class="ital">Nam haeretis, quo me loco habeatis, nam sum vobis suspectus</span>.” Thus <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> would be <span class="ital">among you</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἀποροῦμαι</span>: <span class="ital">I am an object of perplexity</span>, according to the well-known Greek use of the personal passive of intransitive verbs (Bernhardy, p. 341; Kühner, II. p. 34 f.). Comp. Xen. <span class="ital">de rep. Lac</span>. xiii. 7: <span class="greekheb">ὥστε τῶν δεομένων γίγνεσθαι οὐδὲν ἀπορεῖται</span>, Plat. <span class="ital">Soph</span>. p. 243 B, <span class="ital">Legg</span>. vii. p. 799 C. But the sense: “sum vobis <span class="ital">suspectus</span>” is <span class="ital">interpolated</span>, and there is no ground for deviating from the use of <span class="greekheb">ἀποροῦμαι</span> throughout the N.T. (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>; <a href="/luke/24-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:">Luke 24:4</a>; <a href="/acts/25-20.htm" title="And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.">Acts 25:20</a>; <a href="/john/13-22.htm" title="Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.">John 13:22</a>); as, indeed, the idea “<span class="ital">sum vobis suspectus</span>” cannot give any suitable motive for the wish of the <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξαι τὴν φωνήν</span>, unless we adopt Fritzsche’s erroneous interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξαι</span>. To disconnect (with Hofmann) <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> from <span class="greekheb">ἀποροῦμαι</span>, and attach it to <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φωνήν μου</span>, would yield an addition entirely superfluous after <span class="greekheb">παρεῖναι πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span>, and leave <span class="greekheb">ἀποροῦμαι</span> without any more precise definition of its bearing. And the proposal to attach <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἀπορ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> as protasis to the following <span class="greekheb">λέγετέ μοι</span> (Matthias) would have the effect of giving to the <span class="greekheb">λέγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μοι</span>, which stands forth sternly and peremptorily, an enfeebling background.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[208] So also Zachariae (who is followed by Flatt): “to lay aside my present mournful language, and to adopt that of tenderness and contentment.” In this case Paul must have used <span class="greekheb">δύνασθαι</span>; for unless his readers had improved in their conduct, it would have been <span class="ital">impossible</span> for him to speak contentedly. Bengel, in opposition to the idea of <span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξαι</span>: “molliter scribit, sed mollius loqui vellet.” Jerome explained the passage as referring to the exchange of the <span class="ital">vox epistolica</span> for the <span class="ital">vivus sermo</span> of actual presence, which might have more effect in bringing them back <span class="ital">ad veritatem</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[209] Not exactly <span class="ital">weeping</span>, as Chrysostom thinks: <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι καὶ δακρύα καὶ πάντα εἰς θρῆνον ἐπισπάσασθαι</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/galatians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-20.htm" title="I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.">Galatians 4:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἤθελον</span>. This imperfect expresses a modified wish, qualified by implied conditions, like <span class="greekheb">ηὐχόμην</span> in <a href="/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a> and <span class="greekheb">ἐβουλόμην</span> in <a href="/acts/25-22.htm" title="Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself.

He would fain be with them now (<span class="greekheb">ἄρτι</span>) instead of waiting for some future opportunity, were it not that he was unavoidably detained by other claims.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξαι</span>. This is interpreted by some as a threat of increased severity, by others as a craving for the use of gentler words; but neither interpretation agrees with the regular Greek usage of the word. The natural meaning of the Greek expression is to exchange the voice for some other means of persuasion, in this case for the pen, and this sense is clearly indicated by the context. Paul longs to come and speak to them instead of writing, and is confident of his power to clear away doubts and errors by personal intercourse.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποροῦμαι</span>.

Mr Wood contends for a different explanation. He considers that St Paul’s intention in writing this Epistle, was that ‘by another’s voice he might speak to them without delay’. He understands the presence to be ‘a presence in spirit’ as in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>.

Paul aimed at the greatest ease in speaking to the Galatians. He accommodated his discourse as much as possible to the dulness of the Galatians, with a view to convince them. The doctrine of inspiration is not endangered by this fact; see <a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>, note.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I desire to be present with you now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">I could wish to be present with you this very hour.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> marks here simply a transition to another thought, and, as is not unfrequently the case, and as our Authorized Version assumes, needs not to be represented in translation at all. Bishop Lightfoot writes, "<span class="accented">But</span>, speaking of my presence, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">would I had been present</span>," etc. But this explanation is not necessary. The imperfect verb <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, like the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22</a> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, denotes a movement as it were which had just been stirring in the mind, but which for good reasons is now withdrawn: "I could almost wish -  but long distance and pressure of other duties make it impossible." Thus much in explanation of the withdrawal of the wish. The wish itself was occasioned by the feeling that the yearning desire of his soul might perhaps be more likely to be achieved if, by being on the spot, he were enabled to adapt his treatment to a more distinct consciousness of the circumstances than he can possibly now have. "To be present with you;" the very words are repeated from ver. 18. It was well both with you and with me when I was with you: would that I could be with van now I (On <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,," this very hour," see note on ch. 1:9.) <span class="cmt_word">And to change my voice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The tense of the infinitive  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> hardly allows us to take the word as meaning "from moment to moment according to the rapidly varying emergencies." This would have been expressed rather by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The question then arises - Change: from what to what? to which a great variety of answers have been proposed. The clue is probably supplied in the words, "be present with you this very hour." This <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, contrasting as it does the very present with the former occasions on which the apostle had been with them, suggests that he meant that the tone of his utterance would need to be different if amongst them just now from what it had then been. Then, it was the simple, un-anxious, joyous, exposition of the blessed gospel, untrammelled by fear of being misunderstood; such a way of speaking as one would be naturally drawn on to pursue who found himself addressing those whom he could confide in, and who were disposed frankly and lovingly, with an honest and good heart, to drink in from his lips the simple faith. Perhaps he might now find it necessary to replace that mode of utterance by guarded words, by stern reasoning, by the refuting of wilful misconceptions, by exposing and abashing cavil and objection. <span class="cmt_word">For I stand in doubt of you</span>; or, I <span class="accented">am perplexed for you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">am perplexed about you.</span> Compare <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I am in good courage concerning you" (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-16.htm">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>). As "<span class="accented">in"</span> the Corinthians the apostle found ground for good courage, so "in" the Galatians he found ground for perplexity. This explains his wishing that he were with them.
