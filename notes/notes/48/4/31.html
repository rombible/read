So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free. If the privileges of all believers were so great, according to the new covenant, how absurd for the Gentile converts to be under that law, which could not deliver the unbelieving Jews from bondage or condemnation! We should not have found out this allegory in the history of Sarah and Hagar, if it had not been shown to us, yet we cannot doubt it was intended by the Holy Spirit. It is an explanation of the subject, not an argument in proof of it. The two covenants of works and grace, and legal and evangelical professors, are shadowed forth. Works and fruits brought forth in a man's own strength, are legal. But if arising from faith in Christ, they are evangelical. The first covenant spirit is of bondage unto sin and death. The second covenant spirit is of liberty and freedom; not liberty to sin, but in and unto duty. The first is a spirit of persecution; the second is a spirit of love. Let those professors look to it, who have a violent, harsh, imposing spirit, towards the people of God. Yet as Abraham turned aside to Hagar, so it is possible a believer may turn aside in some things to the covenant of works, when through unbelief and neglect of the promise he acts according to the law, in his own strength; or in a way of violence, not of love, towards the brethren. Yet it is not his way, not his spirit to do so; hence he is never at rest, till he returns to his dependence on Christ again. Let us rest our souls on the Scriptures, and by a gospel hope and cheerful obedience, show that our conversation and treasure are indeed in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So then, brethren - It follows from all this. Not from the allegory regarded as an argument - for Paul does not use it thus - but from the considerations suggested on the whole subject. Since the Christian religion is so superior to the Jewish; since we are by it freed from degrading servitude, and are not in bondage to rites and ceremonies; since it was designed to make us truly free, and since by that religion we are admitted to the privileges of sons, and are no longer under laws, and tutors, and governors, as if we were minors; from all this it follows, that we should feel and act, not as if we were children of a bondwoman, and born in slavery, but as if we were children of a freewoman, and born to liberty. It is the birthright of Christians to think, and feel, and act like freemen, and they should not allow themselves to become the slaves of customs, and rites, and ceremonies, but should feel that they are the adopted children of God.<p>Thus closes this celebrated allegory - an allegory that has greatly perplexed most expositors, and most readers of the Bible. In view of it, and of the exposition above, there are a few remarks which may not inappropriately be made.<p>(1) it is by no means affirmed, that the history of Hagar and Sarah in Genesis, had any original reference to the gospel. The account there is a plain historical narrative, not designed to have any such reference.<p>(2) the narrative contains important principles, that may be used as illustrating truth, and is so used by the apostle Paul. There are parallel points between the history and the truths of religion, where the one may be illustrated by the other.<p>(3) the apostle does not use it at all in the way of argument, or as if that proved that the Galatians were not to submit to the Jewish rites and customs. It is an illustration of the comparative nature of servitude and freedom, and would, therefore, illustrate the difference between a servile compliance with Jewish rites, and the freedom of the gospel.<p>(4) this use of an historical fact by the apostle does not make it proper for us to turn the Old Testament into allegory, or even to make a very free use of this mode of illustrating truth. That an allegory may be used sometimes with advantage, no one can doubt while the "Pilgrim's Progress" shall exist. Nor can anyone doubt that Paul has here derived, in this manner, an important and striking illustration of truth from the Old Testament. But no one acquainted with the history of interpretation can doubt that vast injury has been done by a fanciful mode of explaining the Old Testament; by making every fact in its history an allegory; and every pin and pillar of the tabernacle and the temple a type. Nothing is better suited to bring the whole science of interpretation into contempt; nothing dishonors the Bible more, than to make it a book of enigmas, and religion to consist in puerile conceits. The Bible is a book of sense; and all the doctrines essential to salvation are plainly revealed. It should be interpreted, not by mere conceit and by fancy, but by the sober laws according to which are interpreted other books. It should be explained, not under the influence of a vivid imagination, but under the influence of a heart imbued with a love of truth, and by an understanding disciplined to investigate the meaning of words and phrases, and capable of rendering a reason for the interpretation which is proposed. People may abundantly use the facts in the Old Testament to illustrate human nature, as Paul did; but far distant be the day, when the principles of Origen and of Cocceius shall again prevail, and when it shall be assumed, that "the Bible means every thing that it can be made to mean."<p>(These are excellent remarks, and the caution which the author gives against extravagant and imaginative systems of interpreting scripture cannot be too often repeated. It is allowed, however, nearly on all hands, that this allegory is brought forward by way of illustration only, and not of argument. This being the case, the question, as to whether the history in Genesis were originally intended represent the matter, to which Paul here applies it, is certainly not of very great importance, notwithstanding the learned labor that has been expended on it, and to such an extent as to justify the critic's remark. "vexavit interprets vehementer vexatus ab iis et ipse." Whatever be the original design of the passage, the apostle has employed it as an illustration of his subject, and was guided by the Spirit of inspiration in so doing. But certainly we should not be very far wrong, if since an apostle has affirmed such spiritual representation, we should suppose it originally intended by the Spirit; nor are we in great danger of making types of every pin and pillar, so long as we strictly confine ourselves to the admission of such only as rest upon apostolic authority. "This transaction," says the eminently judicious Thomas Scott, "was so remarkable, the coincidence so exact, and the illustration so instructive, that we cannot doubt it originally was intended, by the Holy Spirit, as an allegory and type of those things to which the inspired apostle referred it.") <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. So then&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "Wherefore." This is the conclusion inferred from what precedes. In Ga 3:29 and Ga 4:7, it was established that we, New Testament believers, are "heirs." If, then, we are heirs, "we are not children of the bond woman (whose son, according to Scripture, was 'not to be heir,' Ga 4:30), but of the free woman (whose son was, according to Scripture, to be heir). For we are not "cast out" as Ishmael, but accepted as sons and heirs.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The church of the Gentiles was not typified in Hagar, but in Sarah; from whence the scope of the apostle is to conclude, that we are not under the law, obliged to Judaical observances, but are freed from them, and are justified by faith in Christ alone, not by the works of the law. By this conclusion the apostle maketh way for the exhortation in the following chapter, pressing them to stand fast in their liberty. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So then, brethren,.... This is the conclusion of the whole allegory, or the mystical interpretation of Agar and Sarah, and their sons: <p>we are not children of the bondwoman; the figure of the first covenant, which gendered to bondage, and typified the Jews in a state, and under a spirit of bondage to the law; New Testament saints are not under it, are delivered from it, and are dead unto it: <p>but of the free; of Sarah, that was a type of the new and second covenant; and answered to the Gospel church, which is free from the yoke of the law; and whose children believers in Christ are, by whom they are made free from all thraldom and slavery; so the children of the mistress and of the maidservant are opposed to each other by the Jews (k).

But first of all, as a basis for this exhortation, he prefixes to it the proposition—resulting from the previous instruction—which forms the “pith of the allegory” (Holsten), and exactly as such is fitted to be the theoretical principle placed at the head of the practical course of action to be required in the sequel, <a href="/galatians/4-31.htm" title="So then, brothers, we are not children of the female slave, but of the free.">Galatians 4:31</a>.

The preceding allegory has illustrated the essential difference between the heritage of Jews and Christians. Whereas Jews inherit bondage to Law, freedom is the Christian birthright, derived from their heavenly mother. The Apostle now proceeds to enforce the truth that Christ bestowed this freedom upon us, and that it is an essential principle of our call.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/galatians/4-31.htm" title="So then, brothers, we are not children of the female slave, but of the free.">Galatians 4:31</a> to <a href="/galatians/5-12.htm" title="I would they were even cut off which trouble you.">Galatians 5:12</a>. Freedom is our birthright in Christ and an essential condition of our call. Accordingly the Apostle protests against the claim that all Christians should be circumcised, as a departure from the spirit of Christ, a dangerous innovation which the churches will certainly condemn, and a superstition of the flesh on a par with the grossest heathen superstitions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">31</span>. <span class="ital">So then</span>] Better, <span class="bld">wherefore</span>.

The following are the probable translations of these several forms of the text: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Therefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman: stand fast then in [or, 'by,' or, 'to'] the freedom with which Christ set us free; and do not again get held in a yoke of bondage." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman: with freedom did Christ set us free; stand fast, then," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman; in the freedom with which Christ set us free stand fast, then, and," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a hand maid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the free woman by [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'by virtue of'] the freedom [or, 'children of her who is free with that free dora'] with which Christ set us free; stand fast, then, and," etc. It will be seen by the above that there appears a general agreement among recent editors of the Greek text upon three points: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> they all substitute <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> - an alteration which makes no  difference whatever in the sense; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> they expunge the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> they insert <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The forms <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> are identical except in the punctuation. The construction of the dative <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in forms <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is difficult, and has not yet been quite satisfactorily accounted for. We miss the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, to express the idea of <span class="accented">immanence</span> which is evidently intended, and to express which <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is elsewhere found present; as <a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a>. The arrangement given in form <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is, in addition, greatly embarrassed by the "then" standing so far on in the sentence - this particle marking, as it does, an inference from the sentence in the preceding verse. The furthest place in the sentence adduced by Winer ('Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 61) is the fourth word, in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>. The fourth form presents by far the easiest construction. It seems strange, however, if this was the original text, that it came to be changed into shapes so much more difficult to construe. In the second form, the clause, "with freedom did Christ set us free," seems somewhat strangely phrased; but this iteration of the idea of freedom, marking the apostle's anxious insistance upon it, may have led the copyists to suspect an error of transcription, and thus have set them upon the endeavour to improve, as they thought, the text before them. The same anxious insistance upon an idea leads the apostle to a somewhat similar introduction of a clause which is almost a parenthesis, in <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>, "By grace have ye been saved." It will be noticed that the variations in the text above noted make not the smallest difference in the main contents of thought. The same factors of thought are present in all. The further remarks now to be made will assume for their basis the second form of the text. <span class="accented">Wherefore</span>, <span class="accented">brethren</span>, <span class="accented">we are not a handmaid's children</span>, <span class="accented">but</span> children <span class="accented">of the freewoman.</span> This, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;</span> (Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) gathers up the result of the whole foregoing allegorical exposition, not that of its concluding portion only, as a basis for practical remark. "We are not a handmaid's children;" that is, "It is not a slave-girl that is our mother." The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, not because the apostle is thinking, as some imagine, of there being other handmaids besides Mosaism, as, for example, heathen ceremonialism; for the context points to only one slave-girl that can possibly answer to Hagar; but because he wishes by contrast to fasten attention upon the character of her who is our mother. Hence also there is no <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 28. "<span class="accented">But children</span> of the <span class="accented">freewoman</span>," or "of her who is free;" not defining what individual is our mother, but, who our mother is being now assumed as known, marking what her condition is. <span class="accented">With freedom did Christ set us free</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). 'This clause both justifies and explains the word "freewoman." Our mother is a freewoman, because all her children have been emancipated by Christ; and the nature of her freedom is likewise defined by the nature of his work. This sense is more directly asserted in the fourth form of the Greek text - "children of the freewoman by the freedom with which Christ set us free;" but it is in reality contained in the second. Christ's emancipating work was twofold: he at once, by his atonement, effected our deliverance from guilt, and by the manner of his death (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>) disconnected his people from the ceremonial Law. The former aspect of his work is essential to the beneficial effect of the latter. The clear realization of the fact that he has effected our perfect reconciliation with God cuts up from its roots all desire even, that we should ourselves strive, either to make or to keep ourselves acceptable with God by obedience to a Law of positive ordinances; while we also must see that, as connected with a Crucified One, it is impossible that we can be in harmony with the Mosaic ritual. A desire to Judaize cannot eoexist with true faith in our crucified Redeemer. By affirming that Christ hath set us free, the apostle points, not merely to our release from real or fancied obligation to obey the Law of Moses, but also to our "joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have received reconciliation "(<a href="/romans/5-11.htm">Romans 5:11</a>). <span class="accented">Stand fast</span>, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> According to this reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> standing alone receives its colour of reference from the context. So <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>. Here it means the steadfast holding to a whole-hearted assurance that in Christ Jesus our freedom is complete. <span class="accented">And do not again get held in a yoke of bondage.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> used (Herod., 2:121) literally of being caught and held fast by a man-trap; also figuratively of being entangled with perplexities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, Herod., 1:190), with a curse, or with guilt, or with arbitrary dicta of a teacher (see Liddell and Scott). The condition of a slave is described by the word "yoke," <a href="/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "As many as are bond-servants under the yoke." And it was probably with this particular shade of meaning that St. Peter used the term at the conference at Jerusalem respecting the ceremonial Law (<a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>) - "a yoke which neither we nor our fathers had strength enough to bear;" referring to it, we may suppose, as slavery, not merely because obedience to it was difficult, but as being observed from a legalistic anxiety to approve one's self thereby to the Divine acceptance or to escape the Divine displeasure. This view of the passage explains how the apostle  was able to use the word "again" of these Galatian converts. They had been once under the yoke of an "evil conscience;" but Christ had come to them also, who were "afar off" in Gentile guiltiness, preaching peace, as he had come to them that were "nigh" in the Israelite covenant (<a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). But if they could not have "peace" and "access to the Father" save through conformity with Mosaic eeremonialism, then their "freedom" was forfeited; they sank back again into their former state of bondage. But see also the note on ver. 9. This exhortation to "stand fast" presupposes that they had not yet lapsed, but were only in danger of it (comp. the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> of <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
