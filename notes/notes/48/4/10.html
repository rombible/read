but other fasts or festivals which occupied a single day may be included.<p><span class= "bld">Months.</span>—The description mounts in an ascending scale—days, months, seasons, years. The “months,” however, mean really “the first day of the month,” the “new moon.” (See <a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall you have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.">Leviticus 23:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm" title="And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;">Numbers 28:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/81-3.htm" title="Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.">Psalm 81:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Times.</span>—<span class= "ital">Seasons</span>: such as the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.<p><span class= "bld">Years.</span>—Such as the sabbatical year and the year of jubilee. The Apostle is giving a list which is intended to be exhaustive of all Jewish observances, so that it would not necessarily follow that the Galatians had actually kept the year of jubilee, or even that it was kept literally by the Jews at this time.<p>As to the bearing of this passage on the general question of the observance of seasons, it is to be noticed that the reference is here to the adoption by the Galatians of the <span class= "ital">Jewish</span> seasons as a mark of the extent to which they were prepared to take on themselves the burden of the Mosaic law. It does not necessarily follow that the observance of Christian seasons is condemned. At the same time, it is quite clear that St. Paul places all such matters under the head of “elements” or “rudiments.” They belong to the lowest section of Christian practice, and the more advanced a Christian is the less he needs to be bound by them. This, again, is qualified by the consideration that it is dangerous for any one individual to assume his own advanced condition, and to think himself able to dispense with the safeguards which his brother-Christians require. It is safest to follow the general rule of the Church, so long as it is done <span class= "ital">intelligently</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> with a consciousness of the reason and expediency of what is done, and not in a spirit of mere mechanical routine. The comparison between the literal and the spiritual observance of seasons, and the superiority of the latter as the more excellent way, is well brought out by Origen in some comments upon this passage: “If it be objected to us on this subject that we are accustomed to observe certain days—as, for example, the Lord’s Day, the Preparation, the Passover, or Pentecost—I have to answer that, to the perfect Christian—who is ever in his thoughts, words, and deeds serving his natural Lord, God the Word—all his days are the Lord’s, and he is always keeping the Lord’s Day. He, also, who is unceasingly preparing himself for the true life, and abstaining from the pleasures of this life which lead astray so many, such a one is always keeping the Preparation Day. Again, he who considers that ‘Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us,’ and that it is his duty to keep the feast by eating of the flesh of the Word, never ceases to keep the Paschal Feast. And, finally, he who can truly say: ‘We are risen with Christ,’ and ‘He hath exalted us, and made us sit with Him in heavenly places in Christ,’ is always living in the season of Pentecost . . . But the majority of those who are accounted believers are not of this advanced class; but from being either unable or unwilling to keep every day in this manner, they require some sensible memorial to prevent spiritual things from passing away altogether from their minds” (<span class= "ital">Against Celsus,</span> viii. 22, 23).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:8-11 The happy change whereby the Galatians were turned from idols to the living God, and through Christ had received the adoption of sons, was the effect of his free and rich grace; they were laid under the greater obligation to keep to the liberty wherewith he had made them free. All our knowledge of God begins on his part; we know him because we are known of him. Though our religion forbids idolatry, yet many practise spiritual idolatry in their hearts. For what a man loves most, and cares most for, that is his god: some have their riches for their god, some their pleasures, and some their lusts. And many ignorantly worship a god of their own making; a god made all of mercy and no justice. For they persuade themselves that there is mercy for them with God, though they repent not, but go on in their sins. It is possible for those who have made great professions of religion, to be afterwards drawn aside from purity and simplicity. And the more mercy God has shown, in bringing any to know the gospel, and the liberties and privileges of it, the greater their sin and folly in suffering themselves to be deprived of them. Hence all who are members of the outward church should learn to fear and to suspect themselves. We must not be content because we have some good things in ourselves. Paul fears lest his labour is in vain, yet he still labours; and thus to do, whatever follows, is true wisdom and the fear of God. This every man must remember in his place and calling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye observe - The object of this verse is to specify some of the things to which they had become enslaved.<p>Days - The days here referred to are doubtless the days of the Jewish festivals. They had numerous days of such observances, and in addition to those specified in the Old Testament, the Jews had added many others as days commemorative of the destruction and rebuilding of the temple, and of other important events in their history. It is not a fair interpretation of this to suppose that the apostle refers to the Sabbath, properly so called, for this was a part of the Decalogue; and was observed by the Saviour himself, and by the apostles also. It is a fair interpretation to apply it to all those days which are not commanded to be kept holy in the Scriptures; and hence, the passage is as applicable to the observance of saints' days, and days in honor of particular events in sacred history, as to the days observed by the Galatians. There is as real servitude in the observance of the numerous festivals, and fasts in the papal communion and in some Protestant churches, as there was in the observance of the days in the Jewish ecclesiastical calendar, and for anything that I can see, such observances are as inconsistent now with the freedom of the gospel as they were in the time of Paul. We should observe as seasons of holy time what it can be proved God has commanded us, and no more.<p>And months - The festivals of the new moon, kept by the Jews. <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-14</a>. On this festival, in addition to the daily sacrifice, two bullocks, a ram, and seven sheep of a year old were offered in sacrifice. The appearance of the new-moon was announced by the sound of trumpets. See Jahn, Archae. 352.<p>And times - Stated times; festivals returning periodically, as the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. See Jahn, Archae. chap. 3.-346-360.<p>And years - The sabbatical year, or the year of jubilee.

To regard the observance of certain days as in itself meritorious as a work, is alien to the free spirit of Christianity. This is not incompatible with observing the Sabbath or the Christian Lord's day as obligatory, though not as a work (which was the Jewish and Gentile error in the observance of days), but as a holy mean appointed by the Lord for attaining the great end, holiness. The whole life alike belongs to the Lord in the Gospel view, just as the whole world, and not the Jews only, belong to Him. But as in Paradise, so now one portion of time is needed wherein to draw off the soul more entirely from secular business to God (Col 2:16). "Sabbaths, new moons, and set feasts" (1Ch 23:31; 2Ch 31:3), answer to "days, months, times." "Months," however, may refer to the first and seventh months, which were sacred on account of the number of feasts in them.<p>times&#8212;Greek, "seasons," namely, those of the three great feasts, the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.<p>years&#8212;The sabbatical year was about the time of writing this Epistle, A.D. 48 [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If we had any evidence that these Galatians were relapsed to their Gentile superstitions, these terms might be understood of such days, &c. as they kept in honour to their idols. But the apostle, throughout the whole Epistle, not reflecting upon them for any such gross apostacy (as returning to the vanities of the heathen in which they formerly lived); but only for Judaizing, and using the ceremonies of the Jewish law, as necessary to be observed, besides their believing in Christ, for their justification; it is much more probable that he meaneth by <span class="ital">days</span> the Jewish festivals, such as their new moons, &c.; by <span class="ital">months, </span> the first and the seventh month, when they religiously fasted; by <span class="ital">times, </span> their more solemn times, such as were their feasts of first-fruits, tabernacles, &c.; and by <span class="ital">years, </span> their years of jubilee, the seventh and the fiftieth year. His meaning is, that they took themselves to be under a religious obligation to observe these times as still commanded by God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. Lest the apostle should be thought to suggest, without foundation, the inclination of these people to be in bondage to the ceremonies of the law, he gives this as an instance of it; which is to be understood, not of a civil observation of times, divided into days, months, and years, for which the luminaries of the heavens were made, and into summer and winter, seedtime and harvest, which is not only lawful, but absolutely necessary; but of a religious observation of days, &amp;c. not of the lucky and unlucky days, or of any of the festivals of the Gentiles, but of Jewish ones. By "days" are meant their seventh day sabbaths; for since they are distinguished from months and years, they must mean such days as returned weekly; and what else can they be but their weekly sabbaths? These were peculiar to the Israelites, and not binding on others; and being typical of Christ, the true rest of his people, and he being come, are now ceased. By "months" are designed their new moons, or the beginning of their months upon the appearance of a new moon, which were kept by blowing trumpets, offering sacrifices, hearing the word of God, abstaining from work, and holding religious feasts; and were typical of that light, knowledge, and grace, the church receives from Christ, the sun of righteousness; and he, the substance, being come, these shadows disappeared. By "times" are intended the three times in the year, when the Jewish males appeared before the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the three feasts of tabernacles, passover, and pentecost, for the observance of which there was now no reason; not of the feast of tabernacles, since the word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us; nor of the passover, since Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us; nor of pentecost, or the feast of weeks, or of the first fruits of the harvest, since the Spirit of God was poured down in a plenteous manner on that day upon the apostles; and when the firstfruits of a glorious harvest were brought in to the Lord, in the conversion of three thousand souls. And by "years" are to be understood their sabbatical years; every seventh year the land had a rest, and remained untilled; there were no ploughing and sowing, and there was a general release of debtors; and every fiftieth year was a jubilee to the Lord, when liberty to servants, debtors, &amp;c. was proclaimed throughout the land: all which were typical of rest, payment of debts, and spiritual liberty by Christ; and which having their accomplishment in him, were no longer to be observed; wherefore these Galatians are blamed for so doing; and the more, because they were taught to observe them, in order to obtain eternal life and salvation by them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-10.htm" title="You observe days, and months, and times, and years.">Galatians 4:10</a>.

But that the Galatians were at that time in some way actually celebrating a sabbatical year (Wieseler), cannot be certainly inferred from <span class="greekheb">ἐνιαυτ</span>., which has in reality its due warrant as belonging to the consistency and completeness of the theory. On the whole passage, comp. <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>, and Philo, de septenar. p. 286.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From our passage, moreover, we see how far, and within what limits, the Galatians had already been led astray.[190] They had not yet adopted <span class="ital">circumcision</span>, but were only in danger of being brought to it (<a href="/context/galatians/5-2.htm" title="Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing....">Galatians 5:2-3</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-12.htm" title="I would they were even cut off which trouble you.">Galatians 5:12</a>, <a href="/context/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ....">Galatians 6:12-13</a>). Nothing at all is said in the epistle as to any <span class="ital">distinction of meats</span> (comp. Col. <span class="ital">l.c</span>), except so far as it was implied in the observance of days, etc. Usteri (comp. Rückert) is of opinion that Paul did not mention circumcision and the distinction of meats, because he desired to represent the present religious attitude of his readers as analogous to their <span class="ital">heathen</span> condition. But, according to the comprehensive idea of the <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου</span>, even the mention of circumcision and the distinctions of meats would have been in no way inappropriate to the <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ἄνωθεν</span>. Olshausen quite arbitrarily asserts that the usages mentioned stand <span class="ital">by synecdoche for all</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[190] De Wette very arbitrarily considers that the present tense denotes, not the <span class="ital">reality</span> then present, but only the necessary consequence of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιετρ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">δουλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θέλετε</span>, <span class="ital">conceived</span> as being already present.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/galatians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-10.htm" title="You observe days, and months, and times, and years.">Galatians 4:10</a>. The observance of Sabbaths and new moons, of feasts and fasts, of sabbatical and jubilee years, was clearly enjoined by the ceremonial Law; and Paul admitted the obligations of that Law for himself and for all the Circumcision. He continued to frequent the Sabbath-worship of the synagogue, attended the feasts, bound himself under voluntary vows. What he condemns is the adoption of these practices by baptised Gentiles: for this imputed to them an inherent sacredness incompatible with the true freedom of the Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>.

It is compounded of a verb which means to <span class="ital">observe</span> and a preposition which implies that either the purpose or the method of observation is <span class="ital">bad</span>. The <span class="ital">simple</span> verb and corresponding noun are commonly used in N.

These reactionaries were full of festival-observing pedantry - "days," "new moons," "festivals," "holy years," being always on their lips. The meaning of the first three of the nouns is partially suggested by <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>, "Let no man judge you...  in respect of a feast day, or a new moon, or a sabbath day (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" in which passage, we may observe, there is a similar tone of half-mocking mimesis; where the same ideas are apparently presented, but in a reverse order. Comp. also <a href="/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>, Offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles." The "days," then, in the present passage, we may suppose, are the sabbath days, together perhaps with the two fast days every week which the Jewish tradition prescribed (<a href="/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>). The "months" point to the new moons, the observance of which might occasion to these Gentiles considerable scope for discussion in adjusting themselves to the Jewish calendar, different no doubt from the calendar they had been hitherto used to. The "seasons" would be the annual festivals and fasts of the Jews, not only the three prescribed by the Levitical Law, but also certain others added by tradition, as the Feasts of Purim and of Dedication. So far we appear to be on tolerably sure ground. The fourth item, "years," may refer either to the sabbatical year (<a href="/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2-7</a>), which at any rate latterly the Jews had got to pay much attention to (1 Macc. 6:49, 53; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:10, 6; also 14:16, 2; Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 5:4); or possibly the jubilee years, one such fiftieth year, it might be, falling about this time due. Bengel ('Gnomon') supposes that a sabbatical year might be being held A.D. , to which date he assigns this Epistle; while Wieseler ('Chronicles Synops.,' p. 204, etc., referred to by Bishop Lightfoot) offers a similar conjecture for the year A.D.  autumn to A.D.  autumn. Very striking is the impatience which the apostle manifests in overhearing as it were the eager discussions occupying the attention of these foolish Galatian Judaizers. Their interest, he perceived, was absorbed by matters which were properly for them things of no concern at all, but which, with ostentatious zeal as such persons do, they were <span class="accented">making</span> their concern. The cause of their doing so lay, we may believe, in the feeling which was growing up in their minds that such like outward observances would of themselves make their life acceptable to God; this general sentiment habiting itself, in the choice of the particular form of outward ceremonies to be adopted, in the observance of the celebrations given by God to his people for the season of their nonage. The principle itself was no doubt repugnant to the apostle's mind, even apart from the Judaizing form which it was  assuming, and which threatened a defection from Christ. Curious regard to such matters he evidently on its own account regards with scorn and impatience. But therewith also the old venerable religion, localized at Jerusalem as its chief seat, would under the impulse of such sentiments be sure to perilously attract their minds away from the "reformation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>) to which it had now been subjected; and they were in danger of losing, nay, had in great degree at least already lost, the zest which they once had fell in embracing the exceeding great and precious gifts which Christ had brought to them. What was there here but the "evil heart of unbelief" spoken of in <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>, "in departing from the living God," now manifesting himself to his people in his Son? It is this animus characterizing the behaviour of the Galatian Churchmen which marks its essential difference as compared with that observance of "days" and "meats" which in <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. the apostle treats as a matter, relative to which Christians were to live in mutual tolerance. As long as a Christian continued to feel his relation to the Lord Jesus (<a href="/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6-9</a>), it mattered not much if he thought it desirable to observe the Jewish sabbath or to abstain from eating animal food. He might, indeed, make himself thereby chargeable with spiritual unwisdom; the apostle clearly thought he would; but if he still held fast by Christ as the sole and all-sufficing Source to him of righteousness before God and of spiritual life, he was to be received and welcomed as a brother, without being vexed by interference with these foolish tenets of his. It became different when his care for such really indifferent externals took his heart away from a satisfied adherence to the Lord; then his ceremonialism or asceticism became rank and even fatal heresy. And this was what the apostle was fearing on behalf of his once so greatly cherished disciples in Galatia. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye observe (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>See on <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm">Mark 3:2</a>, and see on <a href="//biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12</a>, and comp.
