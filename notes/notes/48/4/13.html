In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always.

T. 499], <span class="ital">on account of</span> weakness of the flesh:[193] so that it is clear, that on Paul’s first journey through Galatia (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a>) he was compelled by reason of bodily weakness to make a stay there, which properly did not form a part of his plan; and that during this sojourn, forced on him by necessity, he preached the gospel to the Galatians. <span class="ital">How</span> he suffered, and <span class="ital">from what cause</span>, whether from natural sickness (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>),[194] or from ill-treatment which he had previously endured on account of the gospel (comp. <a href="/galatians/6-17.htm" title="From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.">Galatians 6:17</a>), we do not know. The mention of an <span class="ital">involuntary</span> or rather <span class="ital">quite unpremeditated</span> working among the Galatians is not <span class="ital">opposed</span> to the apostle’s aim (as Rückert objects), but <span class="ital">favourable</span> to it; because the love which received him so heartily and joyfully must have been all the greater, the less it depended on the duty of befitting gratitude for a benefit <span class="ital">previously</span> destined for the recipients, and for exertions made expressly on their account. Many others have understood <span class="greekheb">διά</span> as denoting the apostle’s <span class="ital">condition:</span> “<span class="ital">amidst bodily weakness</span>,” which is then referred by some, and indeed most expositors, following Chrysostom and Luther, to <span class="ital">persecutions and sufferings</span>, by others to his <span class="ital">insignificant appearance</span> (Calvin), by others to <span class="ital">sickness</span> (Rückert, Matthies, Olshausen, Ewald; comp. also in Jerome), and by others even to <span class="ital">embarrassment</span> and <span class="ital">perplexity</span> on account of the strange circumstances (Baumgarten-Crusius). But in this case <span class="greekheb">διά</span> must have been used with the <span class="ital">genitive</span> (see Matthiae, p. 1353; Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom</span>. I. p. 138); for expressions such as <span class="greekheb">διὰ δῶμα</span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΝΎΚΤΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΣΤΌΜΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙʼ ΑἸΘΈΡΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, in which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΆ</span></span></span> denotes <span class="ital">stretching through</span>, are <span class="ital">merely poetical</span> (see Schaefer, <span class="ital">ad Mosch</span>. 4. 91; Bernhardy, p. 236 f.; Kühner, II. p. 282).

Hence we must reject also the explanation of Grotius: “per varios casus, per mille pericula rerum perrexi, ut vos instituerem.” Others still have gone so far as to refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙʼ ἈΣΘ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τῆς ΣΑΡΚΌς</span></span></span> to weakness of the <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, to which Paul <span class="ital">accommodated himself</span>. So Jerome, Estius, Hug, and Rettig <span class="ital">l.c</span>. p. 108 ff.: “<span class="ital">I have preached to you on account of the weakness of your flesh</span>,” which is supposed to mean: “I have in my preaching had respect to the infirmity of your flesh.” Utterly mistaken: because Paul must necessarily have added a modal definition to <span class="greekheb">εὐηγγ</span>. (even if it had only been an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὝΤΩς</span></span></span>), or must have written <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤʼ ἈΣΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙʼ ἈΣΘ</span></span></span>.; moreover, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῇ ΣΑΡΚΊ ΜΟΥ</span></span></span> in <a href="/galatians/4-14.htm" title="And my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.">Galatians 4:14</a> shows that Paul meant the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΣΘΈΝΕΙΑ Τῆς ΣΑΡΚΌς</span></span></span> to apply <span class="ital">to himself</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ πρότερον</span>] may mean either: <span class="ital">earlier</span>, at an earlier time, so that it would be said from the standpoint of the present (Thuc. i. 12.

It is interpreted in the former sense by Usteri and Fritzsche, and in the latter by Koppe, Winer, Rückert, Matthies, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Wieseler, Hilgenfeld, Ewald, Hofmann, and others.[195] The latter is the correct view, so that <span class="greekheb">τὸ πρότερον</span> presupposes a <span class="ital">second</span> sojourn of the apostle among the Galatians. For if he had preached among them only once, <span class="greekheb">τὸ πρότερον</span> would have been quite an idle, superfluous addition. But Paul adds it just in order to denote quite distinctly his <span class="ital">first</span> visit, during which he founded the churches (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a>): at his <span class="ital">second</span> visit (<a href="/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>), the happy experiences which he had enjoyed <span class="greekheb">τὸ πρότερον</span> were not repeated in such full measure; the churches were already tainted by Judaism. Comp. Introd. § 2, 3. Fritzsche, indeed, maintains that <a href="/context/galatians/4-18.htm" title="But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you....">Galatians 4:18-19</a> imply that Paul before the composition of the epistle had only <span class="ital">once</span> visited the Galatians; but see on <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[193] Bengel also translates correctly: “<span class="ital">propter infirmitatem</span>,” but erroneously explains that the weakness was not indeed “<span class="ital">causa praedicationis ipsius</span>,” but “<span class="ital">adjumentum</span>, cur P. <span class="ital">efficacius</span> praedicaret, cum Galatae facilius rejicere posse viderentur.” Similarly, but still more incorrectly, Schott, who detects an “<span class="ital">acumen singulare</span>” in Paul’s saying: “<span class="ital">per ipsam aegritudinem carnis</span> doctrinam divinam vobis tradidi;” for the fact that Paul, although sick, had preached very zealously, had been of great influence in making his preaching more successful. In this interpretation everything is mistaken: for <span class="greekheb">διά</span> must have been used with the <span class="ital">genitive;</span> the “<span class="ital">ipsam</span>” and the thought of <span class="ital">successful</span> preaching are quite gratuitously imported; and the whole of the alleged “<span class="ital">acumen</span>” would be completely out of place <span class="ital">here</span>, where Paul wishes to remind his readers of their <span class="ital">love</span> then shown to him, and <span class="ital">not</span> of the efficacy of his preaching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[194] In respect to 2 Cor. <span class="ital">l.c</span>., Holsten, in Hilgenfeld’s <span class="ital">Zeitschrift</span>, 1861, p. 250 f., conceives it to refer to epileptical disturbances of the circulatory and nervous system, such as occur among <span class="ital">visionaries</span>.

This can only mean <span class="ital">owing to infirmity of the flesh, i.e.</span>, to illness. <span class="greekheb">διά</span> with accusative has the same causal force in the N.T. as in Attic Greek. A phrase like <span class="greekheb">διά νύκτα</span>, <span class="ital">by night</span>, is found in Homer, but <span class="greekheb">διά</span> subsequently lost its temporal force, and only regained it in the Latinised Greek of later centuries from confusion with the Latin <span class="ital">per.</span> The position of <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀσθένειαν</span> before the verb lays stress upon the fact that the ministry was due to illness alone, and not to spontaneous resolve.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It appears from this and the following verses that the illness occurred under the eyes of the Galatians, who watched its progress, were familiar with its repulsive symptoms, and displayed tender sympathy with the sufferer. They were aware also of the alteration it had made in his plans. The inference from these facts is clear, that he did not intend at the time of his arrival in Galatia to preach there at all, but was prostrated immediately after by sudden illness, and so forced to relinquish his previous project and abandon for the present any further journey. The only conceivable way, in short, in which an attack of illness in Galatia can have occasioned his preaching there was by involuntary detention. Here, accordingly, the motive for mentioning it is to show how little claim he had on the gratitude of the Galatians at that time, and how little he had deserved the tender sympathy which they exhibited. The historical connection of this illness with the ministry of Paul and Barnabas is investigated in the Introduction (pp. 135–7).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been suggested that this attack was perhaps identical with the <span class="greekheb">σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί</span> mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>, and this may be true, but the real nature of the <span class="greekheb">σκόλοψ</span> is unknown. Some features of this attack on the contrary may be inferred from the description given of its effects: it incapacitated the patient for travel, produced disfigurement and offensive symptoms, but allowed free intercourse with those around him. His success in winning the hearts of those who visited him in his sick chamber suggests a chronic ailment prolonged for a considerable time, as does also the complete change in his plans. The only definite hint given of a specific malady is the language of <a href="/galatians/4-15.htm" title="Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.">Galatians 4:15</a> : from which I gather that the eyesight was imperilled by a virulent attack of ophthalmia. That disease was notoriously prevalent in the lowlands of Pamphylia through which he had been travelling, and if so contracted, would produce the symptoms described. The pathetic appeal to Galatian sympathy on the score of imperfect sight in <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a> confirms this view. If his sight had been impaired by an illness to which they had themselves ministered with tender solicitude, they would be quick to feel for his privation.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ πρότερον</span>. Lightfoot contends with justice that this phrase cannot on account of the prefixed article refer to an indefinite period in time past. The author clearly had in his mind two distinct periods, an earlier and a later, during the earlier of which he states that his preaching had been occasioned by illness. Lightfoot suggests that he referred perhaps to the two visits which he had paid to the Galatian Churches: and the suggestion is reasonable if his theory be accepted of sites in Northern Galatia, for no details are known of either visit. But it is quite incompatible with the history of his ministry in Southern Galatia recorded in Acts 13, 14. That lasted over two winters at the very least, comprised two visits at considerable intervals to each of the Churches, and displayed throughout as resolute an initiative, as determined energy, as vigorous activity, as can be found in the whole course of his apostolic career. That ministry gave certainly no sign of illness, but the contrary. We have seen, however, that it was preceded by a prolonged illness, during which he was probably confined to his sick chamber and could only minister to those who visited him there. His first ministry in Galatia passed in short through two distinct stages, first the private ministrations of a sick man, and then a public career of unexampled vigour and success. The last verse placed the readers on the division line between the two, for it reminded them of the memorable petition addressed to him and Barnabas at the close of his first public address in the synagogue of the Pisidian Antioch. It is, therefore, of the preceding period that he writes here, “You know that it was owing to illness that I had preached to you <span class="ital">up to that time</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὸ πρότερον</span>)”. It is needless to dwell on the complete harmony of this interpretation with the context.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">through infirmity of the flesh</span>] Rather, as R.V. ‘because of an infirmity of the flesh’, owing to bodily sickness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What was this infirmity? Most commentators identify it with the ‘thorn in the flesh’, <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>. Bp Lightfoot (p. 169 foll.) enumerates in chronological order the different conjectures which have been put forward in early and more modern times. They are (1) some bodily ailment, (2) persecution, (3) fleshly desires, (4) spiritual trials, such as temptations to despair, blasphemous suggestions of the Devil. The most recent expositors recur to the earliest view of this infirmity—that it was some bodily ailment. Bp Lightfoot conjectures that it was ‘of the nature of epilepsy’. Between this suggestion and that of some defect of eye-sight, perhaps acute ophthalmia, it is not easy to choose. The passages adduced in support of this latter conjecture are not conclusive in its favour, though their cumulative evidence is strong. They are discussed in an interesting note by Bp. Lightfoot, p. 174, note 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">at the first</span>] Probably, ‘on the former occasion’, i.e. on the earlier of my two visits, mentioned <a href="/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a>.

We may fairly infer from the Apostle’s language that on the former occasion he had not intended to preach the Gospel in Galatia, but that sickness of some kind (probably <span class="ital">acute</span> disorder) detained him there, and that notwithstanding weakness and pain—distress to himself, and disadvantage to the reception of his message—he proclaimed the Gospel of his Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/galatians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δἰ ἀσθενείαν</span>) <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span>, <span class="ital">on account of, by reason of infirmity</span>.

The phrase as so used is equivalent to "We [or, 'you'] do not need to be told," etc.; and with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> is simply a formula introducing such a reminiscence, this conjunction having in such cases head versative force, but being simply the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of transition (meta-batic); equivalent to "now" or "and," or not needing to be represented at all in translation; so that the Authorized Version is perfectly justified in omitting it in the present instance. The phrase may be taken as meaning "And you will well remember." If the apostle had intended to introduce a statement strongly adversative to the last preceding sentence, he would probably have written <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (ch. 2:7) or some such phrase. <span class="cmt_word">How through infirmity of the</span>  <span class="cmt_word">flesh I</span> <span class="cmt_word">preached the gospel unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="accented">that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you.</span> "An infirmity of the flesh;" that is, a bodily illness.

It also denotes a nervous disablement, as <a href="/luke/13-11.htm">Luke 13:11, 12</a>; <a href="/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is the common word for "being sick," as <a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href="/luke/7-10.htm">Luke 7:10</a>; <a href="/john/11-3.htm">John 11:3</a>, etc. It is possible that the apostle meant to say that the Galatians might not unnaturally have thought themselves treated slightingly in that his remaining among them so long was owing to illness and not to his own choice; but that yet, for all that, they had shown themselves most eager in welcoming their involuntary visitor. The words, however, do not require to be thus construed, and in all probability intend no more than to bring back to their remembrance the disorder under which he was then suffering. The illness would seem to have been of a nature to make his personal appearance in some way unsightly, and even repulsive; for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, spat out, of the next verse suggests even the latter idea. Evidently this disorder, as also the one noted in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, did not disqualify him for ministerial work altogether. He adverts to the circumstance, as making it yet more remarkable and more grateful to his feelings, that, notwithstanding the disagreeable aspect which in some way his disorder presented to those about him, they had cherished his presence among them with so much kindness as they did and also with such reverential respect. How it was that his illness brought about this protracted stay, whether it was that he fell ill while journeying through the country so as to be unable to pursue his way to his ulterior destination, or whether the remarkable healthiness of the climate either first attracted him thither or detained him there for convalescence (see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Galatians,' p. 10, note 2, for the character of the climate at Angora, the ancient Ancyra), it is impossible for us to determine. It is noticeable that St. Chrysostom's comments on the passage appear to show that he considered the apostle to be simply stating the circumstances <span class="accented">under which</span> and not those <span class="accented">in consequence of which</span> he preached the gospel to them; and so also OEcumenius and Theophylact paraphrase <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, suggesting the conjecture that they and St. Chrysostom understood the words as equivalent to "during a period of infirmity of the flesh." But this gives to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with an accusative a sense which, to say the least, is not a common one. Is this illness of body to be connected with the affliction, most probably a bodily affliction, mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, "the stake in the flesh"? This latter affliction has been discussed very fully by Dean Stanley and Meyer on the Corinthians, by Bishop Lightfoot in his commentary on the Galatians, and by Dr. Farrar in his ' Life of St. Paul.' It appears to have first befallen the apostle after the "revelations" accorded to him fourteen years before he wrote his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, which he is supposed to have done in the autumn of A.D. . This would bring us back to about A.D. . The apostle's first visit to Galatia, according to Bishop Lightfoot, p. 22, took place about A.D. . When we consider that no doubt many of those wearing labours and hardships, interspersed with frequent suffering of gross personal outrage, recounted in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>, had been undergone in the eight first of those fourteen years (the stoning at Lystra certainly had), it must seem very precarious to conjecture that the malady here referred to was a recurrence of just that particular disorder experienced eight years before. How many other ailments might not the apostle have been subject to, amid the cruel allotment of suffering and hardship which prevailingly marked his course! It is quite as probable, to say the least, that he may then have been suffering in health or in limb from some assault of personal violence recently undergone. St. Luke gives no particulars whatever of this portion of St. Paul's journey, which is only just mentioned in <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. The apostle visited Corinth for the first time not many months after this first sojourn in Galatia; and it is interesting to observe that he speaks of his having then ministered to them in "feebleness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>), in a manner strongly suggestive of bodily weakness. <span class="cmt_word">At the first</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">the first time</span> - an expression plainly implying that there had been a subsequent sojourn. Respecting this latter visit, all we know is what we have so cursorily stated in <a href="/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>; unless, perchance, we may be able to draw some inferences relating to it from what we read in this Epistle itself. Chronologers are pretty well agreed in placing the commencement of this third apostolical journey about three years after the commencement of the second. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye know (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;)<p>The A.V. omits &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; which is wanting in some Mss. &#x394;&#x3b5;&#768; not oppositional as commonly explained: "Ye did not injure me, but on the contrary ye know, etc."; but introducing an explanation of ye did not injure me by reference to the fact that they might easily have been moved to do him wrong by the unfavorable circumstances under which he first preached the gospel to them (through infirmity of the flesh).
