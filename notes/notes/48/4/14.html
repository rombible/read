St. Paul seems to have suffered from grievous bodily infirmity, which he elsewhere (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>) describes as a “thorn (or rather, <span class= "ital">stake</span>) in the flesh.” The effects of this were seen in his personal appearance, which his enemies described as “mean” (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2Corinthians 10:10</a>); and he himself felt it as a corrective against any tendency to spiritual pride (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>). An attack of this malady came upon him during his visit to Galatia, and it was with health shattered by this that he first preached the gospel to the Galatians. Still, to their credit, they took no notice of it, and gave him the warmest possible reception. As to the nature of the malady referred to, see Notes on 2 Corinthians 12.<p><span class= "bld">Despised not, nor rejected.</span>—The second of these two words is stronger than would appear from the English version. It is used of the expression of physical disgust: <span class= "ital">ye despised not, nor loathed.</span> The Apostle says that the Galatians did not despise “their temptation,” meaning “the thing (malady) which they were tempted to despise.”<p><span class= "bld">Even as Christ Jesus.</span>—You showed to the ambassador of Christ as much enthusiasm, as deep and ardent an affection, as you could have shown to Christ Himself.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respecting the law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And my temptation - "My trial," the thing which was to me a trial and calamity. The meaning is, that he was afflicted with various calamities and infirmities, but that this did not hinder their receiving him as an angel from heaven. There is, however, a considerable variety in the mss. on this verse. Many mss., instead of "my temptation," read "your temptation;" and Mill maintains that this is the true reading. Griesbach hesitates between the two. But it is not very important to determine which is the true reading. If it should be "your," then it means that they were tempted by his infirmities to reject him; and so it amounts to about the same thing. The general sense is, that he had some bodily infirmity, perhaps some periodically returning disease, that was a great trial to him, which they bore with, with great patience and affection. What that was, he has not informed us, and conjecture is vain.<p>But received me as an angel of God - With the utmost respect, as if I had been an angel sent from God.<p>Even as Christ Jesus - As you would have done the Redeemer himself. Learn hence:<p>(1) That the Lord Jesus is superior to an angel of God.<p>(2) that the highest proof of attachment to a minister, is to receive him as the Saviour would be received.<p>(3) it showed their attachment to the Lord Jesus, that they received his apostle as they would have received the Saviour himself; compare <a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. my temptation&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "your temptation." My infirmity, which was, or might have been, a "temptation," or trial, to you, ye despised not, that is, ye were not tempted by it to despise me and my message. Perhaps, however, it is better to punctuate and explain as Lachmann, connecting it with Ga 4:13, "And (ye know) your temptation (that is, the temptation to which ye were exposed through the infirmity) which was in my flesh. Ye despised not (through natural pride), nor rejected (through spiritual pride), but received me," &c. "Temptation does not mean here, as we now use the word, tendency to an evil habit, but BODILY TRIAL."<p>as an angel of God&#8212;as a heaven-inspired and sent messenger from God: angel means "messenger" (Mal 2:7). Compare the phrase, 2Sa 19:27, a Hebrew and Oriental one for a person to be received with the highest respect (Zec 12:8). An angel is free from the flesh, infirmity, and temptation.<p>as Christ&#8212;being Christ's representative (Mt 10:40).

This he tells them, partly, to let them know, that what he had spoken was not out of any ill will or prejudice to them; partly, to retain their good will, that they might not show themselves uncertain and inconstant in their judgments and affections; and partly, (as the following verse testifieth), to show the levity of some of them, who had too much forgotten their first judgment of him, and value for him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And my temptation which was in my flesh,.... The same with the infirmity of his flesh, and which was a trial of his faith and patience, and every other grace, as the afflictions of the saints be. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin version read, "your temptation in my flesh"; that which was a trial of them, whether they would receive him or not. This <p>ye despised not; nor the apostle on the account of it, nor his ministry; they thought never the worse of him, nor of the Gospel he preached, because of this: <p>nor rejected; him, nor the counsel of God declared by him, <p>but received me; as they did, into their cities and places of worship, into their houses, and into their hearts and affections: and that <p>as an angel of God; with all that reverence and respect, that high esteem, veneration, and affection, as if one of the celestial inhabitants had been sent down from heaven to bring them the good tidings of the Gospel: or "as a messenger of God", as the phrase may be rendered: as one that had his mission and commission from God, which was not at all disputed by them: but they looked upon him under that character, and regarded him as such, <p>even as Christ Jesus; as his ambassador, as representing him, as being in his stead; yea, if he had been personally present as man among them, they could not have shown greater respect to him as such, than they did to the apostle; for as for any religious worship and adoration, that they did not offer to him; and had they, he would have addressed them in like manner he did the inhabitants of Lystra, <a href="/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a>. Now since they showed him so much respect, notwithstanding all his infirmities, temptations, and afflictions, when he first preached the Gospel; what should hinder that they should not pay the same regard to him now, by abiding in his doctrine and following his example, since he was the same man in his principles and practices now as then? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And my <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> Christ Jesus.</span><p>(n) Those daily troubles with which the Lord tried me among you.<p>(o) For the sake of my ministry.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-14.htm" title="And my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.">Galatians 4:14</a>.

The sense is: <span class="ital">that ye were put to the proof as respected my bodily weakness</span> (namely, as to your receiving and accepting my announcements, demands, etc., notwithstanding this my suffering and impotent appearance; see the antithesis, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὡς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.); <span class="ital">this proof ye have not rejected with disdain and aversion, but on the contrary have submitted yourselves to it so excellently, that ye received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus</span>.

Hence <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ σαρκί</span> did not require the connecting article, as it is in reality blended with <span class="greekheb">τὸν πειρασμὸν ὑμῶν</span> so as to form one idea. See on <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>. And the <span class="ital">definition of the sense</span> of <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ σαρκι μου</span> is derived from <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀσθένειαν τῆς σαρκός</span> in <a href="/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13</a>.

But how aptly does the <span class="ital">negative</span> assertion, that the Galatians, when they were put to the trial by the apostle’s sickness, did not despise and reject this trial, correspond with the positive idea, that, on the contrary, they have received him as an angel of God! And how suitable are the two ideas together to the previous <span class="greekheb">οὐδέν με ἠδικήσατε</span>! 2. <span class="ital">Sententiam verbis parum aptis conceptam esse; expectaras</span> <span class="greekheb">καλῶς ὑπεμείνατε</span>.

So forcible an expression of the negative serves to give the greater prominence to the positive counterpart which follows. In the other Greek writers, besides the simple <span class="greekheb">πτύειν</span> (Soph. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. 649. 1217), there occur only <span class="greekheb">καταπτύειν τινός</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποπτύειν τινά</span> (4Ma 3:18; Eur. <span class="ital">Troad</span>. 668, <span class="ital">Hec</span>. 1265; Hes. <span class="greekheb">ἔργ</span>. 724), and <span class="greekheb">διαπτύειν τινά</span> (in Philo also <span class="greekheb">παραπτύειν</span>) in this <span class="ital">metaphorical</span> sense (see Kypke, II. p. 280; Ruhnk. <span class="ital">Ep. crit</span>. p. 149; Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn</span>. p. 17); but <span class="greekheb">ἐκπτύειν</span> is always used in the <span class="ital">proper</span> sense (Hom. <span class="ital">Od</span>. v. 322; Aristoph. <span class="ital">Vesp</span>. 792; Anthol. Theodorid. 2; Apoll. Rhod. 478), as also <span class="greekheb">ἐμπτύειν τινί</span> (Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn</span>. p. 17). Even in the passage quoted by Kypke, Plut. <span class="ital">de fort. vel virt. Alex</span>. I. p. 328, it is used in the <span class="ital">proper</span> sense, because <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ χαλινόν</span> stands beside it. We are bound to acknowledge this deviation from the Greek usage, and it must be considered as caused by <span class="greekheb">ἐξουθ</span>., as in fact Paul is fond of repeating, not without emphasis, compounds presenting the same preposition (<a href="/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-13.htm" title="And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.">Galatians 2:13</a>; <a href="/romans/2-18.htm" title="And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;">Romans 2:18</a>; <a href="/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then?

Like his Divine Master, he had no natural ‘form nor comeliness’ (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>), and when to this natural disqualification bodily disorder was added, they might well have asked if such a teacher had any claim on their acceptance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye despised not nor rejected</span>] Very strong expressions, implying that there was something repulsive in the character of the disease.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">rejected</span>] Nearly = ‘loathed’.

"My trial "would add to the sentence a tinge of pathetic self-commiseration.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament found only in St. Luke and St. Paul, means always, not merely "to despise," but to <span class="accented">express</span> contempt for a thing, "to scout" (comp. <a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9</a>; <a href="/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a>; <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3, 10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-28.htm">1 Corinthians 1:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a>).

Thus the meaning would be: "You were tempted to treat my preaching contemptuously because of my bodily infirmity; but you did not despise nor reject that which was a temptation to you." This is extremely far fetched, awkward, and quite without parallel in Paul's writings or elsewhere. It does not suit the following but received me, etc. It lays the stress on the Galatians' resistance of a temptation to despise Paul; whereas the idea of a temptation is incidental. On this construction we should rather expect Paul to say: "Ye did despise and repudiate this temptation." Better, make your temptation, etc., dependent on ye know (<a href="/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13</a>); place a colon after flesh, and make both verbs govern me in the following clause. Rend. "Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you the first time, and (ye know) your temptation which was in my flesh: ye did not despise nor reject me, but received me."
