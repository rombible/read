Comp. the Old Testament phrase, “to keep as the apple of an eye” (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm" title="He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm" title="Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings,">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-2.htm" title="Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of your eye.">Proverbs 7:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/galatians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/galatians/4-15.htm" title="Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me....">Galatians 4:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Where is then the blessedness ye spake of </span>— On which ye so congratulated one another?

In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Where is then the blessedness - Margin, "What was" - in accordance with the Greek. The words "ye spake of" are not in the Greek, and should have been printed in italics. But they obscure the sense at any rate. This is not to be regarded as a question, asking what had become of the blessedness, implying that it had departed; but it is rather to be regarded as an exclamation, referring to the happiness of that moment, and their affection and joy when they thus received him. "What blessedness you had then! How happy was that moment! What tenderness of affection! What overflowing joy!" It was a time full of joy, and love, and affectionate confidence. So Tyndale well renders it, "How happy were ye then!" In this interpretation, Doddridge, Rosenmuller, Bloomfield, Koppe, Chandler, and others concur. Locke renders it, "What benedictions did you then pour out on me!"<p>For I bear you record - Itestify.<p>Ye would have plucked out your own eyes ... - No higher proof of attachment could have been given. They loved him so much, that they would have given to him anything, however dear; they would have done anything to contribute to his welfare. How changed, now that they had abandoned his doctrines, and yielded themselves to the guidance of those who taught a wholly different doctrine! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Where, &c.&#8212;Of what value was your congratulation (so the Greek for "blessedness" expresses) of yourselves, on account of your having among you me, the messenger of the Gospel, considering how entirely you have veered about since? Once you counted yourselves blessed in being favored with my ministry.<p>ye would have plucked out your own eyes&#8212;one of the dearest members of the body&#8212;so highly did you value me: a proverbial phrase for the greatest self-sacrifice (Mt 5:29). Conybeare and Howson think that this particular form of proverb was used with reference to a weakness in Paul's eyes, connected with a nervous frame, perhaps affected by the brightness of the vision described, Ac 22:11; 2Co 12:1-7. "You would have torn out your own eyes to supply the lack of mine." The divine power of Paul's words and works, contrasting with the feebleness of his person (2Co 10:10), powerfully at first impressed the Galatians, who had all the impulsiveness of the Celtic race from which they sprang. Subsequently they soon changed with the fickleness which is equally characteristic of Celts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some understand the <span class="ital">blessedness</span> here spoken of in a passive sense; you were then a blessed and happy people, receiving the doctrine of the gospel in the truth and purity of it; what is now become of that blessedness? But both the preceding and the following words seem to rule the sense otherwise, viz. Where is that blessedness which you predicted of me? You called me then blessed, and showed me such a dear affection that you would, if it would have done me good, have parted with what was dearest to you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Where is then the blessedness you spake of?.... Or, as some copies read, "what was then your blessedness?" what, and how great was it? meaning, when the Gospel was first preached to them by him; when Christ was revealed to them as God's salvation; when the doctrines of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, and full pardon by his atonement and satisfaction by his sacrifice, were published among them; when the love of God was shed abroad in their hearts, and the Spirit of Christ was sent thither, crying "Abba", Father: but, alas! where was this blessedness now, since they were turning to the weak and beggarly elements of the ceremonial law, and were inclined to observe its ordinances, and bring themselves hereby into a state of bondage? They were happy persons while under the ministry of the apostle; as a Gospel ministry is a great happiness to any that enjoy it; for this is the way to find eternal life, to have spiritual peace and pleasure, joy and comfort, light and liberty, whereas a contrary doctrine leads to all the reverse. The apostle hereby puts them in mind how they were looked upon as happy persons by himself at that time, whom they received with so much respect and reverence, and his ministry with so much readiness and cheerfulness, and to so much profit and advantage; and also by other churches who were sensible of the high favour they enjoyed, by having so great a preacher of the Gospel among them; and even at that time they thought themselves the happiest persons in the world, and that they could not have been more so, unless they had had Christ himself in person among them; so beautiful were the feet of this bringer of glad tidings to them: <p>for I bear you record, that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me; so fully persuaded was the apostle of their strong and sincere affection for him at that time, that he was ready to attest the truth of this in any form to any persons; that were it a possible thing for them, and could it have been of any advantage to him, they would even have plucked out their eyes, than which nothing is dearer, or more useful to a man, and have parted with them to him, and for his sake; and doubtless persons so affected would cheerfully have laid down their lives for him; but things had taken another turn since. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{p}</span> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if <i>it had been</i> possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</span><p>(p) What a talk was there abroad in the world among men, how happy you were when you received the gospel?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-15.htm" title="Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.">Galatians 4:15</a>. <span class="ital">Of what nature, then, was your self-congratulation?</span> A sorrowful question! for the earnestness with which the Galatians had then congratulated themselves on the apostle’s account, contrasting so sadly with their present circumstances, compelled him to infer that that congratulation was nothing but an effervescent, fleeting, and fickle excitement. Hence the reading <span class="greekheb">ποῦ οὖν</span> (see the critical notes) is a gloss in substance correct; comp. <a href="/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.">Romans 3:27</a>. Others explain it: <span class="ital">On what was</span> your self-congratulation <span class="ital">grounded?

So Bengel, Koppe, Winer, Matthias, and Schott.[196] In this case <span class="ital">qualis</span> would have to be taken in the peculiar sense: <span class="ital">how caused</span>, which, however, would require to be distinctly suggested by the context. Others still, as Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Piscator, Calovius, Wolf, and including Baumgarten-Crusius, Hilgenfeld, Reiche, Wieseler, interpret: “<span class="ital">How great</span> (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>) therefore was your congratulation! how very happy you pronounced yourselves!” But then the <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span> in <a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a> would be deprived of its logical reference, which, according to our interpretation, is contained in <span class="greekheb">τίς οὖν ὁ μακαρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. And the words would, in fact, contain merely a superfluous and feeble exclamation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">μακαρισμός</span> (comp. <a href="/romans/4-6.htm" title="Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,">Romans 4:6</a>; <a href="/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9</a>), with which <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> stands as the genitive of the <span class="ital">subject</span> (comp. Plat. <span class="ital">Rep</span>. p. 590 D), and not as the genitive of the <span class="ital">object</span> (Matthias),—for the object is obvious of itself,—refers to the circumstance that they had congratulated <span class="ital">themselves</span>, not that they had been congratulated by <span class="ital">Paul and others</span> (Jerome, Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius), or even that <span class="ital">they</span> (the Galatians) had congratulated <span class="ital">the apostle</span> (Estius, Locke, Michaelis). See the sequel. The word, synonymous with <span class="greekheb">εὐδαιμονισμός</span>, is never equivalent to <span class="greekheb">μακαριότης</span> (Erasmus, Luther, Piscator, Homberg, Calovius, comp.

Such proverbial modes of expression, based upon the high value and indispensableness of the eyes (<a href="/proverbs/7-2.htm" title="Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of your eye.">Proverbs 7:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm" title="Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings,">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; After the glory has he sent me to the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.">Zechariah 2:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-9.htm" title="And if your eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.">Matthew 18:9</a>; and comp. Vulpius and Doering, <span class="ital">ad Catull</span>. i. 3. 5), are current in all languages. Nevertheless, Lomler (in the <span class="ital">Annal. d. gesammt. theol. Lit</span>. 1831, p. 276), Rückert, and Schott have explained the passage quite <span class="ital">literally</span>: that Paul had some <span class="ital">malady of the eyes</span>, and here states that, if it had been possible, the Galatians would have given him their own sound eyes. But considering the currency of the proverbial sense, how arbitrarily is this view hazarded, seeing that nowhere else do we find a trace of any <span class="ital">malady</span> of the eyes in the apostle![197] Rückert and Schott, indeed, found specially on <span class="greekheb">εἰ δυνατόν</span>, and maintain that, to express the meaning of the ordinary view, Paul must have written: “if it had been <span class="ital">necessary</span>.” But <span class="ital">in any case</span> the idea was a <span class="ital">purely imaginary</span> one, and as a matter of fact <span class="ital">practically impossible</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀδύνατον</span>); if Paul, therefore, had said: “if it had been <span class="ital">necessary</span>,” he would at any rate have expressed himself <span class="ital">unsuitably</span>. Besides, <span class="greekheb">εἰ δυνατόν</span> expresses the self-sacrificing love <span class="ital">in a yet far stronger</span> degree. And, if Paul had not spoken <span class="ital">proverbially</span>, the whole assurance would have been so <span class="ital">hyperbolical</span>, that he certainly could not have stood sponsor for it with the earnest <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρῶ ὑμῖν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐξορύξ</span>.] the standing word for the extirpation of the eyes. See <a href="/judges/16-21.htm" title="But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.">Jdg 16:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-2.htm" title="And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach on all Israel.">1 Samuel 11:2</a>; Herod. viii. 116; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. vi. 5. 1; Wetstein, <span class="ital">in loc</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐδώκατέ μοι</span>] namely, <span class="ital">as property</span>, as a love-pledge of the most joyful self-sacrificing devotedness, not <span class="ital">for use</span> (Hofmann, following older expositors),—a view which, if we do not explain it of a disease of the eyes in the apostle’s case, leads to a monstrous idea. <span class="ital">Without</span> <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span> (see the critical notes) the matter is expressed as more indubitable, the condition contained in the protasis being rhetorically disregarded. See Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Soph. El</span>. 902; <span class="ital">de part</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, p. 70 ff.; Bremi, <span class="ital">ad Lys. Exc</span>.

I. p. 125) well remarks, “Sed cavendum, ne in discrimine utriusque generis, quod pertenue est, constituendo argutemur.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[196] Schott, in opposition to the context, and all the more strangely seeing that he does not even read <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>, but merely supplies it, lays stress upon this <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>: “<span class="ital">illo tempore, nunc non item;</span>” comp. Oecumenius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[197] Lomler and Schott trace back the alleged disease of the eyes to the blindness at Damascus, and identify it with the <span class="greekheb">σκόλοψ</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>). The latter idea is just as mistaken as the former. For the <span class="greekheb">σκόλοψ</span> was, in the apostle’s view, an operation of <span class="ital">Satan</span>, whereas the blindness at Damascus arose from the effulgence of the celestial <span class="ital">Christ</span>. And this blindness, as it had arisen supernaturally, was also supernaturally removed (<a href="/context/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost....">Acts 9:17-18</a>). That a chronic malady of the eyes should have been left behind, would be entirely opposed to the analogy of the N.T. miracles of healing, of which a <span class="ital">complete</span> cure was always the characteristic.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/galatians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-15.htm" title="Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.">Galatians 4:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">ποῦ οὖ</span> … The MSS. are decisive in favour of <span class="greekheb">ποῦ</span>, which makes excellent sense. “You congratulated yourselves,” it is urged, “on my coming among you, you welcomed me as an angel, as Christ Himself: what has become of that feeling now? where is your satisfaction at your lot?”—<span class="greekheb">ἐδώκατε</span>. Some MSS. insert <span class="greekheb">αν</span> before this verb: the addition would be necessary in Attic Greek to express the conditional force of the clause, but is not needed in Hellenistic Greek—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν</span>. The full force of <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> may be given in English by the rendering <span class="ital">your own eyes</span>: for it lays stress on the contrast between their eyes and those of Paul.

This noun occurs <a href="/romans/4-6.htm" title="Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,">Romans 4:6</a>.

The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, which is that of the best manuscripts, is now generally accepted in preference to that of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, in which, however, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> stands on a higher footing of evidence than the remaining word <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. This latter reading may be taken to mean: either, "Of what sort, then, was that gratulation of yours? "that is, what was its value in respect to the depth of conviction on which it was founded? - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="accented">qualis</span>, as <a href="/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>; <a href="/luke/19-3.htm">Luke 19:3</a>, etc., which would bring us to much the same result as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: or, "How great, then, was that gratulation of yours!" But the "then" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) comes in lamely; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("at that time") would have been more in place; and, further, it is questionable whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> of admiration ever occurs without the wonder taking a tinge of inquiry, as, for example, <a href="/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, which would be out of place here. With the more approved reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, the apostle asks, "What is, then, become of that gratulation of yourselves?" The "then" recites the fact, implied in the description given of their former behaviour, that they did once felicitate themselves on the apostle's having brought them the gospel. This is more directly brought into view in the words which follow. As the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "pronounce happy," as <a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a> and <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> denotes "pronouncing one to be happy;" as <a href="/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6, 9</a>. So Clement of Rome ('Ad Cor.,' 50), who weaves the apostle's words into his own sentence with the same meaning. This felicitation must have been pronounced by the Galatians upon themselves, not upon the apostle; the apostle would have spoken of himself on the object of their <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not of their <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For I bear</span> <span class="cmt_word">you record</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">for I bear you witness</span>; testify on your behalf; the phrase always denoting commendation (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). Compare "Ye were running well," <a href="/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>.

The omission of the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>, which is rejected by recent editors, perhaps intimates the certainty and readiness with which they would have done it; but the particle occurs very sparingly in the New Testament as compared with classical Greek. There seems something strange in the specification of this particular form of evidencing zealous attachment. If there had otherwise appeared any question of making gifts, the apostle might have been construed to mean, "Ye were ready to give me anything, your very eyes even;" but this is not the case. Possibly the particular mention of "the Churches of Galatia" in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> may have been occasioned by their having shown an especial readiness, even at the apostle's second sojourn among  them, to take part in the collection referred to; or by their having been the first Churches he came to in that particular tour, the directions which he gave to them being given also to all the Churches he went on to visit; but on this point see Introd. p. 16. The tone of <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6-10</a> does not betoken especial open-handedness on their part, unless, perhaps, the words, "let us not grow weary," hint at a liberality once displayed but now declined from. On the whole, this specification of "eyes" seems rather to point to there having been something amiss with the apostle's own eyes, either from ophthalmia or as the effect of personal outrage perpetrated upon him. It is especially deserving of notice how the apostle, in the two clauses of this verse, links together their joy in their newly found Christian blessedness with their grateful love to himself; the latter fact is adduced as proof of the former. Their gospel happiness, he feels, was indissolubly woven in with their attachment to him: if they let go their joy in Christ Jesus, as, apart from any qualification to be acquired by observances of the Law of Moses, their all-sufficient righteousness, they must also of necessity become estranged from him, who was nothing if not the exponent and herald to them of that happiness. This consideration is of great moment for the right understanding of the next verse. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?
