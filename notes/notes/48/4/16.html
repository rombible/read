In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Am I therefore become your enemy ... - Is my telling you the truth in regard to the tendency of the doctrines which you have embraced, and the character of those who have led you astray, and your own error, a proof that I have ceased to be your friend? How apt are we to feel that the man who tells us of our faults is our enemy! How apt are we to treat him coldly, and to "cut his acquaintance," and to regard him with dislike! The reason is, he gives us pain; and we cannot have pain given to us, even by the stone against which we stumble, or by any of the brute creation, without momentary indignation, or regarding them for a time as our enemies. Besides, we do not like to have another person acquainted with our faults and our follies; and we naturally avoid the society of those who are thus acquainted with us. Such is human nature; and it requires no little grace for us to overcome this. and to regard the man who tells us of our faults, or the faults of our families, as our friend.<p>We love to be flattered, and to have our friends flattered; and we shrink with pain from any exposure, or any necessity for repentance. Hence, we become alienated from him who is faithful in reproving us for our faults. Hence, people become offended with their ministers when they reprove them for their sins. Hence, they become offended at the truth. Hence, they resist the influences of the Holy Spirit, whose office it is to bring the truth to the heart, and to reprove men for their sins. There is nothing more difficult than to regard with steady and unwavering affection the man who faithfully tells us the truth at all times, when that truth is painful. Yet he is our best friend. "Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful," <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>. If I am in danger of falling down a precipice, he shows to me the purest friendship who tells me of it; if I am in danger of breathing the air of the pestilence, and it can be avoided, he shows to me pure kindness who tells me of it. So still more, if I am indulging in a course of conduct that may ruin me, or cherishing error that may endanger my salvation, he shows me the purest friendship who is most faithful in warning me, and apprising me of what must be the termination of my course. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

He plainly did not incur their enmity at his first visit, and the words here imply that he had since then, and before his now writing, incurred it: so that the occasion of his telling them the unwelcome truth, must have been at his second visit (Ac 18:23, see my [2352]Introduction).

Not that he was an enemy to them, he had the same cordial affection for them as ever; he had their true interest at heart, and was diligently pursuing it; but they, through the insinuations of the false teachers, had entertained an ill opinion of him, and an aversion to him, and treated him as if he had been an enemy to them, and as if they had a real hatred of him: and that for no other reason, as he observes, but <p>because I tell you the truth; the Gospel so called, because it comes from the God of truth, is concerned with Christ, who is truth itself, and is dictated, revealed, and blessed by the Spirit of truth; and is opposed unto, and is distinct from the law, which is only an image and shadow, and not truth itself: it chiefly respects the great truths of salvation alone by Christ, and justification by his righteousness; and may also regard what he had said concerning the abrogation of the law, blaming them for the observance of it, and calling its institutions weak and beggarly elements; all which he told or spoke publicly, plainly, honestly, fully, and faithfully, boldly, constantly, and with all assurance, consistently, and in pure love to their souls; and yet it brought on him their anger and resentment. Telling the truth in such a manner often brings many enemies to the ministers of Christ; not only the men of the world, profane sinners, but professors of religion, and sometimes such who once loved and admired them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὥστε</span>] <span class="ital">Accordingly;</span> the actual state of things which, to judge from the cooling down—which that painful question (<span class="greekheb">τίς οὖν ὁ μακαρισμὸς ὑμῶν</span>;) bewails—in the self-sacrificing love depicted in <a href="/context/galatians/4-14.htm" title="And my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus....">Galatians 4:14-15</a>, must have superseded this love, and must now subsist.[198] The words contain a profoundly melancholy exclamation: “Accordingly, that is my position; I am become your enemy!” etc. So great a change has the relation, previously so rich and happy in confidence and love, experienced <span class="ital">by the fact that it is my business to speak the truth to you</span> (mark the <span class="ital">present</span> participle <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύων</span>).

Utterly groundless, illogical, and unprecedented (for the <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span> of an inferential sentence always follows the sentence which governs it) is the inversion forced upon the apostle by Hofmann, who makes out that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὭΣΤΕ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is dependent on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΗΛΟῦΣΙΝ ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span>: “<span class="ital">so that I am now your enemy, if I tell you truth, they court you;</span>” it is the result of these courtings, that, when the apostle agreeably to the truth tells his converts (as in <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm" title="But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:8</a> f.) what is to be thought about the teaching of his opponents (?), he thereby comes to stand as their enemy. In this interpretation the special reference of <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύων ὑμῖν</span> is purely gratuitous.

I can see no reason here for making the clause interrogative: the rendering <span class="ital">I am therefore become an enemy to you</span> is quite in harmony with the context, which assumes the existence of some actual estrangement. This estrangement is attributed to plain speaking which had given offence to the disciples. As he had seen no trace of coldness at the time of his recent visit, he must be referring to some language which he had used on that occasion. Circumstances forced him to take up strong ground at that time on the subject of circumcision and to denounce the opposition and intrigues which he had encountered from the Pharisaic party.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Am I therefore</span>] ‘So that I am become … truth?’ The <span class="ital">tone</span> of the sentence is interrogative, rather than the form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I tell you the truth</span>] The reference is probably to the second visit to Galatia, when the Judaizers had begun to sow seeds of error and discord among St Paul’s converts.

If the apostle were referring only to something which had taken place at his second visit, he would have probably used different tenses; either, perhaps, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - compare <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> in <a href="/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a> (or with a contemporaneous aorist participle, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">or</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, like <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span> in <a href="/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a>. As it stands, "<span class="accented">dealing</span> with you according to truth" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) expresses the apostle's continuous declaration of the gospel, and his never-flinching ins]stance upon the mortal danger of defection from it (see <a href="/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); and "I am become your enemy" points to the result now manifesting itself from this steadfast attitude of his, in consequence of their <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of meriting his disapproval. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> occurs only once in the Septuagint - in <a href="/genesis/42-16.htm">Genesis 42:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>, "Whether there be any truth in you" (Authorized Version and Hebrew); and once besides in the New Testament - in <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span>, where the verb denotes, apparently, not merely being truthful in speech, but the whole habit of addiction both to uprightness and to God's known truth; for we can hardly leave out of our view this latter idea, when we consider how frequently the apostle designates the gospel by the term "the truth" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-8.htm">2 Corinthians 13:8</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10, 12, 13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). "Enemy" is either one regarded as adopting a hostile position to them, or one viewed with hostile feeling by them, which latter is its sense in <a href="/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>. The above exposition of the import of this verse is confirmed by the consideration that the Epistle affords no trace of the apostle's relations with the Galatian converts having been other than mutually friendly at even his second visit to them. This fact is implied in ver. 12, and <a href="/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a> furnishes no evidence to the contrary; for those warnings may have been uttered in his first visit as well as in his second, without occasioning or being occasioned by any want of mutual confidence. This view of their mutual relations is confirmed likewise by the feelings of indignant astonishment with which evidently the apostle took up his pen to address them in this letter: the tidings which had just reached him had been a painful surprise to him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Therefore (&#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Better, so then: seeing that your love for me has waned.<p>Your enemy (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x395;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; enemy, in an active sense, as is shown by the next clause. Not passive, an object of hatred, which would have the pronoun in the dative.<p>Because I tell you the truth (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x391;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>, means to speak the truth or to deal truly. The present participle refers to the same time as &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; I am become, the time of his second visit. The clause is usually construed as interrogative (A.V.). It is rather a direct statement with a slight interrogative suggestion. "So then, I am become your enemy, am I." </body></html>
