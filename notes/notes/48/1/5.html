Grace, includes God's good-will towards us, and his good work upon us; and peace, all that inward comfort, or outward prosperity, which is really needful for us. They come from God the Father, as the Fountain, through Jesus Christ. But observe, first grace, and then peace; there can be no true peace without grace. Christ gave himself for our sins, to make atonement for us: this the justice of God required, and to this he freely submitted. Here is to be observed the infinite greatness of the price bestowed, and then it will appear plainly, that the power of sin is so great, that it could by no means be put away except the Son of God be given for it. He that considers these things well, understands that sin is a thing the most horrible that can be expressed; which ought to move us, and make us afraid indeed. Especially mark well the words, for our sins. For here our weak nature starts back, and would first be made worthy by her own works. It would bring him that is whole, and not him that has need of a physician. Not only to redeem us from the wrath of God, and the curse of the law; but also to recover us from wicked practices and customs, to which we are naturally enslaved. But it is in vain for those who are not delivered from this present evil world by the sanctification of the Spirit, to expect that they are freed from its condemnation by the blood of Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To whom be glory ... - Let Him have all the praise and honor of the plan and its execution. It is not uncommon for Paul to introduce an ascription of praise in the midst of an argument: see the note at <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>.

That is, either to Christ, who gave himself to expiate the sins of his people, on the account of which all honour and glory are due to him from them; or to God the Father, according to whose will of purpose and command Christ gave himself, for which glory ought to be ascribed unto him; and it may well be thought, that both are taken into this doxology: the Father is to be glorified, who of his everlasting love, and free favour, did in his eternal purposes and decrees in his counsel and covenant, so wisely frame and order things, that his own Son should be given to be an offering for sin; and Christ is to be glorified, that he, of his free rich grace and love, agreed to give himself, and did give himself to be a ransom for his people, which has been testified in due time. This ascription of glory to both shows the greatness of the blessing, and the grateful sense which all interested in it ought to bear upon their minds continually, "for ever and ever"; or "to the ages of ages", a Jewish phrase, the same with  (c).

This doxology is not introduced as merely a reverential closing up of the greeting, before the writer hastens on to the subsequent words of rebuke. It is rather an indignant tender of homage to the Most High, flashing forth from a loyal, filial heart; confronting and seeking, so far as it thus may, to redress the wrong done to "our God and Father" by the Judaizing spirit uprearing itself among the Galatians. It is similar in tone to the indignant doxology in <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>. This view of its origin explains the fact that, as connected with a greeting, such doxology is found only in this of all St. Paul's Epistles. The indignation which pervades the tone of the whole passage favours the suppletion of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> rather than of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Perhaps, indeed <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> is in general the more natural suppletion. In <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> is added by the writer, we have not so much a direct  ascription of praise as an affirmation that to God belongs or is <span class="accented">due</span> the glory of our performing our several duties with reference to this end. In like manner in the (most probably interpolated) doxology at the close of the Lord's prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, "For thine is the kingdom," etc., the <span class="accented">ascription</span> of praise is not so much expressed as implied. Viewed in themselves, the words simply state the truth which constitutes the ground for our addressing to "our Father" our praises and our petitions. The article is most commonly prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in such ascriptions of praise, whether <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> stands alone, as <a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="/romans/16-27.htm">Romans 16:27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-21.htm">Ephesians 3:21</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-20.htm">Philippians 4:20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-21.htm">Hebrews 13:21</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>; or in conjunction with other nouns, as <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>.

When the article is added it marks the noun as expressing its notion viewed absolutely, in its entirety or universality: <span class="accented">q.d.</span> "Whatever glory is to be ascribed anywhere, be it ascribed to him." Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> is equivalent to "all glory." <span class="accented">For ever and ever</span>; literally, <span class="accented">into the aions of the aions</span>; apparently a form of expression adopted to denote intensification or superlativeness, like "holy of holies" (cf. Winer, 'Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 36, 2). It is used where <span class="accented">especial</span> intensity is wished to be added to the notion of long undetermined duration; as <a href="/revelation/14-11.htm">Revelation 14:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-7.htm">Revelation 15:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>, etc. The same notion is expressed, only with not the same passionate earnestness, by the phrase, "into the <span class="accented">aions</span>," in <a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>; <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>, etc.; and by "into the <span class="accented">aion</span>," in <a href="/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>; <a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51, 58</a>, etc. Possibly there is a reference of contrast to" this present <span class="accented">aidn"</span> of ver. 4. This, however, is doubtful; for in ver. 4 <span class="accented">aion</span> points to a particular condition of affairs subsisting in this <span class="accented">aion</span> rather than to a mere mode of duration, which latter is alone in view here.
