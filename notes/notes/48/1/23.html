It will but little avail us to have Christ revealed to us, if he is not also revealed in us. He instantly prepared to obey, without hesitating as to his worldly interest, credit, ease, or life itself.

The Gospel is called the word of faith, the mystery of faith, the faith of the Gospel, common faith, most holy faith, the faith once delivered to the saints; it contains things to be believed; it proposes and directs to the great object of faith; and is the means of implanting and increasing that grace, and without which the ministry of it is of no use: it takes in all articles of faith, respecting the divine Being, the unity of God, the trinity of persons in the Godhead, the equal and proper deity of each person, their personal distinctions from each other, the attribution of all divine works, worship and honour to them; it relates to everything concerning man, in his original creation, in his state of innocence and integrity; concerning the fall of Adam, the imputation of his sin to all his posterity, the corruption of human nature, and the impotence of man to all that is spiritually good: it regards all the acts of grace of the Father, Son, and Spirit, in and towards any of the sons of men: it includes all the doctrines of it, as of the free, sovereign, everlasting, and unchangeable love of God; of eternal, personal, and irrespective election of some to grace and glory, by which both are secured; of the everlasting, absolute, unconditional, and sure covenant of grace; of particular redemption by Christ, proceeding on a full satisfaction to divine justice; of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ; of reconciliation and pardon by his blood; of regeneration and sanctification by the Spirit; of the perseverance of the saints in faith and holiness, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal glory: now this faith, in the several momentous branches of it, the apostle preached, published, declared, spoke out openly and publicly; fully and completely, without dropping, concealing, or keeping back anything; clearly and plainly, without using ambiguous phrases, or words of double meaning, with all faithfulness and integrity, boldness and constancy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> faith which once he destroyed.</span><p>(p) The doctrine of faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/galatians/1-23.htm" title="But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed....">Galatians 1:23-24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] places <span class="greekheb">μόνον ἀκούοντες ἦσαν</span> in <span class="ital">correlation</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἤμην ἀγνοούμενος τῷ προσώπῳ</span>; it is not, however, to be understood as a mere repetition of the former <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> (Hofmann), for it introduces another[39] subject (Baeumlein, <span class="ital">Partik</span>. p. 97).

We have here the early beginnings of that objective sense in which afterwards the word got to be so commonly used in the Church to denote the Christian doctrine (see Bishop Lightfoot's essay 'Galatians,' pp. 154-158). In the second clause, "which he was sometime  making havoc of," the "faith" is identified with the Church which held it (comp. ver. 13). We may heartily accept Estius's comment, cited by Meyer, "Quia Christi fidelibus fidem extorquere nitebatur," while we still think it intolerably harsh to understand "faith," as Meyer does, in a subjective sense. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They had heard (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Correlative with I was unknown, <a href="/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>. Note the periphrasis of the participle with the substantive verb, expressing duration. They were hearing all the time that I was thus unknown to them in person.<p>The faith<p>See on <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>, and comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>. The subjective conception of faith as trustful and assured acceptance of Jesus Christ as Savior, tends to become objective, so that the subjective principle is sometimes regarded objectively. This is very striking in the Pastoral Epistles. </body></html>
