The phrase has a parallel in <a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>, and appears in its full and complete form in the Gospel saying (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>): “The Son of Man came to give His life a ransom for many “; and in <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a> : “Who gave Himself a ransom” (the word is here a compound, which brings out more strongly the sense of vicariousness) “for all.”<p><span class= "bld">For our sins.</span>—In the Greek there are three prepositions, which can only be translated by the single word “for” in English. The first has for its primary sense “concerning,” or “relating to”; it merely marks a connection or relation between two facts. The second has rather the sense “in behalf of,” “in the interests of.” The third means strictly “in place of.” The first, as might be expected, is naturally used in respect of <span class= "ital">things;</span> the second and third of <span class= "ital">persons.</span> The death of Christ was a sacrifice <span class= "ital">for sins, i.e.,</span> the sins of mankind stood in a distinct relation to it, which was really that of cause. The sins of mankind it was which set the whole scheme of redemption in motion, and to take away those sins was its main object. The death of Christ was a sacrifice <span class= "ital">for sinners.</span> It was a sacrifice wrought in their behalf, for their benefit. It was also a sacrifice wrought <span class= "ital">in their stead.</span> Christ suffered in order that they might not suffer. He gave His life “a ransom <span class= "ital">for </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., in place of</span>) many.” The first of these meanings is represented in Greek by the preposition <span class= "ital">peri,</span> the second by <span class= "ital">huper,</span> the third by <span class= "ital">anti.</span> The distinction, however, is not quite strictly kept up. We not unfrequently find the death of Christ described as a sacrifice for (<span class= "ital">on behalf of</span>) sins. This would correspond rather to our phrase “for the sake of.” The object was to do away with sins. They were, as it were, the final cause of the atonement.<p>It is somewhat doubtful which of the first two prepositions is to be read here. By far the majority of MSS. have <span class= "ital">peri,</span> but the famous Codex Vaticanus, and one of the corrections of the Sinaitic MS., have <span class= "ital">huper.</span> The two prepositions are not unfrequently confused in the MSS., and the probability in this case is that the numerical majority is right. It will then be simply stated in the text that the sins of men and the sacrifice of Christ have a relation to each other. If there had been no sin there would have been no redemption.<p><span class= "bld">Deliver us.</span>—The deliverance present to the mind of the Apostle appears to be rather (in technical language) that of sanctification than that of justification. The object of redemption is regarded for the moment as being to deliver men from sin, and not so much to deliver them from guilt, the consequence of sin. The Atonement has really both objects, but it is the first that the Apostle has in view in this passage.<p><span class= "bld">This present evil world.</span>—The reading of the three oldest and best MSS. tends rather to emphasise the word “evil”—“this present world, with all its evils.” A question is raised as to the word translated “present,” which might probably mean “impending;” but the Authorised version is probably right. “This present world” is strictly <span class= "ital">this present age.</span> The Jews divided the history of the world into two great periods—the times antecedent to the coming of the Messiah, and the period of the Messianic reign. The end of the first and the beginning of the second were to be especially attended with troubles; and it was just in this transition period—the close of the older dispensation of things—in which the Apostles regarded themselves as living. The iniquities of the Pagan society around them would naturally give them an intense longing for release; but the release which they seek is moral and spiritual. They do not so much pray that they may be “taken out of the world” as that they may be “kept from the evil.” This the Christian scheme, duly accepted and followed, would do. The Atonement free men from guilt, but its efficacy does not cease there; it sets going a train of motives which hold back the Christian from sin, and constrain him to use his best endeavours after a holy life. The Galatians had lost sight of the power of the Atonement to do this, and had fallen back upon the notion of a legal righteousness, through the vain attempt to keep the commandments of the Law.<p><span class= "bld">According to the will.</span>—The scheme of redemption was willed by God, and therefore all that was done, either on the part of man or of his Redeemer, was a carrying out of His will.<p><span class= "bld">Of God and our Father.</span>—Or, as it might be, <span class= "ital">of our God and Father.</span> It was the fatherly love of God for His creature, man, that set the work of redemption in motion; hence, in reference to the work of redemption, He is spoken of as “<span class= "ital">our</span> Father”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Father of mankind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/galatians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:...">Galatians 1:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who gave himself for our sins </span>— See on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>; <span class="ital">that he might deliver us from this present evil world </span>— From the ignorance and folly, sinfulness and guilt, corruption and misery, wherein it is involved, and from its vain and foolish customs and pleasures, that friendship and society with worldly men, and that inordinate desire after, and attachment to worldly things, which is enmity against God, <a href="/romans/8-7.htm" title="Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.">Romans 8:7</a>; <a href="/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>; <span class="ital">according to the will of God </span>— Without any merit of ours.

Grace, includes God's good-will towards us, and his good work upon us; and peace, all that inward comfort, or outward prosperity, which is really needful for us. They come from God the Father, as the Fountain, through Jesus Christ. But observe, first grace, and then peace; there can be no true peace without grace. Christ gave himself for our sins, to make atonement for us: this the justice of God required, and to this he freely submitted. Here is to be observed the infinite greatness of the price bestowed, and then it will appear plainly, that the power of sin is so great, that it could by no means be put away except the Son of God be given for it. He that considers these things well, understands that sin is a thing the most horrible that can be expressed; which ought to move us, and make us afraid indeed. Especially mark well the words, for our sins. For here our weak nature starts back, and would first be made worthy by her own works. It would bring him that is whole, and not him that has need of a physician. Not only to redeem us from the wrath of God, and the curse of the law; but also to recover us from wicked practices and customs, to which we are naturally enslaved. But it is in vain for those who are not delivered from this present evil world by the sanctification of the Spirit, to expect that they are freed from its condemnation by the blood of Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who gave himself for our sins - The reason why Paul so soon introduces this important doctrine, and makes it here so prominent, probably is, that this was the cardinal doctrine of the Christian religion, the great truth which was ever to be kept before the mind, and because this truth had been in fact lost sight of by them. They had embraced doctrines which tended to obscure it, or to make it void. They had been led into error by the Judaizing teachers, who held that it was necessary to be circumcised, and to conform to the whole Jewish ritual. Yet the tendency of all this was to obscure the doctrines of the gospel, and particularly the great truth that people can be justified only by faith in the blood of Jesus; <a href="/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-7</a>. Paul, therefore, wished to make this prominent - the very "starting point" in their religion; a truth never to be forgotten, that Christ gave himself for their sins, that he might deliver them from all the bad influences of this world, and from all the false systems of religion engendered in this world. The expression "who gave" (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  tou dontos is one that often occurs in relation to the work of the Redeemer, where it is represented as a "gift," either on the part of God, or on the part of Christ himself; see note on <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; compare <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>; <a href="/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-15.htm">2 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>. This passage proves:<p>(1) That it was wholly voluntary on the part of the Lord Jesus. No one compelled him to come; no one could compel him. It is not too much to say, that God could not, and would not compel any innocent and holy being to undertake the great work of the atonement, and endure the bitter sorrows which were necessary to redeem man. God will compel the guilty to suffer, but he never will compel the innocent to endure sorrows, even on behalf of others. The whole work of redemption must be voluntary, or it could not be performed.<p>(2) it evinced great benevolence on the part of the Redeemer. He did not come to take upon himself unknown and unsurveyed woes. He did not go to work in the dark. He knew what was to be done. He knew just what sorrows were to be endured - how long, how keen, how awful. And yet, knowing this, he came resolved and prepared to endure all those woes, and to drink the bitter cup to the dregs.<p>(3) if there had not been this benevolence in his bosom, man must have perished forever. He could not have saved himself; and he had no power or right to compel another to suffer on his behalf; and even God would not lay this mighty burden on any other, unless he was entirely willing to endure it. How much then do we owe to the Lord Jesus; and how entirely should we devote our lives to him who loved us, and gave himself for us. The word "himself," is rendered by the Syriac, "his life" (nafsh); and this is in fact the sense of the Greek, that he gave his "life" for our sins, or that he died in our stead. He gave his "life" up to toil, tears, privation, sorrow, and death, that he might redeem us. The phrase, "for our sins" (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  huper to&#772;n hamartio&#772;n he&#772;mo&#772;n), means the same as on account of; meaning, that the cause or reason why he gave himself to death, was our sins; that is, he died because we are sinners, and because we could be saved only by his giving himself up to death. Many mss. instead of (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1;  huper), here read (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;  peri), but the sense is not materially varied. The Syriac translates it, "who gave himself instead of," by a word denoting that there was a "substitution" of the Redeemer in our place. The sense is, that the Lord Jesus became a vicarious offering, and died in the stead of sinners. It is not possible to express this idea more distinctly and unambiguously than Paul has done, in this passage. Sin was the procuring cause of his death; to make expiation for sin was the design of his coming; and sin is pardoned and removed only by his substituted suffering.<p>That he might deliver us - The word used here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  exele&#772;tai) properly means, to pluck out, to tear out; to take out from a number, to select; then to rescue or deliver. This is the sense here. He came and gave himself that he might "rescue or deliver" us from this present evil world. It does not mean to take away by death, or to remove to another world, but that he might effect a separation between us and what the apostle calls here, "this present evil world." The grand purpose was, to rescue sinners from the dominion of this world, and to separate them unto God.<p>This present evil world - See <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15-16</a>. Locke supposes, that by this phrase is intended the Jewish institutions, or the Mosaical age, in contradistinction from the age of the Messiah. Bloomfield supposes, that it means "the present state of being, this life, filled as it is with calamity, sin, and sorrow; or, rather, the sin itself, and the misery consequent upon it." Rosenmuller understands by it, "the men of this age, Jews, who reject the Messiah; and pagans, who are devoted to idolatry and crime." The word rendered "world" (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;  aio&#772;n), means properly "age," an indefinitely long period of time; then eternity, forever. It then comes to mean the world, either present or future; and then the present world, as it is, with its cares, temptations, and desires; the idea of evil, physical and moral, being everywhere implied - Robinson, Lexicon; <a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>; <a href="/luke/16-8.htm">Luke 16:8</a>; <a href="/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34</a>; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>. Here it means the world as it is, without religion, a world of bad passions, false opinions, corrupt desires; a world full of ambition, and of the love of pleasure, and of gold; a world where God is not loved or obeyed; a world where people are regardless of right, and truth, and duty; where they live for themselves, and not for God; in short, that great community, which in the Scriptures is called the world, in contradistinction from the kingdom of God. That world, that evil world, is fall of sin; and the object of the Redeemer was to "deliver" us from that; that is, to effect a separation between his followers and that. It follows, therefore, that his followers constitute a unique community, not governed by the prevailing maxims, or influenced by the special feelings of the people of this world. And it follows, also, that if there is not in fact such a separation, then the purpose of the Redeemer's death, in regard to us, has not been effected, and we are still a part of that great and ungodly community, the world.<p>According to the will of God ... - Not by the will of man, or by his wisdom, but in accordance with the will of God. It was His purpose that the Lord Jesus should thus give himself; and his doing it was in accordance with His will, and was pleasing in His sight. The whole plan originated in the divine purpose, and has been executed in accordance with the divine will. If in accordance with His will, it is good, and is worthy of universal acceptation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. gave himself&#8212;(Ga 2:20); unto death, as an offering.

The Father and Son are each said to "deliver us," &c. (Col 1:13): but the Son, not the Father, gave Himself for us in order to do so, and make us citizens of a better world (Php 3:20). The Galatians in desiring to return to legal bondage are, he implies, renouncing the deliverance which Christ wrought for us. This he more fully repeats in Ga 3:13. "Deliver" is the very word used by the Lord as to His deliverance of Paul himself (Ac 26:17): an undesigned coincidence between Paul and Luke.<p>world&#8212;Greek, "age"; system or course of the world, regarded from a religious point of view. The present age opposes the "glory" (Ga 1:5) of God, and is under the authority of the Evil One.

Without merit of ours. His sovereignty as "God," and our filial relation to Him as "OUR Father," ought to keep us from blending our own legal notions (as the Galatians were doing) with His will and plan.

I see no ground for the Socinian criticism, who would have us understand by it, God’s testament, or present will for things to be done after death; the word importeth no more than God’s eternal purpose, as to the redemption of man by the blood of Christ, and his well pleasedness with his undertaking and performance of that work; this God he calleth <span class="ital">our Father, </span> not with respect to creation so much as adoption. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who gave himself for our sins,.... The antecedent to the relative "who, is our Lord Jesus Christ", <a href="/galatians/1-3.htm">Galatians 1:3</a> and the words are an illustration of the good will of God the Father, and of the grace and love of Christ, in the gift of himself, for the sins of his people: he did not merely give, "sua, his own things", what were his properly, but, "se, himself"; not the world, and the fulness of it, gold, silver, and such like corruptible things; no, nor men for them, and people for their lives; nor angels, his creatures, and ministering spirits; but his own self, his life, his flesh, his blood, his body, and soul, his whole human nature, and this as in union with himself, a divine person, the eternal Son of God. He gave himself freely, cheerfully, voluntarily, into the hands of men, justice, and death itself, as a sacrifice for sin, to expiate it, make reconciliation and atonement for it, which could not be done by the sacrifices of the legal dispensation; to procure the remission of it, which could not be had without shedding or blood; and utterly to take it away, finish it, and make an end of it, and abolish it, so as that it might never rise any more to the condemnation of his people: and this reached to "sins" of all sorts, not only original, but actual, and these of thought, word, and deed; and this oblation of himself upon the cross, was not for any sin of his own, who had none, nor for the sins of angels, of whom he was no Redeemer aud Saviour, but "for our sins"; not the sins of the apostles, or of the Jews only, nor yet of all mankind, but of God's elect, called the friends of Christ, his sheep and church, for whom he gave himself; and his end in so doing was, <p>that he might deliver us from this present evil world; by which is meant, either the Jewish world, or church state, in which were a worldly sanctuary, and which were subject to ceremonies and traditions, called the elements and rudiments of the world; and who were possessed of worldly notions, and in expectation of a worldly kingdom to be set up by the Messiah; and both in principle and in practice were sadly degenerated, and were become very evil and wicked: or the present age and generation of men, whether of Jews or Gentiles, which was so corrupt, as the like was never known; or in general the present world, and the men of it, in distinction either from the world before the flood, as in <a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a> or rather from the new heavens and earth, which will be after the present ones, and wherein will dwell righteousness; or, in a word, from the world which is to come, as they are frequently opposed in Scripture: and which is said to be "evil", not with respect to the matter, that being all very good, as created by God; but with respect to the men of it, who lie in wickedness, under the power of the wicked one, and of their own sins; and to the things which are in it, all which are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Now Christ gave himself a sacrifice for the sins of his people, that as in consequence of this they might be delivered and saved from the damning power, so from the governing power and influence of all that is evil in this present world; as from Satan, the god of it, who has usurped a power over it; from the lusts that are predominant in it; from the vain conversation of the men of it; from the general conflagration of it at the last day, and from the perdition of ungodly men, and their eternal destruction in hell: and all this is <p>according to the will of God, and our Father, It was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God that Christ was delivered up into the hands of wicked men, and put to death by them; it was his will of purpose and decree, to deliver him up into the hands of justice and death, and that he should give himself sacrifice for sin; yea, it was his will of command, that he should lay down his life for his sheep, to which he was obedient; it was his pleasure, it was what was agreeable to him, was to his good liking, that he should die for the sins of his people; it was owing to the love of God, who is our Father in Christ, and by adopting grace, and not to any worth or desert of ours, that Christ gave himself for us; as his own love, so his Father's will, were what solely moved him to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> world, according to the will of God and our Father:</span><p>(2) The sum of the true Gospel is this, that Christ by his offering alone saves us who are chosen out of the world, by the free decree of God the Father.<p>(d) Out of that most corrupt state which is without Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/1-4.htm" title="Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:">Galatians 1:4</a>.

The two prepositions are combined in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1 Peter 3:18</a>. It is often difficult to decide which is the genuine reading owing to the variation of MSS.: but here they are greatly in favour of <span class="greekheb">περί</span>, which is also more appropriate to the context: for in this clause a comparison is intended between the sin-offerings of Christ and the typical sin-offerings of the Law; while the next expresses the motive of the Saviour by the addition <span class="greekheb">ὅπως ἐξέληται</span> …—<span class="greekheb">αἰῶνος</span>. In early Greek this word denoted the appointed lifetime of man, and so combined the thought of an overruling destiny with the course of human life. From the conception of individual life was developed that of corporate life, whether of families, nations or societies, and the idea of divine appointment was more distinctly fastened on the word in Scripture, so that every successive dispensation of God was designated as an <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span>. In this place <span class="greekheb">αἰῶνος</span> denotes the world which Jesus found existing at the time of His coming, out of which He chose His disciples. <span class="ital">World</span> is the nearest English equivalent to <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> in this sense, if only it be understood to mean a particular phase of human society, as in the phrases <span class="ital">religious world, scientific world</span>, etc., and not the material universe.—<span class="greekheb">ἐνεστῶτος</span>: <span class="ital">existing</span>. This participle is twice elsewhere applied to things existing by way of contrast to things future (<span class="greekheb">μέλλοντα</span>), in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>. A similar contrast is here suggested between <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐνεστώς</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ μέλλων αἰών</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, between the world which Christ found existing on earth and the Messianic world whose coming Hebrew prophets had foretold.—<span class="greekheb">πονηροῦ</span>. This sweeping condemnation of the existing world corresponds to the language of the Baptist and to Christ’s own denunciations of the evil generation to which He came. In spite of all that revelation and conscience had done to leaven it, He found the faithful few in number, and evil predominant in the mass.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξέληται</span>. Here, as in <a href="/acts/26-17.htm" title="Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,">Acts 26:17</a>, this verb coupled with <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> can only denote <span class="ital">choice out of</span> the world, not <span class="ital">deliverance from</span> it, which would require the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἐκ χειρός</span>, as in <a href="/acts/12-11.htm" title="And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD has sent his angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.">Acts 12:11</a>, or some equivalent. The clause describes the process of selection begun by Christ on earth, and still continued by the risen Christ as He calls fresh disciples into His Church continually.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">who gave himself … our Father</span>] The Apostle here prepares the way for the discussion of his great subject. He cannot think of the Gospel—pardon, justification, acceptance with God, and eternal life—apart from the atoning death of Christ. The efficacy of that “precious death” depends on the voluntary surrender of Himself by our Blessed Lord, “to reconcile His Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.” (Article 11.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">who gave himself</span>] The Father gave the Son. The Son gave Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for our sins</span>] not merely to denounce sin—Moses and the prophets had done this; not merely to set us a perfect example—this would have been to mock the misery of unpardoned, unsanctified men and women. His death was <span class="ital">for</span> our sins. The exact force of the preposition may fall short of asserting the <span class="ital">vicarious</span> nature of our Lord’s sacrifice—indeed the reading of the Original is not free from doubt. But the Apostle’s language is in entire accord with his teaching elsewhere, and must be so explained.

It is also “the keynote of this Epistle”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from this present evil world</span>] World, lit. age. The Greek word signifies, the present state of things, the world’s life, regarded in its transitory nature, as a condition of existence, rather than the material creation. Matter is not essentially evil. It becomes an instrument of evil by reason of man’s transgression of the law of God. There is a similar usage in the familiar expression of the Roman historian ‘Corrumpere et corrumpi sæculum vocatur,’ Tac. <span class="ital">Germ</span>. 17; compare ‘fecunda culpæ sæcula,’ of Horace. Two other renderings of the phrase are admissible; (1) from the present (or besetting) evil of the world; or (2) from the evil of the present world. Our Lord prayed for His disciples, not that they should be taken out of the world, but that they should be kept from the evil; and He has taught us to pray, ‘Deliver us from the evil.’ There is however a true sense in which Christians are delivered, rescued from this present evil age or dispensation, from its power and its contamination—a dispensation so often contrasted with “that world” (<a href="/luke/20-35.htm" title="But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:">Luke 20:35</a>) into which sin and defilement cannot enter.

This is the strongest imaginable description of what Christ did to redeem us. The phrase occurs in 1 Macc. 6:44, with reference to the Eleazar who rushed upon certain death to kill the elephant which was carrying the king, Antiochus: "He gave himself (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) to save his people." It is applied to Christ also in <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>," Who gave himself for us;" and <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>, "Who gave himself a ransom for all." In the next chapter, ver. 20, the apostle writes, "Who loved me, and gave himself up (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) for me." Similarly, St. Paul writes  in <a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>, "He that spared not [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'kept not back'] his own Son, but gave him <span class="accented">up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) for us all." The addition, in <a href="/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>, of the words, "into the hands of sinners," and our Lord's utterance in <a href="/luke/22-53.htm">Luke 22:53</a>, "This is your hour, and the power of darkness," help to illustrate the exceedingly pregnant expression now before us. <span class="cmt_word">For our sins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is the reading of the Textus Receptus, retained by the Revisers. On the other hand, L. T. Tr., for <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, substitute <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>.

If we follow the reading of Rec. L. T. Tr. Rev. (for very often the manuscripts oscillate between the two), we have <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, "Died for our sins;" <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, "To offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people;" <a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>, "Blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the ignorances of the people." On the other hand, we find in the same authorities <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "Sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin;" <a href="/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a>, "As for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins" (where, however, the Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in the last clause, ("for sins"); <a href="/hebrews/10-6.htm">Hebrews 10:6</a>, "Whole burnt offerings, and <span class="accented">sacrifices</span> for sin;" <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>, "No more offering for sin;" <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2, 10</a>, "Propitiation for our sins;" <a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>, "Died [or, 'suffered'] for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) sins, the righteous for (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>) the unrighteous." The last passage (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>) suggests the remark that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> is the more appropriate word before persons, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> before "sins." We find, however, that, in the Septuagint, in the Pentateuch <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> is used also before persons as it is in <a href="/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a>; thus: <a href="/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a>, "The priest shall make atonement for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> him concerning (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) his ignorance;" in both cases rendering the Hebrew <span class="accented">al.</span> So <a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20, 26, 31, 35</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-12.htm">Numbers 8:12</a>. On the other hand, in <a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30</a> we have "I will go up unto the Lord, that I may make atonement for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">b'ad</span>) your sin." The truth seems to be that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, which is more properly "on behalf of" often denotes "for," equivalent to "on account of;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>, Septuagint, "rebukes for sin;" <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>, "Giving thanks always for all things;" <a href="/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>, "Glorify God for his mercy." And this sense passes into "concerning," "with reference to;" as <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>, "I would not have you ignorant concerning our affliction;" <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>, "Whether <span class="accented">any inquire</span> about Titus." On the other hand, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, which more properly denotes "concerning," "with reference to," passes into the sense of "on account of;" as <a href="/luke/19-37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>, "Praise God for all the mighty works;" <a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy;" <a href="/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>, "I thank my God... concerning you;" <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>, "We give thanks to God for you all;" <a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>, "I thank my God for [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>] you all." The use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in the verse before us, and in the similar passages above cited, no doubt followed its use in the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which in the LXX. so commonly describes the "sin offering" of the Levitical institute. This phrase sometimes represents what in the Hebrew text is the simple noun (<span class="accented">chattath</span>) "sin," put for "sin offering;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>, "This is the law ofthe burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering (<span class="accented">chattath</span>)," etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.). Sometimes it represents the same Hebrew noun preceded by the preposition <span class="accented">al</span>, for: "For the sin of such or such a one (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>);" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/leviticus/5.htm">Leviticus 5</a>:35, where the LXX. has, "The priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he hath sinned (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>)." The precise force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in this phrase was probably "on account of sin," or "having reference to sin;" senses of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> which, as has been seen, are borne by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> as well. This view of the force of these two prepositions, as employed in this relation, seems to the present writer more satisfactory than that which refers it to the notion of protection, "on behalf of" or "for the good of" some one; though it must unquestionably be allowed that this is a notion which they both of them frequently convey. To this latter notion, indeed, we must in all probability refer the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, "Gave himself up for me," as well as in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18, 6</a>, for the unrighteous;" <a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19, 20</a>, "Given for you,"  "Poured out for you," and the like; and also that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>, "Shed for many;" <a href="/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> pray for them;" <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>, "Praying for us." The result of this inquiry into the <span class="accented">usus loquendi</span> with reference to these prepositions appears to be this: in what manner the death of Christ affected our condition in those respects in which that condition was antecedently qualified by our sins, neither <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> nor <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> as prefixed to the noun "sins" enables us precisely to determine, further than as it recalls for illustration the "sin offering" of the Law. For the more complete development of the idea intended to be conveyed, we must look to other references made in Scripture to the subject, such as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>. Thus much, however, we may confidently assume: both <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> as so applied do alike warrant us in concluding, not only that it was because of our sins that Christ behoved to die, but also that his death is efficacious for the complete removal of those evils which accrue to us from our sins. That he might deliver us from this present  evil world (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>.

We are, therefore, naturally led to suppose that the apostle means to contrast the "world" here referred to with a "world to come;" which latter is mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>, and seems synonymous with the "world [literally, 'inhabited earth'] to come," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, of <a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>. Compare our Lord's words in <a href="/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>, "Neither in this world nor in that which is to come," and his contrast of "this world" with "that world" in <a href="/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34, 35</a>. The Greek word here employed, <span class="accented">aion</span>, like <span class="accented">kosmos</span>, is used with varying shades of meaning. The two nouns, used interchangeably in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18, 19</a> are, however, not altogether equivalent. The former originally denotes a mode of time; the latter, a mode of space. In particular, <span class="accented">aion</span> is never used in the Greek Testament to denote "mankind," as <span class="accented">kosmos</span> not unfrequently is by all its writers. In the Syriac Version, <span class="accented">olmo</span> represents both <span class="accented">aion</span> and <span class="accented">kosmos</span> in all their senses, with a slight variation in its form to represent <span class="accented">aion</span> in <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, "The course (<span class="accented">aida</span>) of this world (<span class="accented">kosmos</span>)," as if it were "The worldliness of this world." Probably the same word <span class="accented">olmo</span>, in the Chaldean-Hebrew language current amongst the Palestinian Jews, was the term employed by them in all those connections in which either <span class="accented">aion</span> or <span class="accented">kosmos</span> would have been used by them if speaking in Hellenistic Greek; for it is to the Hellenistic dialect of the Greek language that both words as so employed belong. We never find <span class="accented">aion</span> at all in any of St. John's writings, except in the phrases, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, denoting "for ever." In other significations, when other writers of the New Testament might have used <span class="accented">aion</span>, St. John always puts <span class="accented">kosmos.</span> The word <span class="accented">aion</span>, denoting a cycle of time, is used also to signify a material world, as <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; and, in particular, the state of things found existing in that cycle of time; and this as viewed in various aspects. In <a href="/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34, 35</a> "this <span class="accented">aida"</span> contrasts the present state, as one of mortality and successive reproduction, with "that <span class="accented">aion</span>," viewed as one of immortality, in which processes of reproduction are found no more. But in <a href="/luke/16-8.htm">Luke 16:8</a> "the children of this <span class="accented">aion"</span> are those who live after the world-loving, sinful fashion which characterizes mankind in general in contrast with "the children of light," who have been enlightened to recognize their relation to a spiritual world. In St. Paul, "the present <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> denotes the entire moral and spiritual state of mankind viewed in the aspect in which he contemplated it - a state wrapped in spiritual "darkness," pervaded by ungodliness and general immorality, and dominated by Satan; as Bengel puts it, "tota oeconomia peceati sub potestate Satanae" (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>); a state from which Christians ought to study to get wholly weaned in all their moral and spiritual habits (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>). In St. John, the phrases, "the world (<span class="accented">kosmos</span>)," or "this world" are frequently employed to express the same idea; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>. Out of this "power, empire, of darkness," in which by nature apart from Christ's grace all men are hopelessly enthralled; out of the grasp, inextricable by any efforts of their own, with which Satan holds them, - the apostle recognizes Christ as alone able to "rescue" us; and even him only able to "<span class="accented">rescue"</span> us by virtue of his atoning sacrifice of himself Thus, in an eminently just application of the verb, he is said to "redeem" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) them from all iniquity, which expression includes, not only the idea of his paying down a ransom for their emancipation, but also the thought that, by the power of his grace, he makes the ransom effectual for the actual moral and spiritual deliverance, one by one, of those who believe in him: "he purifies them a people of his very own, devoted to good works" (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>). The position in the Greek of the epithet "evil," standing in a peculiar manner without the article after "this present world" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), is discussed both by Bishop Ellicott and by Bishop) Lightfoot in their respective Commentaries on the Epistle; the latter of whom takes it as equivalent to "<span class="accented">with</span> all its evils." It seems to the present writer that the syntax of the clause groups it with <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>," That which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made [or, 'done '] with hands (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>),<span class="accented">"</span> where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> has no article, because it is a logical adjunct: the circumcision "which is made in the flesh with hands," is of course no real circumcision (cf. <a href="/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. fin.), and there-fore is only one so "called." So in the present passage the epithet "evil" is a logical adjunct: the state of the world being an "evil state," craved Christ's redemption,  and this fact should make that redemption welcome to us. Similarly, in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a> the epithet" handed from your fathers (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)," added after "your vain manner of life," is a logical adjunct: the fact that it was ancient and traditional gave it so strong a hold upon them as to crave the intervention of a no ordinary ransom to redeem them from it. With the turn of thought, which according to this view is indicated by the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> having been added to the noun without the article, agrees likewise the emphatic position of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> at the Lead of the sentence. Christ gave his own very self for this end, that he might <span class="accented">deliver</span> us out of this wretched state of things to which we belonged. But the reactionary movement now showing itself among the Galatians would inevitably, the apostle feels (see <a href="/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>), have the effect of making void this redeeming work of Christ, and of involving them afresh in their original misery. If we adhere to the reading in the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, we had best, perhaps, accept Winer's proposal ('Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 20, 1 <span class="accented">a</span>), and explain the absence of the article by supposing <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> as forming one notion, as in the case of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;</span>. in the Textus Receptus of <a href="/1_corinthians/10-3.htm">1 Corinthians 10:3</a>. But this reading, though grammatically it runs more smoothly than the other, is on that very account the less likely to have been the original one, and seems greatly to blunt the significance of the adjective. May we not detect in this epithet "evil" the sound of a sigh, drawn from the apostle's heart by this flesh worry and disappointment now cropping up for him and for all who cared for the success of the gospel? His feeling seems to be - Oh the weary evilness of this present state! When will it be brought to an end by the appearing of that blissful hope? (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the will of God and our Father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">according to the will of our God and Father. It is</span>, perhaps, of no great consequence whether we understand this clause as pointing to the whole preceding sentence, "Who gave himself...  world," or to the last clause of it, "That he might deliver...  world." But the former is the more probable construction: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> there is no reason for restricting it to the last words; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is in perfect accordance with the apostle's usual reference of Christ's coming into the world and dying for us to the Father's appointment, that he should here too be understood as referring to this work of delivering grace also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The feeling apparently underlies these words of the apostle, that the Judaizing which he has now before his eyes was both setting itself in opposition to the supreme ordering of "our God" - and <span class="accented">his</span> sovereign "will" who of us shall dare to contravene?  - and also thwarting the operation of his <span class="accented">fatherly</span> loving-kindness. For the lack of filial confidence in God's love to us, and the slavish ceremonialism which characterized Judaical legalism, were both of them adjuncts of the unspiritual mind still in bondage to "the flesh" (cf. <a href="/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. and 8.), and therefore part and parcel of "this present world." Comp. <a href="/galatians/3-3.htm">Galatians 3:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 8-10</a>; and <a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>," Why, as living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, Handle not," etc.? As Professor Jowett observes, in this case as well as in the Epistle to the Romans, "The salutation is the proem of the whole Epistle." The expression, "<span class="accented">our</span> God and Father," is pathetic; it is an outcome of the deep complacency with which the apostle cherishes the assurance of God's fatherly love given us in the gospel - a sentiment of complacency stimulated into increased fervency by antagonism to the spiritual mischief confronting him. <span class="accented">Of our God and Father.</span> So Revised Version. This rendering appears decidedly preferable to that given by the Authorized Version, "of God and our Father," though grammatically this latter is confessedly not inadmissible. The like remark applies to all the other passages in the New Testament in which <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> is found followed by a genitive; namely, by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>); by <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> as in the passage before us (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:11, 13</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-20.htm">Philippians 4:20</a>); by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>); by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a> [L.
