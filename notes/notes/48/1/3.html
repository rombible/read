Grace, includes God's good-will towards us, and his good work upon us; and peace, all that inward comfort, or outward prosperity, which is really needful for us. They come from God the Father, as the Fountain, through Jesus Christ. But observe, first grace, and then peace; there can be no true peace without grace. Christ gave himself for our sins, to make atonement for us: this the justice of God required, and to this he freely submitted. Here is to be observed the infinite greatness of the price bestowed, and then it will appear plainly, that the power of sin is so great, that it could by no means be put away except the Son of God be given for it. He that considers these things well, understands that sin is a thing the most horrible that can be expressed; which ought to move us, and make us afraid indeed. Especially mark well the words, for our sins. For here our weak nature starts back, and would first be made worthy by her own works. It would bring him that is whole, and not him that has need of a physician. Not only to redeem us from the wrath of God, and the curse of the law; but also to recover us from wicked practices and customs, to which we are naturally enslaved. But it is in vain for those who are not delivered from this present evil world by the sanctification of the Spirit, to expect that they are freed from its condemnation by the blood of Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grace be unto you ... - This is the usual apostolic salutation, imploring for them the blessing of God.

It is nevertheless conceivable that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, as used in Hellenistic Greek, may at times have widened the sense proper to it in ordinary Greek into the more comprehensive import of the <span class="accented">shalom</span>, which it was regularly employed to represent. <span class="cmt_word">From God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). These words regularly form a part in the apostle's formula of greeting. With slight variations they are found in all his Epistles, except, perhaps, the First to the Thessalonians, where, though read in the Textus Receptus, they are omitted by recent editors. "Our" is added to "Father" in at least seven of St. Paul's Epistles (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon). This warrants the belief that, when as in 1 Timothy, Titus, and here, he wrote "God the Father," he most probably did so with reference to God's fatherly relation to the members of Christ's Church. Tregelles and the margin of the revised Greek text, in fact, read <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> here, omitting it after <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Uniformly in this formula of greeting we find only one preposition, "from" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>), before the two names, "God" and "Jesus Christ;" as in the first verse in this Epistle there is only one preposition, "<span class="accented">through</span>," before "Jesus Christ" and "God." The apostle, looking upwards, discerns, as St. Stephen did, in the ineffable glory, the supreme God in whom he recognizes "our Father," and with him Jesus Christ, "our Lord;" that is, our Master, Head, Mediator, "<span class="accented">through</span> whom are all things, and we through him." Grace and peace coming down from heaven, must come <span class="accented">from</span> God our Father <span class="accented">and</span> Jesus Christ our Lord. From the very nature of the case it is obvious that the blessings referred to come to us <span class="accented">through</span> Christ, though also "<span class="accented">from"</span> him; as also that St. Paul's delegation as apostle, spoken of in the first verse, originated <span class="accented">from</span> a volition and appointment of God the Father, as well as was brought about "<span class="accented">through"</span> the ordering of his providence. But in each case the preposition used by the apostle preserves its proper force, not to be confused by our thrusting into it another notion not just then in the writer's view. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Grace to you, etc.<p>See on <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>.
