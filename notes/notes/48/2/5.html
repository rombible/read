This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour - We did not submit to this at all. We did not yield even for the shortest time. We did not waver in our opposition to their demands, or in the slightest degree become subject to their wishes. We steadily opposed their claims, in order that the great principle might be forever settled, that the laws of Moses were not to be imposed as obligatory on the Gentile converts. This I take to be the clear and obvious sense of this passage, though there has been a great variety of opinions on it. A considerable number of manuscripts omit the words &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;  hois oude), "to whom neither" (see Mill, Koppe, and Griesbach), and then the sense would be reversed, that Paul did yield to them for or after a short time, in order that he might in this way better consult the permanent interests of the gospel. This opinion has been gaining ground for the last century, that the passage here has been corrupted; but it is by no means confirmed. The ancient versions (the Syriac, the Vulgate, and the Arabic) accord with the usual reading of the text. So also do by far the largest portion of mss., and such, it seems to me, is the sense demanded by the connection. Paul means, in the whole passage, to say, that a great principle was settled. That the question came up fairly whether the Mosaic rites were to be imposed upon Gentile converts. That false brethren were introduced who demanded it; and that he steadily maintained his ground. He did not yield a moment. He felt that a great principle was involved; and though on all proper occasions he was willing to yield and to become all things to all men, yet here he did not court them, or temporize with them in the least. The phrase "by subjection" here means, that he did not suffer himself to be compelled to yield. The phrase "for an hour" is equivalent to the shortest period of time. He did not waver, or yield at all.<p>That the truth of the gospel might continue with you - That the great principle of the Christian religion which had been taught you might continue, and that you might enjoy the full benefit of the pure gospel, without its being intermingled with any false views. Paul had defended these same views among the Galatians, and he now sought that the same views might be confirmed by the clear decision of the college of apostles at Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Greek, "To whom not even for an hour did we yield by subjection." Alford renders the Greek article, "with THE subjection required of us." The sense rather is, We would willingly have yielded for love [Bengel] (if no principle was at issue), but not in the way of subjection, where "the truth of the Gospel" (Ga 2:14; Col 1:5) was at stake (namely, the fundamental truth of justification by faith only, without the works of the law, contrasted with another Gospel, Ga 1:6).

Or, (as others think), to which men <span class="ital">of reputation</span> we yielded not in the least. It is very probable, that Peter and James, upon their first arguing the case, to avoid the scandal and offence of the Jews, would have had Titus circumcised: St. Paul would not yield to it, that he might preserve the doctrine of the gospel, which he had planted amongst the Galatians, and other Gentiles, pure, and not encumber those churches with the Mosaical rites.

Meaning not the apostles, elders, and brethren at Jerusalem, who did not insist upon the observance of the rituals of the law as necessary, but were one and all of opinion that the Gentiles should be free from them; but the false teachers with whom they combated, and would not yield in the least unto, so as to be brought into subjection to their impositions, nor suffer others to yield unto them: <p>no, not for an hour; for the least space of time, knowing what advantages and improvements would be made of it, should they allow of the use of these things as necessary for any short time, though it should be agreed then to drop them. This is a way of speaking used by the Jews, when they would express their steady adherence to any principle or practice; of which take the following instance from Gamaliel (c): <p>"it happened to Rabban Gamaliel, that he read the first night he was married; his disciples said to him, master, hast thou not taught us, that the bridegroom is free from reading the Shema, i.e. "hear, O Israel", &amp;c. the first night? he replied to them, I will not hearken to you to cause to cease from me the yoke of the kingdom of heaven,  , "even one hour".'' <p>The reason why the apostle, and others with him, were so resolute and pertinacious in this matter was, <p>that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you; with the Galatians in particular, and with all the Gentiles in general, which otherwise would have been in danger of being entirely removed from them, at least of being adulterated and mixed with the Mosaic rites, and the inventions of men; whereas the apostle's desire was, that, the Gospel might be continued with them genuine, sincere, and unmixed, in opposition to the shadows of the law, and the false doctrines of men. <p>(c) Misn.

These last used advice and persuasion; the false brethren demanded with clamour (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, <a href="/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>). The phrase rendered <span class="accented">for an hour</span> occurs also <a href="/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15</a>. There seems to be an underlying allusion to those occasions on which the apostle did, as he says, "to the Jews become as a Jew, to the weak, weak" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20, 22</a>); but this he would not do when dealing with false brethren, whose aim was in effect to turn gospel freedom into legal slavery. <span class="accented">We</span>; I, Barnabas, Titus. The words <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> most certainly belong to the original text. Not merely does only one uncial manuscript omit them, but their omission would leave behind a sentence self-convicted of absurdity. For it would run thus: "But because of the false brethren without warrant brought in, a set of men who without warrant came in to spy out our liberty, that they might degrade us into slavery, we yielded for a season with subjection, that the truth of the gospel might lastingly abide with you;" - yielded, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by circumcising Titus; for this is what this reading most probably supposes St. Paul to have done. In this sentence the vituperative description of the false brethren, so extended and so intensely emphatic, instead of being an implied argument in favour of the course of action which the apostle states he adopted, namely, concession to those men, both lacks all motive for its introduction here, and works wholly in favour of the opposite course, of resistance to their wishes. The only suitable and logical description of those for whose sake the concession would have been made would have been that they were brethren meaning well, but weak in the faith, who should, by concession for a season, be won over to more perfect accord with the gospel. (On this reading, see Alford, and the fuller discussion of it in Bishop Lightfoot, pp. 121-123.) <span class="accented">By subjection</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>): <span class="accented">in the way of subjection.</span> As <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> In the other passages in which it occurs means the habit or spirit of subjection, and never an act of submission (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>), it probably denotes here subjection of spirit to those who were so authoritatively laying upon us their injunctions, he might give way in a point of this kind in a spirit of brotherly concession; but he would bow to no man's imperative injunction. The article before <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span> is the article before an abstract noun, as in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That the truth of the gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The truth, the sure unadulterated doctrine,  which is embodied in the gospel, and is its very hinge and substance. The same phrase is found in <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>. The "truth" is that enunciated in ver. 16, and that it is the very essence of the gospel is declared <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. The refusal of Church fellowship to a believer of this gospel except he were circumcised, by just inference vitiated and, indeed, nullified the truth that faith in Christ is the sole and sufficient ground of justification. <span class="cmt_word">Might continue with you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). Might never cease to have its home with you, to be believingly entertained by you. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is an intensified form of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>, where see note. It is possible that, as Alford observes, the Galatians may not specially have been in St. Paul's mind at that time, but only the Gentile Churches in general; and that for greater impressiveness he applies to the particular what was only shared by it in the general. It is, however, supposable that the cases of the several Churches which he had then lately founded with Barnabas were much in his thoughts at that time; for, as is shown by his numerous references to his specific intercessory prayer, his spirit was incessantly conversant with "all the Churches" (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>); and he was anxiously cognizant of efforts made from the very first by legalizing Christians to pervert their faith. It is not certain that <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a> records the first occasion of his visiting the "Galatic country;" he may have been there and founded "the Churches of Galatia" before the occurrences described in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; and the opinion is even held by many that Iconium and Derbe, belonging to the Roman province of Galatia, were two of "the Churches of Galatia" (see Introduction, p. 2). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We gave place by subjection (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)<p>We, Paul and Barnabas.
