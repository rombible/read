The “I” of <a href="/galatians/2-18.htm" title="For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.">Galatians 2:18</a> is really St. Peter or the Judaisers; the “I” of this verse is St. Paul himself. The object of his appeal is to make good his assertion that to restore the dethroned Law to its old position is positively sinful.<p>Once having done with the Law I had done with it for ever. The Law itself had prepared me for this. It was a stage which I could not but pass through, but which was in its very nature temporary. It carried with it the sentence of its own dissolution.<p><span class= "bld">For . . .</span>—This assigns the reason for the use of the word “transgressor” in the verse before. It is a transgression to rebuild the demolished fabric of the Law, because the true Christian has done with the Law once for all.<p><span class= "bld">Through the law am dead to the law.</span>—In what sense can this be said? The Apostle himself had got rid of his obligations to the Law—not, however, by simply evading them from the first, but by passing through a period of subjection to them. The road to freedom from the Law lay through the Law. The Law, on its prophetic side, pointed to Christ. The Law, on its moral side, held up an ideal to which its votaries could not attain. It did not help them to attain to it. It bore the stamp of its own insufficiency. Men broke its precepts, and its weakness seemed to lead up to a dispensation that should supersede its own. St. Paul would not have become a Christian if he had not first sat at the feet of Gamaliel. If we could trace the whole under-current of silent, and perhaps only half-conscious, preparation, which led to the Apostle’s conversion, we should see how large a part was played in it by the sense, gradually wrought in him, of the Law’s insufficiency. Thus the negative side was given by his own private meditation; the positive side, faith in Christ, was given by the vision on the road to Damascus.<p><span class= "bld">That I might live unto God.</span>—We might not unnaturally expect here “unto Christ,” instead of “unto God.” But the Christian lives unto Christ <span class= "ital">in</span> <span class= "ital">order that</span> he may live unto God. The ultimate object of the Christian scheme is that he may be presented righteous before God. By the Law he could not obtain this righteousness. It is obtained in Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:15-19 Paul, having thus shown he was not inferior to any apostle, not to Peter himself, speaks of the great foundation doctrine of the gospel. For what did we believe in Christ? Was it not that we might be justified by the faith of Christ? If so, is it not foolish to go back to the law, and to expect to be justified by the merit of moral works, or sacrifices, or ceremonies? The occasion of this declaration doubtless arose from the ceremonial law; but the argument is quite as strong against all dependence upon the works of the moral law, as respects justification. To give the greater weight to this, it is added, But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ the minister of sin? This would be very dishonourable to Christ, and also very hurtful to them. By considering the law itself, he saw that justification was not to be expected by the works of it, and that there was now no further need of the sacrifices and cleansings of it, since they were done away in Christ, by his offering up himself a sacrifice for us. He did not hope or fear any thing from it; any more than a dead man from enemies. But the effect was not a careless, lawless life. It was necessary, that he might live to God, and be devoted to him through the motives and grace of the gospel. It is no new prejudice, though a most unjust one, that the doctrine of justification by faith alone, tends to encourage people in sin. Not so, for to take occasion from free grace, or the doctrine of it, to live in sin, is to try to make Christ the minister of sin, at any thought of which all Christian hearts would shudder.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I through the law - On this passage the commentators are by no means agreed. It is agreed that in the phrase "am dead to the law," the Law of Moses is referred to, and that the meaning is, that Paul had become dead to that as a ground or means of justification. He acted as though it were not; or it ceased to have influence over him. A dead man is insensible to all around him. He hears nothing; sees nothing; and nothing affects him. So when we are said to be dead to anything, the meaning is, that it does not have an influence over us. In this sense Paul was dead to the Law of Moses. He ceased to observe it as a ground of justification. It ceased to be the grand aim and purpose of his life, as it had been formerly, to obey it. He had higher purposes than that, and truly lived to God; see the note at <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>. But on the meaning of the phrase "through the law" (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  dia nomou) there has been a great variety of opinion.<p>Bloomfield, Rosenmuller, and some others suppose that he means the Christian religion, and that the meaning is, "by one law, or doctrine, I am dead to another;" that is, the Christian doctrine has caused me to cast aside the Mosaic religion. Doddridge, Clarke, Chandler, and most others, however, suppose that he here refers to the Law of Moses, and that the meaning is, that by contemplating the true character of the Law of Moses itself; by considering its nature and design; by understanding the extent of its requisitions, he had become dead to it; that is, he had laid aside all expectations of being justified by it. This seems to me to be the correct interpretation. Paul had formerly expected to be justified by the Law. He had endeavored to obey it. It had been the object of his life to comply with all its requisitions in order to be saved by it; <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-6</a>. But all this while he had not fully understood its nature; and when he was made fully to feel and comprehend its spiritual requirements, then all his hopes of justification by it died, and he became dead to it; see this sentiment more fully explained in the note at <a href="/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9</a>.<p>That I might live unto God - That I might be truly alive, and might be found engaged in his service. He was dead to the Law, but not to every thing. He had not become literally inactive and insensible to all things, like a dead man, but he had become truly sensible to the commands and appeals of God, and had consecrated himself to his service; see the note at <a href="/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Here Paul seems to pass from his exact words to Peter, to the general purport of his argument on the question. However, his direct address to the Galatians seems not to be resumed till Ga 3:1, "O foolish Galatians," &c.<p>For&#8212;But I am not a "transgressor" by forsaking the law. "For," &c. Proving his indignant denial of the consequence that "Christ is the minister of sin" (Ga 2:17), and of the premises from which it would follow. Christ, so far from being the minister of sin and death, is the establisher of righteousness and life. I am entirely in Him [Bengel].<p>I&#8212;here emphatical. Paul himself, not Peter, as in the "I" (Ga 2:18).<p>through the law&#8212;which was my "schoolmaster to bring me to Christ" (Ga 3:24); both by its terrors (Ga 3:13; Ro 3:20) driving me to Christ, as the refuge from God's wrath against sin, and, when spiritually understood, teaching that itself is not permanent, but must give place to Christ, whom it prefigures as its scope and end (Ro 10:4); and drawing me to Him by its promises (in the prophecies which form part of the Old Testament law) of a better righteousness, and of God's law written in the heart (De 18:15-19; Jer 31:33; Ac 10:43).<p>am dead to the law&#8212;literally, "I died to the law," and so am dead to it, that is, am passed from under its power, in respect to non-justification or condemnation (Col 2:20; Ro 6:14; 7:4, 6); just as a woman, once married and bound to a husband, ceases to be so bound to him when death interposes, and may be lawfully married to another husband. So by believing union to Christ in His death, we, being considered dead with Him, are severed from the law's past power over us (compare Ga 6:14; 1Co 7:39; Ro 6:6-11; 1Pe 2:24).<p>live unto God&#8212;(Ro 6:11; 2Co 5:15; 1Pe 4:1, 2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Through the law</span> of Christ, as some say; or rather, through the law of Moses, of which he had been before speaking: that is, say some, through the death of the law; the law itself being dead, as a covenant of works, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a></span>.

The apostle further replies to the objection against the doctrine of justification, being a licentious one, from the end of his, and other believers, being dead to the law: he owns he was dead unto it, not in such sense as not to regard it as a rule of walk and conversation, but so as not to seek for life and righteousness by it, nor to fear its accusations, charges, menaces, curses, and condemnation: he was dead to the moral law as in the hands of Moses, but not as in the hands of Christ; and he was dead to it as a covenant of works, though not as a rule of action, and to the ceremonial law, even as to the observance of it, and much more as necessary to justification and salvation: and so he became "through the law"; that is, either through the law or doctrine of Christ; for the Hebrew word  to which answers, signifies properly doctrine, and sometimes evangelical doctrine, the Gospel of Christ; see <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a> and then the sense is, that the apostle by the doctrine of grace was taught not to seek for pardon, righteousness, acceptance, life, and salvation, by the works of the law, but in Christ; by the doctrine of the Gospel, which says, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved; he became dead to the law, which says, do this and live: or through the books of the law, and the prophets, the writings of the Old Testament, which are sometimes called the law, he learnt that righteousness and forgiveness of sins were only to be expected from Christ, and not the works of the law; things, though manifested without the law, yet are witnessed to by the law and prophets: or through the law of his mind, the principle of grace formed in his soul, he became dead to the power and influence of the law of works, he being no longer under the bondage of that, but under grace, as a governing principle in his soul: or the word law, here twice used, may signify one and the same law of works; and the meaning be, either that through Christ's fulfilling the law in his room and stead, assuming an holy human nature the law required, and yielding perfect obedience to it, and submitting to the penalty of it, he became dead to it; that is, through the body of Christ, see <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a> and through what he did and suffered in his body to fulfil it; or through the use, experience, and knowledge of the law, when being convinced of sin by it, and seeing the spirituality of it, all his hopes of life were struck dead, and he entirely despaired of ever being justified by it. Now the end of his being dead unto it, delivered from it, and being directed to Christ for righteousness, was, says he, <p>that I might live unto God; not in sin, in the violation of the law, in neglect and defiance of it, or to himself, or to the lusts of men, but to the will of God revealed in his word, and to his honour and glory; whence it most clearly follows, that though believers are dead to the law, and seek to be justified by Christ alone, yet they do not continue, nor do they desire to continue in sin, or indulge themselves in a vicious course of living, but look upon themselves as under the greater obligation to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I through the law am dead to the <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> law, that I might live unto God.</span><p>(t) The Law that terrifies the conscience brings us to Christ, and he alone causes us to indeed die to the Law, because by making us righteous, he takes away from us the terror of conscience.

By the crucifixion the curse of the law was fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>); and so far Christ died <span class="ital">through the law</span>, which demanded, and in Christ’s death received, the accomplishment of its curse.

This is the only interpretation which keeps closely to the context, and is therefore to be preferred to the views of others, who understand <span class="greekheb">διὰ νόμου</span> to refer to the <span class="ital">Messianic contents</span> of the law and the prophets, by which Paul had been induced to abandon the law (Theodoret, Corn. a Lapide, Hammond, Grotius, and others; also Baumgarten-Crusius), and of others still, who find the <span class="ital">insufficiency</span> of the law for salvation expressed, as Winer (“<span class="ital">lex legem sustulit</span>; ipsa lex, cum non posset mihi salutem impertire, mei me juris fecit atque a suo imperio liberavit”), Olshausen, Matthias, and likewise Hofmann, who understands it to refer to the knowledge acquired through the law, that it was impossible to attain righteousness in the way of the law,—which righteousness, therefore, could only be attained by means of faith; comp. Hilgenfeld, Reithmayr, also Ewald, whose interpretation would seem to call for <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸν νόμον</span>.

De Wette thus explains the pedagogic thought which he supposes to be intended: “By my having thoroughly lived in the law and experienced its character in my own case, I have become conscious of the need of a higher moral life, the life in the Spirit; and through the regeneration of my inner man I have made my way from the former to the latter.” So also, in all essential points, Wieseler, although the <span class="ital">usus paedagogicus</span> of the law does not <span class="ital">produce</span> regeneration and thereby moral liberation from its yoke (which, however, <span class="greekheb">διὰ νόμου</span> must affirm), but only awakens the longing after it (<a href="/romans/7-21.htm" title="I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.">Romans 7:21</a> ff.), and prepares the ground for justification and sanctification.

The stress laid on the personal pronoun shows that Paul is here referring to the facts of his personal history. He singles out his own conversion for the sake of the crucial example which it afforded of the difficulty of reconciling the commands of Christ with the traditional law of Israel, for he was actually bearing the commission of the high priest, and carrying out the orders of the Sanhedrim when Christ met him in the way and laid His commands upon him. He had to choose between the two: and at Christ’s word he flung up his office and renounced for ever the service of the Law.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ νόμου</span>: <span class="ital">though under law</span>. The translation of these words in our versions <span class="ital">through the law</span> seems to me fatal to the sense: for the death to Law which is here recorded was not due to the instrumentality of Law, but was the immediate effect of the vision and words of Christ; and the express object of this reference to the conversion of Saul is to show how union with Christ annihilates the authority of an outward law. <span class="greekheb">διὰ νόμου</span> is really akin to <span class="greekheb">διὰ γράμματος καὶ περιτομῆς</span> in <a href="/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27</a>, and to <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀκροβυστίας</span> in <a href="/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>. In all these cases <span class="greekheb">διά</span> denotes the environment, whether of the letter, of circumcision, of uncircumcision, or of law, which was subsisting at the time. Saul was on official duty, surrounded by the circumstances and machinery of Law when Christ stayed him, and he became at once dead to the claim of Law upon him.—<span class="greekheb">νόμῳ ἀπέθανον</span>. These words give a vivid description of the spiritual revulsion produced by his conversion in the heart of Saul. Whereas, hitherto, his whole mind had been set on fulfilling the whole Law, and he had counted its obligations all in all to him, he now entirely renounced the duty of obedience to its commands and repudiated its authority. And just as death works a final change, and leaves behind an indelible effect, so did his conversion affix a permanent stamp of lifelong change on all his after years: thenceforth he served another Master, owned absolute obedience to His will, listened for His inward voice or outward revelation, and drank of His Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The absence of the article before <span class="greekheb">νόμῳ</span> is noteworthy; whereas the Law of Moses, being the one revealed Law, is always designated <span class="ital">the Law</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὁ νόμος</span>), <span class="greekheb">νόμῳ</span> denotes law in the abstract, so that this clause comprehends emancipation from all control of external law. The freedom was, of course, purely spiritual: Paul continued fully to acknowledge the duty of outward submission to all duly ordained authority, but maintained the absolute independence of his spirit and conscience from its dictates.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα Θεῷ ζήσω</span>. This clause adds the motive for this death to Law. It was a veritable death unto life: Saul had striven in vain to obtain life before God by zealous fulfilment of every commandment; he now acknowledged his utter failure, surrendered all the pride and ambition of his life, and cast himself in humble trust at the feet of Jesus to receive from Him that precious life which he had sought in vain by his most zealous efforts under the Law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. For it was through the law, through the conviction of its inability to give life, that I became dead to the law. The law demanded a perfect obedience, as a condition of justification. This none can render; and it was when I experienced its condemning power, that I fled to Christ for salvation. “When the commandment came, sin revived, and I died”, <a href="/romans/7-9.htm" title="For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.">Romans 7:9</a>. Thus it was through the law that I died to the law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">am dead to the law</span>] Better, <span class="bld">died to the law</span>. The reference is to the time when deeply convinced that he could not be justified by his own obedience, he abandoned for ever all trust in his own “righteousness, which is of the law”; that he might “win Christ and be found in Him”, and might so possess the righteousness which is of God on the condition of faith only, <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>. We observe that St Paul does not regard faith and works, Christ and the sinner, as supplementing one another. He is ‘dead to the law’, he has no more to do with it, <span class="ital">as a means of justification or ground of merit</span>, than if he were dead. The same expression occurs <a href="/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>, where the figure employed is that of the marriage tie, which is entirely dissolved by death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that I might live unto God</span>] not, that I might live in sin or carelessness. The Gospel which provides a perfect righteousness in Christ, which is <span class="ital">justification</span>, provides also a life of holiness by the Spirit, a life unto God, which is <span class="ital">sanctification</span>. These are distinct, but inseparable—nay, the latter is the end and the result of the former.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To live unto God, is to live with the eye of the soul ever turned upward, to have the affection set on things above.

And the pronoun is in a measure antithetical; as if it were: for whatever may be your feeling, mine is this, that I," etc. The conjunction "for" points back to the whole passage (vers. 15-18), which has described the position to which St. Paul had himself been brought and on which he still now, when writing to the Galatians, is standing; he here justifies that description. "Through the Law;" through the Law's own procuring, through what the Law itself did, I was broken off from all connection with the Law. From the words, "I have been crucified with Christ," in the next verse, and from what we read in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, most especially when taken in connection with the occurrences at Antioch which at any rate led to the present utterance, and with the hankering after Judaical ceremonialism in Galatia which occasioned the writing of this letter, we may with confidence draw the conclusion that St. Paul is thinking of the Law in its ceremonial aspect, that is, viewed as determining ceremonial purity and ceremonial pollution. He is here most immediately dealing with the question, whether Jewish believers could freely associate without defilement in God's sight with Gentile believers who according to the Levitical Law were unclean, and could partake of the like food with them. The notion of becoming dead to the Law through the cross of Christ has other aspects besides this, as is evinced by <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; a fact which is indeed glanced at by the apostle even here; but of the several aspects presented by this one and the same many-faced truth, the one which he here more particularly refers to is that which it bore towards the Law as a ceremonial institute. That which the Law as a ceremonial institute did in relation to Christ was this - it pronounced him as crucified to be in the intensest degree ceremonially accursed and polluting; to be most absolutely <span class="accented">cherem.</span> But Christ in his death and resurrection-life is appointed by God to be the sinner's only and complete salvation. It follows that he who by faith and sacrament is made one with Christ, does, together with the spiritual life which he draws from Christ, partake also in the pollution and accursedness which the Law fastens upon <span class="accented">him</span>; he is by the Law bidden away: he can thenceforth have no connection  with it, - the Law itself will have it so. "But (the apostle's feeling is) the Law may curse on as it will: I have life with God and in God nevertheless." This same aspect of the death of Christ as disconnecting believers from the Law viewed as a ceremonial institute, through the pollutedness which the Law attached to most especially that form of death, is referred to in <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10-13</a>. The phrase, "I died unto the Law," is similar to that of "being made dead to the Law" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>), and being "discharged [or, 'delivered'] from the Law (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)," which we have <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4, 6</a>; though the particular aspect of the fact that the cross disconnects believers from the Law is not precisely the same in the two passages, since in the Romans the Law is viewed more in its character as a rule of moral and spiritual life (see <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might live unto God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">that I might become alive unto God.</span> It is not likely that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is a future indicative, although we have <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 4, and the form <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>; for the future would most probably have been <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11, 12</a>; and <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>.

In verbs denoting a <span class="accented">state</span> of being, the aorist frequently (though not necessarily) means coming into that state, as for example, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "became poor" (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-9.htm">2 Corinthians 9:9</a>). "Living unto God" here, as in <a href="/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>, does not so much denote any form of moral <span class="accented">action</span> towards God as that spiritual state towards him out of which suitable moral action would subsequently flow. The apostle died to the Law, in order that through Christ he might come into that vital union with God in which he might both serve him and find happiness in him; this service to God and joy in God being the "fruit-bearing" in which the "life" is manifested (<a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 6</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1;)<p>Justifying the previous thought that the reerection of the law as a standard of Christian life and a means of justification is a condemnation of the faith which relies on Christ alone for righteousness.<p>I, through the law, am dead to the law (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>For am dead, render died.
