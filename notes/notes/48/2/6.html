but with all their advantages, real or assumed, I learnt nothing from them that I did not already know, and they ended by recognising the independence and validity of my mission.”<p><span class= "bld">But of these who seemed to be somewhat.</span>—Translate rather, <span class= "ital">But from those who are reputed to be somewhat.</span> The phrase corresponds to “them which are of reputation” in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>; and here, as there, it is important to keep the present tense. It is not only “those who <span class= "ital">were</span> of authority at the Council,” but “those who <span class= "ital">are</span> the great authorities with you Galatians now.” The Apostle speaks with a certain amount of irony. “From these very great authorities, these persons of such especial reputation [I got nothing].”<p><span class= "bld">Whatsoever they were.</span>—We shall, perhaps, not be wrong in keeping to the Authorised version, though some of the best commentators translate rather, <span class= "ital">What they</span> (once) <span class= "ital">were,</span> with a stress on “were,” and referring to the advantage which they possessed over St. Paul in having “known Christ after the flesh” through their early call to the Apostleship.<p><span class= "bld">God accepteth no man’s person.</span>—This phrase is a curious instance of a Greek expression framed after the analogy of the Hebrew, and yet in the process contracting a different signification, through the influence of the idiomatic use of one of the Greek expressions involved. “To accept the face” in the Old Testament is used in a good sense of “showing favour” to any one, but without any imputation of partiality. “To accept the face” (or <span class= "ital">person</span>) in the New Testament always carries with it the idea of partiality; the word for “face” being idiomatically used for “a mask,” and hence coming to mean “the outward, assumed, accidental characteristics of a man” as opposed to his real and inward character. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-25.htm" title=" But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.">Colossians 3:25</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>; <a href="/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.">James 2:9</a>; <a href="/jude/1-16.htm" title="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>.) The meaning here is that even if the elder Apostles had “seen with their eyes,” and “looked upon and handled the Word of Life” (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>), God would not regard the advantages implied in this more than any other external advantage of birth, position, natural gifts, &c.<p><span class= "bld">For they who seemed to be somewhat.</span>—The same phrase as in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a> : <span class= "ital">they who were of reputation.</span> There is here another break in the regular construction of the sentence. The Apostle begins as if he were going to finish differently: “From those who are reputed to be somewhat . . . I received nothing in the conference which I had with them;” but he suddenly changes his point of view: “From those who are reputed to be somewhat” (sentence left unfinished) “to me, I say, these reputable persons added nothing.”<p><span class= "bld">In conference added nothing.</span>—“Added in conference” is all one word in the Greek, and corresponds to “communicated” in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>. The idea of “adding” (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> imparting fresh knowledge) seems, however, to be derived rather from the context than from the form of the Greek compound, as our translators apparently supposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/galatians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:...">Galatians 2:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">But of those who seemed to be somewhat </span>— Who were most esteemed among the apostles; <span class="ital">whatsoever they were </span>— How eminent soever; <span class="ital">it maketh no matter </span>— No difference; <span class="ital">to me </span>— So that I should alter either my doctrine or my practice. <span class="ital">God accepteth no man’s person </span>— For any eminence in gifts or outward prerogatives: he does not show favour to any man on account of his birth, office, riches, or any external circumstance, <a href="/job/34-19.htm" title="How much less to him that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.">Job 34:19</a>.

This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But of those who seemed to be somewhat - See <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>. This undoubtedly refers to those who were the most eminent among the apostles at Jerusalem. There is an apparent harshness in our common translation which is unnecessary. The word used here (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  dokounto&#772;n) denotes those who were thought to be, or who were of reputation; that is, men who were of note and influence among the apostles. The object of referring to them here is, to show that he had the concurrence and approbation of the most eminent of the apostles to the course which he had pursued.<p>Whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me - Tyndale renders this, "What they were in time passed, it maketh no matter to me." The idea seems to be this. Paul means to say that whatever was their real rank and standing, it did not in the least affect his authority as an apostle, or his argument. While he rejoiced in their concurrence, and while he sought their approbation, yet he did not admit for a moment that he was inferior to them as an apostle, or dependent on them for the justness of his views What they were, or what they might be thought to be, was immaterial to his claims as an apostle, and immaterial to the authority of his own views as an apostle. He had derived his gospel from the Lord Jesus; and he had the fullest assurance that his views were just. Paul makes this remark evidently in keeping with all that he had said, that he did not regard himself as in any manner dependent on them for his authority. He did not treat them with disrespect; but he did not regard them as having a right to claim an authority over him.<p>God accepteth no man's person - See the <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a> note; <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a> note. This is a general truth, that God is not influenced in His judgment by a regard to the rank, or wealth, or external condition of anyone. Its particular meaning here is, that the authority of the apostles was not to be measured by their external rank, or by the measure of reputation which they had among men. If, therefore, it were to be admitted that he himself were not in circumstances of so much external honor as the other apostles, or that they were esteemed to be of more elevated rank than he was, still he did not admit that this gave them a claim to any higher authority. God was not influenced in His judgment by any such consideration; and Paul therefore claimed that all the apostles were in fact on a level in regard to their authority.<p>In conference - When I conferred with them, <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>. They did not then impose upon me any new obligations; they did not communicate anything to me of which I was previously ignorant. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Greek, "From those who," &c. He meant to complete the sentence with "I derived no special advantage"; but he alters it into "they &#8230; added nothing to me."<p>accepteth&#8212;so as to show any partiality; "respecteth no man's person" (Eph 6:9).<p>seemed to be somewhat&#8212;that is, not that they seemed to be what they were not, but "were reputed as persons of some consequence"; not insinuating a doubt but that they were justly so reputed.<p>in conference added&#8212;or "imparted"; the same Greek as in Ga 1:16, "I conferred not with flesh and blood." As I did not by conference impart to them aught at my conversion, so they now did not impart aught additional to me, above what I already knew. This proves to the Galatians his independence as an apostle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But of those who seemed to be somewhat:</span> the word translated <span class="ital">seemed, </span> is the same with that in <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a></span>, which we there translate <span class="ital">of reputation.</span> The apostle means the same persons that were of the greatest reputation, and so the following words, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">to be somewhat, </span> do import, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/5-36.htm" title="For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.">Acts 5:36</a> 8:9</span>. We must not understand the apostle, by this expression, to detract from the just reputation that the apostles, and these eminent Christians at Jerusalem, had; he only taketh notice here of them, as magnified by the false teachers of this church, to the lessening of himself; and as <span class="ital">those who seemed to be somewhat, </span> must be interpreted as relating to these men’s estimation of them; that seemed to you to be somewhat, though I seem nothing to you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me; </span> whatsoever they were formerly, suppose (as probably some of these Galatians had said) that they saw Christ in the flesh, were immediately called by him, when I was a Pharisee, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">God accepteth to man’s person; </span> hath no regard to what a man hath been, but to what he is. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me; </span> when I came to confer and discourse with them, about the doctrine which I and they had taught, I learned no new doctrine from them, different from what I had before taught, neither did they reprove or correct me, for any thing which I had taught amiss; we were all of the same mind. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But of these, who seemed to be somewhat,.... Not the false brethren, but the Apostles James, Cephas, and John, who were  "men of great esteem": high in the opinion of all good men; not that they were looked upon to be more than human, as Simon Magus gave out that he was "some great one", and his followers thought him to be "the great power of God"; for such an extravagant conceit of these men was never entertained; nor were they thought to be something when they were nothing, for they really were somewhat; they were ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of grace; they were the Lord's ambassadors, and the apostles of the Lamb. However, says the apostle, <p>whatsoever they were;  "formerly", some time ago, which our version does not so fully express, <p>it maketh no matter to me, God accepteth no man's person. This is said, not by way of slight or contempt, but in vindication of himself, whom the false teachers endeavoured to lessen, by giving high encomiums of the apostles at Jerusalem. It looks as if they had upbraided the apostle with being a persecutor of the church before his conversion, when nothing of such a nature could be laid to the charge of these men, and therefore he was not to be set upon a level with them: to which he may be thought to reply in such manner as this, that as for himself, it is true, he had been an injurious person to the saints; and he was ready to own it, for his own humiliation, and to illustrate the grace of God in his conversion; and as these excellent men, what they were before their conversion, it was no concern of his; though, perhaps, was he disposed to inquire into their characters then, some blemishes might be found therein, as well as in his; but it is not what he and they had been, but what they now were: he could have observed, that they were persons formerly of a very low figure in life, of mean occupations, fishermen by employment, and very illiterate persons, when he was bred a scholar at the feet of Gamaliel; but he chose not to make such observations, he knew that God was no respecter of persons, nor was he influenced by any such external circumstances, but chose whom he pleased to such an high office; and that he, who of fishermen made them apostles, of a persecutor had made him one also. Or these false teachers perhaps had objected to him, that these valuable men had been with Christ from the beginning, were eyewitnesses of his majesty, heard the doctrines of the Gospel from his lips, and saw his miracles, had had a similar conversation with him, when he was a preacher of much later date, and could not pretend to such advantages, and therefore ought not to be equalled to them: his answer is, that whatever privileges of this kind they had enjoyed, as could not be denied but they were considerable, yet this mattered not, nor did it make any great difference between him and them; he had seen Christ too, though as one born out of due time; had received an immediate commission from him to preach his Gospel, and was appointed an apostle by him as they were, without any respect of persons: and whereas it might have been urged, that these men had entertained different sentiments from him formerly, concerning the observance of the law, he signifies he had nothing to do with that, to their own master they stood, to whom they must give an account, who, without respect of persons, will render to every man according to his works: and, adds he, <p>for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me; whatever opinions they formerly gave into, in their conversation with him, when he communicated the Gospel he preached to them, they found no fault with it; they did not go about to correct it; nor did they make any addition to it; the scheme of truths he laid before them, which had been the subject of his ministry, was so complete and perfect, containing the whole counsel of God, that they had nothing to add unto it; which shows the agreement between them, that he did not receive his Gospel from them, the perfection of his ministry, and that he was not a whit behind them in knowledge and gifts. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a>.

Comp. <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a> ff.; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a> ff. An anacoluthon is also assumed by Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Piscator, Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, Estius, Morus, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Winer, Usteri, Matthies, Schott, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Hilgenfeld, and others; so that—according to the usual view (Wieseler takes the correct one)—with <span class="greekheb">ἐμοὶ γὰρ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Paul again takes up the thread of the discourse which had broken off with <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ δὲ δοκούντων εἶναί τι</span>, and merely continues it <span class="ital">actively</span> instead of <span class="ital">passively</span> (Winer, p. 529 [E. T. 711]). But this is opposed both by <span class="greekheb">ἐμοί</span>, which logically would not be in its proper place at the head of the resumed sentence, and also by <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, which does not correspond to the mere <span class="ital">inquam</span> (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>) after parentheses, but in the passages concerned (also <a href="/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>) is to be taken as explaining or assigning a reason. Hermann makes out an <span class="ital">aposiopesis</span>, so that <span class="ital">quid metuerem?</span> has to be supplied after <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἶναί τι</span>.[72] But this is not suggested by the context, nor is it permitted by the tranquil flow of the discourse, in which no such emotion as warrants an <span class="ital">aposiopesis</span> is discoverable. Fritzsche supplies the very same thing which in <a href="/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a> was to be supplied after <span class="greekheb">ψευδαδέλφους</span>, making Paul say, “<span class="ital">a viris autem</span> (nempe), qui <span class="ital">auctoritate valerent</span> [circumcisionis necessitatem sibi imponi non sivit].” But however easy and natural this supplement was in <a href="/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a> after <span class="greekheb">ψευδαδέλφους</span>, because it was suggested as a matter of course by the words immediately preceding, in the present case it appears both harsh and involved, as the whole body of ideas in <a href="/context/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:...">Galatians 2:4-5</a> intervenes and hinders the reader from going back to that supplement. And how abrupt would be the position of the following <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.! Lastly, the (erroneous) idea, that the <span class="ital">apostles</span> had demanded the circumcision of Titus, is thus violently imported into the text. Holsten’s involved construction (<span class="ital">z. Evang. d. Paul. u. Petr</span>. p. 273 f.)—according to which <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν δοκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is to be carried on to <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a> in conformity with the notion of <span class="greekheb">δεξιὰς λαμβάνειν ἀπό</span>—is shown by <span class="greekheb">ἐμοὶ γὰρ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., where the <span class="greekheb">δοκοῦντες</span> already reappear, to be an impossible solution of the anacoluthon, which even thus is not avoided. The passage is explained without supposing either supplement or anacoluthon:—1. Most simply, and without violence to the language, by Burk, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1865, p. 734 ff., making <span class="greekheb">εἶναί τι</span> belong to <span class="greekheb">οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει</span>: “That <span class="ital">on the part of those in authority</span> (by their recognition) I <span class="ital">am something</span> (namely, as respects my outward position), I reckon of no value.” But, in reality, Paul attached to his recognition by the original apostles the true and great value which it necessarily had for him in confronting his opponents; and hence he very carefully relates it in <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm" title="But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;">Galatians 2:7</a>. This interpretation therefore runs counter to the context. Comp. also, against it, Märcker in <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1866, p. 532 ff. 2. Just as little allowable is it (with Märcker) to connect <span class="greekheb">ἀπο δὲ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δοκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. with the words preceding, “<span class="ital">but certainly</span> (this enduring confirmation of Christian freedom was only possible) <span class="ital">through the authority</span> of the <span class="greekheb">δοκοῦντες εἶναί τι</span>.” But to the signification of <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span>, <span class="ital">from the side of</span>, a sense would thus be arbitrarily ascribed, which is not justified by passages such as <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm" title="From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.">Matthew 16:21</a>, and must have been expressed by some such explanatory addition as in <a href="/acts/2-22.htm" title="You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the middle of you, as you yourselves also know:">Acts 2:22</a>. It was impossible also for Paul—above all in <span class="ital">this</span> epistle—to conceive the maintenance of the truth of his Gentile gospel as conditional on the authority of the original apostles. Lastly, instead of the sentence which next follows asyndetically (<span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), we should expect an emphasized antithesis (such as <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὁποῖοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.). 3. The Greek Fathers, Castalio, Calovius, Zachariae, Bolten, Borger, and others, interpret the passage, “<span class="ital">But as regards those of repute, it is one and the same thing to me</span>,” etc., by which, however, <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> is quite in violation of language interchanged with <span class="greekheb">περί</span>. So also Rückert,[73] who at the same time wishes to preserve for <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> its due signification (“on the part of any one, it makes no difference to me; that is, what concerns him, is quite indifferent to me”), without authority, however, from any actual linguistic usage. 4. Following Homberg, Ewald understands it as if it stood <span class="greekheb">τῶν δὲ δοκούντων</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲν διαφέρω</span>, “But <span class="ital">compared with those</span> who etc., however high they once stood, <span class="ital">I am in nothing inferior</span>.” 5. Hofmann (comp. above, against Holsten) brings <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν δοκούντων εἶναί τι</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span>, <span class="ital">from the side of</span>) into regimen with <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>, and in such a manner that the three <span class="greekheb">δοκοῦντες στῦλοι εἶναι</span> in <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a> are supposed to form the subject of the period beginning with <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. in <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a>; but this mode of construction is decisively condemned by its very inherent monstrosity, with its parentheses inserted one within another; and besides this, the repetition of <span class="greekheb">οἱ δοκοῦντες</span> in <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a> would be entirely without aim and simply perplexing, if the continuation of the construction as regards <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ δ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ε</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. were still to follow, as is supposed by Hofmann. Nevertheless, Laurent, <span class="ital">neut. Stud</span>. p. 29 f., has agreed with the latter, but has at the same time arbitrarily removed from the disjointed construction <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">τοὐναντίον</span> as a marginal note of the apostle,—another makeshift, whereby <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τοὐναντίον</span>, so violently dealt with by Hofmann, finds the connection with <span class="greekheb">ἰδόντες</span>, which it evidently has (see below), dissevered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">δοκεῖν εἶναί τι</span>, which may mean either <span class="ital">to reckon oneself to be something great</span>, or <span class="ital">to be esteemed great by others</span> (so here), see Wetstein. Comp. Plat. <span class="ital">Euthyd</span>. p. 303 C, <span class="greekheb">τῶν πολλῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ τῶν σεμνῶν δὴ καὶ δοκούντων τι εἶναι οὐδὲν ὑμῖν μέλει</span>. The same persons are meant who are referred to in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a> by <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δοκοῦσι</span>. But the addition of <span class="greekheb">τι εἶναι</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. which follows, betray here a certain irritation in reference to the opponents, who would not concede to Paul an estimation equal to that given to the original apostles, as if <span class="greekheb">εἶναί τι</span> belonged <span class="ital">pre-eminently</span> to the latter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν</span>] Now come the parenthetical remarks, on account of which Paul leaves his <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν δοκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἶναί τι</span> standing alone, but which he introduces, lest the high estimation of those apostles—which in itself, according to the real (and by him undisputed) circumstances of the case, he by no means calls in question—should lead to the inference that he had needed instruction from them. Comp. the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ἐμοὶ γὰρ οἱ δοκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲν προσανέθ</span>., and the thought already floating before the apostle’s mind in the anacoluthic <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν δοκούντων εἶναί τι</span> (see above). Wieseler affirms too generally, that “Paul desired to check the <span class="ital">overvaluing</span> of the older apostles.” The real state of the case is this: Paul, with all decision, by way of countervailing that <span class="greekheb">δοκεῖν εἶναί τι</span> of those men of high standing which he does not dispute, throws into the scale his own independence of them. And the weight of this countervailing lies precisely in <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν</span>, so far as the latter belongs to <span class="greekheb">οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει</span>, and is not, as Hofmann will have it, an appendage to <span class="greekheb">τῶν δοκοῦντων εἶναί τι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span>, with a direct or indirect interrogative, is the strengthening <span class="ital">cunque</span> or <span class="ital">tandem</span> which occurs constantly in Greek authors (Kühner, <span class="ital">ad Xen. Mem</span>. i. 1), although not elsewhere in the N.T. (comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-32.htm" title="And when they sware that they could not tell where the man was whom he sought,">2Ma 14:32</a>); see also Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph</span>. II. p. 615 f. <span class="ital">Whosoever they were</span>, in whatsoever high repute they stood[74] while I was then with them, <span class="ital">it is all the same to me</span>. Rückert makes <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοι</span> mean, “whether high or low, apostles or what else;” holding that Paul speaks intentionally in an indefinite way of these men in high repute, as if he did not exactly know that they were apostles (?), in order to give the less offence in what he said. How strange this would be! for every reader knew whom he meant. And how unsuitable to his purpose! for what Paul desires to tell, is the recognition he received <span class="ital">from the apostles</span>. Many refer <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοι ποτε ἦσαν</span> back to the <span class="ital">lifetime of Jesus</span>, when those apostles had been His trusted disciples: some taking <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span> as <span class="ital">olim</span> (Vulgate, Jerome, Pelagius, Luther, Beza, and others, including Matthies, Schott, Olshausen, Hilgenfeld, Wieseler, Ewald); and others, with us, as <span class="ital">cunque</span> (“quiqui illi fuerunt, etiam si ab ipso Jesu instituti, perinde est,” Hermann; comp. Winer). But in the case of James (see on <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>) this reference would not be even historically applicable, or it would need at least to be applied to a different kind of relation (that of <span class="ital">kinship</span>); see Hilgenfeld. And besides, there is nothing at all to indicate any such retrospective reference to that remote past; the context points merely to the time of Paul’s sojourn in Jerusalem. Hence also it must not, with others still, be referred to—what was quite foreign to the apostle’s aim—the <span class="ital">pre-Christian</span> condition of the apostles, in which they had been <span class="ital">sinners</span> (Estius; comp. Augustine), or <span class="greekheb">ἰδιῶται</span> and <span class="ital">fishermen</span> (Ambrose, Thomas, Cajetanus, Cornelius a Lapide, and others), <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span> being likewise understood as <span class="ital">olim</span>.[75]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει</span>] <span class="ital">matters to me nothing</span>.

But in opposition to this view, apart from the fact that it involves a quite needless departure from the signification of the same word in <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/galatians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a>. The author here resumes the broken thread of the narrative, which he interrupted after <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a> in order to show that his conciliatory attitude at Jerusalem was not due to weakness or irresolution. He now proceeds to relate the sequel of the advances which he made at Jerusalem to the Pharisaic party. The repetition of the phrase <span class="greekheb">οἱ δοκοῦντες</span>, and the fresh transition from the plural <span class="greekheb">εἴξαμεν</span> to the singular <span class="greekheb">ἐμοί</span>, indicate the fresh shifting of the scene from Antioch back to Jerusalem. The first clause is left unfinished, for the mention of these men <span class="ital">who seemed to be anything</span> leads the author to interrupt his narrative again that he may challenge their right to be heard; he breaks, accordingly, into the disparaging comment, <span class="ital">what manner of men they had once been, maketh no matter</span>—a forcible expression of his disappointment at finding so little Christian sympathy or life where he had hoped to find so much. After this parenthesis he remoulds the form of his sentence; and <span class="greekheb">οἱ δοκοῦντες</span>, the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἦσαν</span>, becomes the subject of the verb <span class="greekheb">προσανέθεντο</span>. Instead, therefore, of concluding the sentence in its original form, and stating that <span class="ital">from those who so seemed</span> he got no response, he writes, <span class="ital">to me, I say, those who so seemed communicated nothing further</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν δοκούντων εἶναί τι</span>. These are identified with <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δοκοῦσιν</span> in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>. They are there described as men whom it was thought advisable to approach in private, here as men who were thought <span class="ital">to be anything, i.e.</span>, to have any weight in the Church. The English version <span class="ital">somewhat</span> suggests that they held high office and were in positions of dignity, perhaps Apostles; but the Greek order in that case must have been <span class="greekheb">τί εἶναι</span>, nor can that emphasis be justified in rendering the enclitic <span class="greekheb">τι</span> after <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span>. They were probably party-leaders, but the Apostle writes of them with scant respect as men who were now little better than a name.—<span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν</span> …: <span class="ital">What manner of men they had once been maketh no matter to me</span>. The margin of the Revised Version rightly renders <span class="greekheb">ὁποῖοι</span> as an indirect interrogative dependent on <span class="greekheb">διαφέρει</span>, and gives to <span class="greekheb">ποτε</span> its true sense of <span class="ital">formerly, in time past</span> (as in <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-23.htm" title="But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed.">Galatians 1:23</a>). Coupled as it is here with <span class="greekheb">ποτε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἦσαν</span> has the force of a pluperfect, and contrasts the character of these men as reported from past time with what Paul actually found them to be: he could get no brotherly help or counsel from them. Therefore he pronounces the adverse judgment upon them (<span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον</span> … <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνει</span>); for, like his Master (<a href="/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>), he regarded no man’s person, if weighed in the balance and found wanting.—<span class="greekheb">ἐμοὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">προσανέθεντο</span>.

The writer is about to introduce, which he does in the next five verses (6-10), a fresh illustration of the independent position, which in point both of doctrine and of ministerial footing he held in relation to the first apostles and to the heads of the Jerusalemite Church, and at the same time of the full recognition which in both respects these had accorded to him. The construction of this sentence, as it proceeds, is interrupted and changed. When St. Paul wrote, <span class="accented">from those who were reputed to be somewhat</span>, he would seem to have meant to add, "I received nothing fresh either in knowledge of the gospel or in authority as Christ's minister," or some-tiring to that effect; but in his indignant parenthesis asserting his independence with respect to those whom his gainsayers in Galatia would seem to have pronounced his superiors, both in knowledge and in office, he loses sight of the beginning of the sentence, and begins it afresh in another form with the words (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">for they who were of repute</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Reputed to be somewhat</span>; that is, thought highly cf. The phrase is of frequent occurrence, both in Greek and in Latin authors. It is obvious that he refers to the twelve and the leaders of the mother Church of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">of what sort they at any time were maketh no matter to me.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (of what sort) is suggested by the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (somewhat), and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (they were) by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (reputed); from those reputed to be somewhat whatever they really were. The comparison of the usage of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in other passages (<a href="/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="/james/1-24.htm">James 1:24</a>) hardly favours the specific interpretation, "how great." In respect to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>, in a classical author, as Bishop Light foot observes, we should have no hesitation in taking it as equivalent to <span class="accented">cunque.</span> But the word occurs in the New Testament in thirty-one ether places, and in not one is it <span class="accented">eunque</span>, but always the adverb of time, either "sometime," "in time past," as above, <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13, 23</a>; <a href="/john/9-13.htm">John 9:13</a>; or "any time," as <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>. The latter shade of meaning seems the more appropriate here. The <span class="accented">any time</span>, though not to be limited to, would, however, cover the time when the twelve were in personal attendance upon our Lord - a circumstance which St. Paul's detractors were no doubt wont to hold up as a mark of distinction not possessed by him. It seems best to take of <span class="accented">what sort</span> as dependent upon the following words, <span class="accented">maketh no matter to me.</span> This last clause is not exactly equivalent to "I care not," as if it were an almost supercilious waving aside of the consideration; it is rather a grave assertion of a matter of fact. Whatever were the gifts of knowledge and spiritual insight which the twelve or other heads of the Jerusalemite Church possessed, or whatever their ministerial privileges or authority, whether derived from personal intercourse with the Lord Jesus when upon earth or in any other way, Paul's knowledge of the gospel and Paul's apostolic authority were neither of them at all affected by them. Now, at the time that he is writing this Epistle, he was just the same in respect to the possession of the essential truth of the gospel and to his apostolic authority as if he had had no intercourse with the spiritual rulers of the Jewish Church. <span class="cmt_word">God accepteth no man's person</span>  (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The order of the words in the Greek throws especial emphasis upon "person:" <span class="accented">person of man God accepteth not</span>; that is, it is never on account of his person that God accepteth a man. This phrase, "accept a man's person," is of frequent occurrence in the Bible. In the New Testament it is always used in a bad sense, which in the Old is by no means the case. This difference is due, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, to the secondary sense of <span class="accented">actor's mask</span> attaching to the Greek noun, the actor on the Greek stage, as also on the Roman, being wont to wear a mask suited to the character in which he appeared; whence also <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> got to signify this character itself. The corresponding technical term among the Romans was <span class="accented">persona</span>, a word never used of the natural face, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was. This explains the adoption of this last term in its Anglicized form by our English translators in the phrase now before us. With the like metaphorical application of the idea as that which was so common among the Romans, the word "<span class="accented">per</span>son" seemed well fitted to denote the part, or certain accessories of the part, which a man plays on the stage, so to speak, of human life, in contradistinction to his more interior and essential character. The phrase denotes accepting a man, for example, for his worldly rank or position, for his office, for his nationality, even for his Church status (see <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1, 9</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-17.htm">1 Peter 1:17</a>). The special adjuncts of a man's <span class="accented">person</span> referred to in the present passage are those of the outward call aforetime to be apostles and personal attendants upon the Lord Jesus while upon earth, and, in the case of St. James the Lord's brother, personal relationship to him. And St. Paul means to intimate that <span class="accented">his</span> knowledge of Divine truth and <span class="accented">his</span> ministerial fidelity and efficiency might be as real and as great, if God's will were so, as the knowledge and ministerial fidelity and efficiency of the twelve and St. James, whom his gainsayers were honouring so far above him merely for their <span class="accented">person's</span> sake. God made no such difference between him and them, but wrought with him just as much. <span class="cmt_word">For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <span class="accented">for to me they who were of repute in conference added nothing.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, as it stands here, appears related to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 2. I laid before them my gospel; they imparted to me nothing fresh (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Thus Chrysostom and Theodoret. In <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>, where the same verb occurs (see note), there is nothing to accentuate the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as there is here. The "for" appears related to the foregoing clause. That God does not respect man for his person was evidenced by the fact that Paul's knowledge of the gospel was already so complete and his work was so honoured by God, that those whose <span class="accented">person</span> seemed to many so markedly superior to his, found that all they had to do was to frankly recognize his teaching as already adequate and complete, and his work as standing on a perfectly equal footing with their own. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Render the passage as follows: "But to be something from (at the hands of) those who were of repute, whatever they were, matters nothing to me (God accepteth not man's person), for those who were of repute imparted nothing to me."<p>To be something (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Comp. <a href="/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a>; <a href="/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>.
