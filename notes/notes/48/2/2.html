There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.">Acts 16:9</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.">Acts 23:11</a>; <a href="/acts/27-23.htm" title="For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,">Acts 27:23</a>), but also in a state of trance (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>), and through other undefined modes of intimation (<a href="/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6-7</a>; <a href="/context/acts/20-22.htm" title="And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:">Acts 20:22-23</a>). By what particular form of revelation he was guided in this instance does not appear. It would seem that this inward spiritual guidance granted privately to the Apostle coincided with a formal commission from the Church at Antioch (<a href="/acts/15-2.htm" title="When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.">Acts 15:2</a>), which, as the external and apparent side of the transaction, is naturally related by the historian, while it is just as naturally omitted by the Apostle, whose thoughts are directed rather to his own personal conduct and motives.<p><span class= "bld">Communicated unto them</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Church at Jerusalem. A distinction appears to be drawn between what the Apostle said in his public intercourse with the Church and the more detailed conference or conferences into which he entered privately with the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Which I preach.</span>—The present tense is noticeable. The gospel which the Apostle had been preaching up to the time of the Council of Jerusalem was the same as that which he still preached at the time of his writing to the Galatians. It had undergone no change in its essential features, especially in the one doctrine which he was most anxious to impress upon the Galatians—the doctrine of justification by faith.<p><span class= "bld">Privately to them which were of reputation.</span>—Better, more simply, <span class= "ital">to them of repute.</span> The present tense is again used, the Apostle hinting, not only at the position which the Judaic Apostles held at the time of the Council, but also at the way in which their authority was appealed to by the Judaising partisans in Galatia. There is a slight shade of irony in the expression. It is not so much “those which <span class= "ital">were</span> of reputation” in the gathering at Jerusalem as “those who <span class= "ital">are still</span> held to be the only authorities <span class= "ital">now.”</span><p>Who are meant by “them of repute” appears more distinctly from <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>, where James, Peter, and John are mentioned by name.<p><span class= "bld">Lest by</span> <span class= "bld">any means.</span>—The Apostle did not really want confidence in his own teaching. And yet he was aware that it rested solely upon his own individual conviction, and upon the interpretation that he had put upon the intimation to him of the divine will. There was, therefore, still a certain element of uncertainty and room for confirmation, which the Apostle desired to receive. His character hits the happy mean between confidence in his cause (self-confidence, or self-reliance, as it would be called if dealing with a lower sphere), without which no great mission can be accomplished, and opinionatedness or obstinacy. He, therefore, wished to “make assurance doubly sure,” and it is this confirmed and ratified certainty which animates his whole language in writing to the Galatians. Something of it, perhaps, is reflected back upon his account of the earlier stages in the process through which his opinions had gone, given in the last chapter.<p><span class= "bld">I should run, or had run.</span>—St. Paul here introduces his favourite metaphor from the foot-races, such as he might see in the Isthmian games at Corinth. (Comp. especially, for a similar reference to his own career, <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Philippians 2:16</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/galatians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a></span>. And <span class="ital">I went up </span>— Not by any command from the apostles, nor to receive instructions in my work from them; but <span class="ital">by revelation </span>— From God, directing me to go. The apostle does not say to whom the revelation was made: it might be made to Paul himself, or to some of the prophets then residing at Antioch. But this circumstance, that he went in consequence of a revelation, shows evidently that the occasion of the journey was of great importance. It was, therefore, as has been observed above, very probably the journey which, at the desire of the church at Antioch, Paul and Barnabas undertook for the purpose of consulting the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning the circumcision of the converted proselytes, of which we have an account Acts 15., &c., where see the notes. Some indeed have been of opinion, that the journey to Jerusalem here spoken of, was posterior to that council. But as there is no evidence that Paul and Barnabas travelled together any more after they returned to Antioch from the council, but rather evidence to the contrary,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<a href="/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39</a>,) that opinion cannot be admitted. <span class="ital">And communicated unto them </span>— To the chief of the church in Jerusalem; <span class="ital">that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles </span>— (See <a href="/acts/15-4.htm" title="And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.">Acts 15:4</a>,) namely, touching justification by faith alone; not that they might confirm me therein, but that I might preclude or remove prejudice from them. <span class="ital">But privately to them which were of reputation </span>— Or <span class="ital">to those of eminence, </span>as the original expression here evidently signifies. He did not declare the doctrine which he preached publicly at first, but spoke severally to the apostles one by one; <span class="ital">lest I should run, </span>or <span class="ital">should have run in vain </span>— That is, Lest, being suspected to preach differently from them, I should lose the fruit either of my present or past labours. For the other apostles might have greatly hindered the success of his labours, had they not been fully satisfied both of his mission and doctrine. In using the word <span class="ital">run, </span>the apostle beautifully expresses the swift progress of the gospel; and in speaking of <span class="ital">running in vain, </span>he alludes to a race, in which the person who loses the prize is said <span class="ital">to run in vain.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I went up by revelation - Not for the purpose of receiving instruction from the apostles there in regard to the nature of the Christian religion. It is to be remembered that the design for which Paul states this is, to show that he had not received the gospel from human beings. He is careful, therefore, to state that he went up by the express command of God. He did not go up to receive instructions from the apostles there in regard to his own work, or to be confirmed by them in his apostolic office, but he went to submit an important question pertaining to the church at large. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>, it is said that Paul and Barnabas went up by the appointment of the church at Antioch. But there is no discrepancy between that account and this, for though he was designated by the church there, there is no improbability in supposing that he was directed by a special revelation to comply with their request. The reason why he says that he went up by direct revelation seems to be to show that he did not seek instruction from the apostles; he did not go of his own accord to consult with them as if he were dependent upon them; but even in a case when he went to advise with them he was under the influence of express and direct revelation, proving that he was commissioned by God as much as they were.<p>And communicated unto them that gospel ... - Made them acquainted with the doctrines which he preached among the pagans. He stated fully the principles on which he acted; the nature of the gospel which he taught; and his doctrine about the exemption of the Gentiles from the obligations of the Law of Moses. He thus satisfied them in regard to his views of the gospel; and showed them that he understood the system of Christianity which had been revealed. The result was, that they had entire confidence in him, and admitted him to entire fellowship with them; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>.<p>But privately - Margin, "Severally." Greek (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  kat' idian. The phrase means that he did it not in a public manner; not before a general assembly; not even before all the apostles collected together, but in a private manner to a few of the leaders and chief persons. He made a private explanation of his motives and views, so that they might understand it before it became a matter of public discussion. The point on which Paul made this private explanation was not whether the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles, for upon that they had no doubt after the revelation to Peter <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>; but whether the rites of the Jews were to be imposed on the Gentile converts. Paul explained his views and his practice on that point, which were that he did not impose those rites on the Gentiles; that he taught that people might be justified without their observance; and that they were not necessary in order to salvation. The reasons why he sought this private interview with the leading men in Jerusalem he has not stated. But we may suppose that they were something like the following:<p>(1) The Jews in general had very strong attachment to their own customs, and this attachment was found in a high degree among those who were converted from among them to the Christian faith. They would be strongly excited, therefore, by the doctrine that those customs were not necessary to be observed.<p>(2) if the matter were submitted to a general assembly of converts from Judaism, it could not fail to produce great excitement. They could not be made readily to understand the reasons why Paul acted in this manner; there would be no possibility in an excited assemblage to offer the explanations which might be desirable; and after every explanation which could be given in this manner, they might have been unable to understand all the circumstances of the case.<p>(3) if a few of the principal men were made to understand it, Paul felt assured that their influence would be such as to prevent any great difficulty. He therefore sought an early opportunity to lay the case before them in private, and to secure their favor; and this course contributed to the happy issue of the whole affair; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. There was indeed much disputation when the question came to be submitted to "the apostles and elders" <a href="/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7</a>; many of the sect of the Pharisees in that assembly maintained that it was needful to teach the Gentiles that the Law of Moses was to be kept <a href="/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>; and no one can tell what would have been the issue of that discussion among the excitable minds of the converts from Judaism had not Paul taken the precaution, as he here says, to have submitted the case in private to those who were of "reputation." and if Peter and James had not in this manner been satisfied and had not submitted the views which they did, as recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7-21</a>, and which terminated the whole controversy.<p>We may just remark here that this fact furnishes an argument such as Paley has dwelt so much on in his Horae Paulinae - though he has not referred to this - of what he calls undesigned coincidences. The affair in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> and the course of the debate, looks very much as if Peter and James had had some conference with Paul in private, and had had an opportunity of understanding fully his views on the subject before the matter came before the "apostles and elders" in public, though no such private conference is there referred to by Luke. But on turning to the Epistle to the Galatians, we find in fact that he had on one occasion before seen the same Peter and James Gal 1:18-19; and that he had had a private interview with those "of reputation" on these very points, and particularly that James, Peter, and John had approved his course, and given to him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>. Thus understood, the case here referred to was one of the most consummate instances of prudence that occurred in the life of Paul; and from this case we may learn:<p>(1) That when a difficulty is to be settled involving great principles, and embracing a great many points, it is better to seek an opportunity of private explanation than to submit it to a general multitude or to public debate. It is not well to attempt to settle important points when the passions of a general assembly may be excited, and where prejudices are strong. It is better to do it by private explanations, when there is an opportunity coolly to ask questions and to state the facts just as they are.<p>(2) the importance of securing the countenance of influential men in a popular assembly; of having men in the assembly who would understand the whole case. It was morally certain that if such men as Peter and James were made to understand the case, there would be little difficulty in arriving at an amicable adjustment of the difficulty.<p>(3) though this passage does not refer to preaching the gospel in general, since the gospel here submitted to the men of reputation was the question referred to above, yet we may remark, that great prudence should be used in preaching; in stating truths that may excite prejudices, or when we have reason to apprehend prejudices; and that it is often best to preach the gospel to men of reputation &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  kat' idian "separately," or "privately." In this way the truth can be made to bear on the conscience; it may be better adapted to the character of the individual; he may put himself less in a state of defense, and guard himself less against the proper influences of truth. And especially is this true in conversing with persons on the subject of religion. It should be if possible alone, or privately. Almost any person may be approached on the subject of religion if it is done when he is alone; when he is at leisure, and if it is done in a kind spirit. Almost anybody will become irritated if you address him personally in a general assembly, or even with his family around him. I have never in more than in one or two instances been unkindly treated when I have addressed an individual on the subject of religion if he was alone; and though a minister should never shrink from stating the truth, and should never be afraid of man, however exalted his rank, or great his talents, or vast his wealth, yet he will probably meet with most success when he discourses privately to "them which are of reputation."<p>To them which were of reputation - Meaning here the leading men among the apostles. Tyndale renders this, "which are counted chefe." Doddridge, "those of greatest note in the church." The Greek is, literally, "those who seem," more fully in <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; "who seem to be something," that is, who are persons of note, or who are distinguished.<p>Lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain - Lest the effects of my labors and journeys should be lost. Paul feared that if he did not take this method of laying the case before them privately, they would not understand it. Others might misrepresent him, or their prejudices might be excited, and when the case came before the assembled apostles and elders, a decision might be adopted which would go to prove that he had been entirely wrong in his views, or which would lead those whom he had taught, to believe that he was, and which would greatly hinder and embarrass him in Iris future movements. In order to prevent this, therefore, and to secure a just decision, and one which would not hinder his future usefulness, he had sought this private interview, and thus his object was gained. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. by revelation&#8212;not from being absolutely dependent on the apostles at Jerusalem, but by independent divine "revelation." Quite consistent with his at the same time, being a deputy from the Church of Antioch, as Ac 15:2 states. He by this revelation was led to suggest the sending of the deputation. Compare the case of Peter being led by vision, and at the same time by Cornelius' messengers, to go to C&aelig;sarea, Ac 10:1-22.<p>I &#8230; communicated unto them&#8212;namely, "to the apostles and elders" (Ac 15:2): to the apostles in particular (Ga 2:9).<p>privately&#8212;that he and the apostles at Jerusalem might decide previously on the principles to be adopted and set forward before the public council (Ac 15:1-29). It was necessary that the Jerusalem apostles should know beforehand that the Gospel Paul preached to the Gentiles was the same as theirs, and had received divine confirmation in the results it wrought on the Gentile converts. He and Barnabas related to the multitude, not the nature of the doctrine they preached (as Paul did privately to the apostles), but only the miracles vouchsafed in proof of God's sanctioning their preaching to the Gentiles (Ac 15:12).<p>to them &#8230; of reputation&#8212;James, Cephas, and John, and probably some of the "elders"; Ga 2:6, "those who seemed to be somewhat."<p>lest, &c.&#8212;"lest I should be running, or have run, in vain"; that is, that they might see that I am not running, and have not run, in vain. Paul does not himself fear lest he be running, or had run, in vain; but lest he should, if he gave them no explanation, seem so to them. His race was the swift-running proclamation of the Gospel to the Gentiles (compare "run," Margin, for "Word &#8230; have free course," 2Th 3:1). His running would have been in vain, had circumcision been necessary, since he did not require it of his converts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I went up by revelation; revelation</span> signifieth God’s immediate declaration of his will to him, that he would have him take this journey; which is not at all contradicted by Luke, saying, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/15-2.htm" title="When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.">Acts 15:2</a>,3</span>, that their journey was determined by the Christians at Antioch.

And had Paul openly there declared the liberty of Christians from circumcision, and the ceremonial usages, he had both enraged those who as yet continued in the Jewish religion, and possibly given no small offence to those who had been educated in that religion, though they were converted to the faith of the gospel, they not fully yet understanding the liberty of Christians from that yoke. By one or both of which ways, had Paul openly at Jerusalem published the doctrine which he had publicly preached in Damascus and Arabia, and other places of the Gentiles, his labours might have been rendered useless, and he might also have been less successful in his further course of preaching it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I went up by revelation,.... He was not sent for by the apostles at Jerusalem, nor did he go of himself, nor only by the vote of the church at Antioch, but by a divine revelation; not a revelation made to the church, or by the prophets there, but by God himself to him; he had a secret impulse from the Spirit of God, and a private intimation given him, that it was the will of God he should go up at this time; which is no ways inconsistent with his being sent by the church, but served as a confirmation to him, that what they determined was right, and according to the mind of God: <p>and communicated unto them that Gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles; that self-same Gospel, which he had preached, and still continued to preach to the Gentiles; relating to free and full remission of sin by the blood of Christ, justification by his righteousness without the works of the law, and freedom from all the rituals and bondage of the Mosaic dispensation: for as the Gospel he preached was all of a piece, uniform and consistent, so he did not preach one sort of doctrine to the Gentiles, and another to the Jews; but the very self-same truths which were the subject of his ministry in the Gentile world, which were a crucified Christ, and salvation alone by him, these he communicated, laid before, and exposed unto the consideration of the elders and apostles at Jerusalem; not with a view either to give or receive instructions, but to compare their sentiments and principles together; that so it might appear that there, was an entire harmony and agreement between them; and this he did not publicly, to the whole church, at least at first, and especially the article of Christian liberty, which respects the freedom of the believing Jews, from the yoke of the law; for as yet they were not able to bear this doctrine; they could pretty readily agree that the Gentiles were not obliged to it, but could not think themselves free from it; wherefore the apostle, in great prudence, did not avouch this in the public audience: <p>but privately to them which were of reputation; or "who seemed to be", i.e. somewhat, very considerable persons; not in their own opinion, or appearance only, but in reality, they seemed to be, and were pillars in the house of God; particularly he means James, Cephas, and John, then in great esteem with the saints, and deservedly honoured and respected by them, they being faithful labourers in the word and doctrine; so the Jewish doctors (a) call men of great esteem,  who "seem to be", or "are accounted of", a word to which the phrase here used answers: these were spiritual men, capable of judging of all spiritual things; men of full age, whose senses were exercised to discern between truth and error; and were very proper persons for the apostle to lay the scheme of his ministry before, and the various truths he insisted on in it: these he met "privately", or "separately", and "singly", as it may be rendered; he either conversed with the apostles alone, and all together, in some private house; or separately, one by one, in their own houses, and there freely and familiarly discoursed with them about the several doctrines of the Gospel; and particularly this, of freedom from the law: his end in it was, as he says, <p>lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain: which is said, not with regard to himself, as if he had entertained any doubt of the doctrines he had preached, and needed any confirmation in them from them; for he was fully assured of the truth of them, and assured others of the same; or that he questioned the agreement of the apostles with him; or that his faith at all depended on their authority; but with regard to others, and his usefulness among them. The false teachers had insinuated that his doctrine was different from that of the apostles in Jerusalem, and so endeavoured to pervert the Gospel he preached, and overthrow the faith of those that heard him; and could this have been made to appear, it would in all likelihood have rendered, in a great measure, his past labours in vain, and have prevented his future usefulness: some read these words as an interrogation, "do I in any manner run, or have I run in vain?" no; from the account he laid before the church, the elders, and apostles, both in private and in public, <a href="/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4</a> it clearly appeared what success attended his ministry, how many seals he had of it, what numbers of souls were converted under it, and how many churches were planted by his means; for by "running" here is not meant the Christian course he ran, in common with other believers, which lies in the exercise of grace, and the discharge of duty; but the course of his ministry, which he performed with great activity, application, diligence, and constancy, until he had finished it. <p>(a) Vid.

Luke narrates the outward cause, Paul the inward motive of the concurrent divine suggestion, which led to this his journey; the two accounts together give us its historical connection <span class="ital">completely</span>. Comp. Acts 10, in which also a revelation and the messengers of Cornelius combine in determining Peter to go to Caesarea. The state of the case would have to be conceived as similar, even if our journey were considered identical with that related Acts 11, 12., in which case <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν</span> would apply not—possibly—to the prophesying of Agabus, but likewise to a divine revelation imparted <span class="ital">to Paul himself</span>. Hermann (<span class="ital">de P. ep. ad Gal. trib. prim. capp.</span> Lips. 1832, also in his <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. V. p. 118 ff.), as before him Schrader, and after him Dav.

Wesseling, <span class="ital">ad Herod</span>. ii. 151; Matthiae, p. 1359; Winer, p. 376 [E. T. 502]. But, on the one hand, the account of Acts as to the occasion of our journey does not at all require any explaining away of the revelation (see above); and, on the other hand, it would by no means be necessary, as Hermann considers that on our interpretation it would, that <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τινα ἀποκάλυψιν</span> should have been written, since Paul’s object is not to indicate some sort of revelation which was not to be more precisely defined by him, but to express the <span class="ital">qualifying</span> circumstance that he had gone up not of his own impulse, but at the divine command, not <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἑαυτοῦ</span>, but <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν</span>, <span class="ital">conformably to revelation</span>. Moreover, it is the only meaning consonant with the aim of the apostle, who from the beginning of the epistle has constantly in view his apostolic dignity, that here also, as in <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλ</span>. should express <span class="ital">a divine revelation</span> (comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>), as in fact the word is constantly used in the N.T. in this higher sense: comp. <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀνεθέμην</span>] <span class="ital">I laid before them</span>, for cognisance and examination.

Moreover, the designation of the three apostles as <span class="greekheb">οἱ δοκοῦντες</span> is not “an ironical side-glance” (Schwegler, I. p. 120), nor has it proceeded from the irritation of a bitter feeling against those who had habitually applied this expression to these apostles (Cameron, Rückert, Schott, comp. Olshausen); but it is used in a purely historical sense: for an ironical designation at this point, when Paul is about to relate his <span class="ital">recognition</span> on the part of the earlier apostles, would be utterly devoid of tact, and would not be at all consonant either to the <span class="ital">point of view of a colleague</span>, which he constantly maintains in respect to the other apostles, or to the <span class="ital">humility</span> with which he regards this collegiate relation (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1 Corinthians 15:8</a> ff.). He has, however, <span class="ital">purposely chosen</span> this expression (“<span class="ital">the authorities</span>”), because the very matter at stake was his <span class="ital">recognition</span>. Homberg, Paulus, and Matthies wrongly assert that <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δοκοῦσι</span> means <span class="ital">putantibus</span>, and that the sequel belongs to it, “<span class="ital">qui putabant, num forte in vanum currerem</span>.” <a href="/context/galatians/2-5.htm" title="To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you....">Galatians 2:5-6</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a> testify against this interpretation; and the introduction of <span class="greekheb">φοβεῖσθαι</span> into the notion of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΟΚΕῖΝ</span></span></span> is arbitrary, and cannot be supported by such passages as Hom. <span class="ital">Il</span>. x. 97, 101 (see, on the contrary, Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. II. p. 138 f.). Besides, it would have been inconsistent with apostolic dignity to give such a private account to those who were suspicious. In classical authors also <span class="greekheb">οἱ δοκοῦντες</span>, without anything added to define it, means <span class="ital">those of repute, who are much esteemed, nobiles</span>. See Eur. <span class="ital">Hec</span>. 295, and thereon Schaefer and Pflugk; Porphyr. <span class="ital">de abstin</span>. ii. 40, <span class="ital">et al.;</span> Kypke, II. p. 274; Dissen, <span class="ital">ad Pind.

Chrysostom), that he was labouring or had laboured in vain; but how easy it is to understand that, for this purpose, he had to address to the apostles a more thorough and comprehensive statement, and to bring forward proofs, experiences, explanations, deeper dialectic deductions, etc.,[55] which would have been unsuitable for the general body of Christians, among whom nothing but the simple and popular exposition was appropriate! Therefore Paul dealt with his colleagues <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤʼ ἸΔΊΑΝ</span></span></span>. But we must not draw a distinction as to <span class="ital">matter</span> between the public and the private discussion, as Estius and others have done: “publice ita contulit, ut ostenderet gentes non debere circumcidi et servare legem Mosis … privato autem et secreto colloquio cum apostolis habito placuit ipsos quoque Judaeos ab observantia Mosaicae legis … esse liberandos,” etc. In this way Paul would have set forth only the <span class="ital">half</span> of <span class="ital">his</span> gospel to the mass of the Christians there; and yet this half-measure, otherwise so opposed to his character, would not have satisfied the Jewish-Christian exclusiveness. Thiersch also (<span class="ital">Kirche im apost. Zeitalt</span>. p. 128) wrongly holds (comp. Lange, <span class="ital">apost. Zeitalt</span>. p. 100) that the subject of the private discussion was Paul’s <span class="ital">apostolic dignity;</span> it was nothing else than <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. and only <span class="ital">in so far</span> his apostolic legitimacy. The <span class="ital">object</span> of the private discussion was, in Winer’s opinion: “ut ne, si his (the <span class="greekheb">δοκοῦσι</span>) videretur P. castigandus, publica expostulatione ipsius auctoritas infringeretur.” But this also is not in accordance with the decided character of Paul; and if he had dreaded a <span class="ital">public expostulation</span>, he would not have ventured first to set forth his gospel <span class="ital">publicly</span>, because the apostles, in the event of disapproval, would not have been able to withhold <span class="ital">public</span> contradiction. The view that the private discussion with the <span class="greekheb">δοκοῦσι</span> <span class="ital">preceded</span> the general discussion with the church (so Neander, p. 277; Lekebusch, <span class="ital">Apostelgesch</span>. p. 295), runs counter to the account of our passage, which represents the course of events as the converse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μήπως εἰς κενὸν τρέχω ἢ ἔδραμον</span>] Taken by itself, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΉΠΩς</span></span></span> may signify either <span class="ital">lest possibly, ne forte</span>, and thus express directly the <span class="ital">design</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἀνεθέμην</span> (so, following the Vulgate and the Greek Fathers, Erasmus, Luther, and most expositors, including Winer, Fritzsche, Rückert, Schott), or <span class="ital">whether … not possibly, num forte</span> (Usteri, Hilgenfeld, Hofmann, Wieseler), thus indirectly <span class="ital">interrogative</span>. The former interpretation is decidedly to be rejected, because the indicative aorist <span class="greekheb">ἔδραμον</span> does not suit it; for, according to the Greek use of the particles of design with the indicative aorist or imperfect (see on <a href="/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>), the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΕΘΈΜΗΝ</span></span></span> would not actually have taken place; and besides this, we should have to assume—without any ground for doing so in the context—that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΈΧΩ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΔΡΑΜΟΝ</span></span></span> are said <span class="ital">ex aliorum judicio</span>,[56] and that <span class="greekheb">τρέχω</span> is subjunctive, although by its connection with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΔΡΑΜΟΝ</span></span></span> it evidently proclaims itself indicative. Hence <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΉΠΩς</span></span></span> must be rendered <span class="ital">Numbers forte</span>, and the reference of the <span class="ital">num</span> is supplied by the idea, “for consideration, for examination,” included in <span class="greekheb">ἀνεθέμην</span> (Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. II. pp. 137, 140). The passage is therefore to be explained: “<span class="ital">I laid before them my gospel to the Gentiles, with a view to their instituting an investigation of the question whether I am not possibly running or have run in vain</span>.” The apostle <span class="ital">himself, on his own part</span>, was in no uncertainty about this question, for he had obtained his gospel from revelation, and had already such rich experience to support him, that he certainly did not fear the downfall of his previous ministry (Holsten[57]); hence <span class="greekheb">μήπως</span> is by no means to be understood, with Usteri and Hilgenfeld, also Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gr</span>. p. 303, and Holsten, as implying any uncertainty or apprehension of his own (<span class="ital">in order to see</span>, in order to be certain, <span class="ital">whether</span>).

This statement of Paul’s motive is in no way inconsistent with the independent statement in the Acts that he was deputed by the Church. The revelation may have come to Paul himself, and in that case he prompted the decision of the Church, of which he and Barnabas were at that time the ruling spirits; or it may have been made through the Spirit to the Church, in which case Paul would count it right at once to obey his voice.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνεθέμην</span> … Two different methods of action are here specified, public addresses describing the nature and result of the Apostle’s preaching among the Greeks, and private interviews with individual brethren or groups of brethren. The term <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἰδίαν</span> does not imply secrecy in these communications. The context shows that the point at issue was the circumcision of Gentile converts.—<span class="greekheb">τοῖς δοκοῦσιν</span>. As this phrase recurs four times in eight verses, it is necessary to determine its true meaning with some precision. <span class="greekheb">δοκεῖν</span> nowhere else conveys the idea of superiority implied in our versions, <span class="ital">of reputation</span> (<span class="ital">of repute</span> R.V.). The two passages adduced in its support do not stand the test of criticism: in Eur., <span class="ital">Heracl.</span>, 897 there is an obvious ellipsis of <span class="greekheb">εὐτυχεῖν</span>, in <span class="ital">Hec.</span>, 295 of <span class="greekheb">δόξαν ἔχειν</span>. In the latter indeed <span class="greekheb">δοκούντων</span> appears to be a cynical comment of the deposed queen on the unreality of outward glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In fact <span class="greekheb">δοκεῖν</span>, like <span class="ital">seem</span> in English, was either a neutral term which expressed according to the context any impression, good or bad, produced by the appearance of an object, or it laid stress on the unreality of the mere outward semblance. The Greeks dwelt often on the contrast between <span class="greekheb">δοκεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span> embodied in the famous line of Æschylus <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ δοκεῖν δίκαιος ἀλλʼ εἶναι θέλει</span>.

I take it to mean <span class="greekheb">ἀνεθέμην οἷς ἐδόκει δεῖν ἀναθέσθαι</span>. Paul, as he states, brought the matter in private interviews before those whom it seemed right to approach in that way, <span class="ital">sc.</span>, influential opponents, whose hostility he was anxious to deprecate.—<span class="greekheb">μή πως</span> … It was of vital moment to the welfare of the Greek Churches at that time to avoid a breach with Jerusalem. Besides embracing a minority of Jewish Christians, they were leavened through and through with Jewish influences, so that a quarrel might have led to a disastrous schism in all the existing Churches. More than this, they relied still mainly on the Old Testament for the basis of their theology and morals. The abundant promise of harvest among the Greeks rested still on the nucleus of devout Gentiles who had been prepared by the teaching of the synagogue for the lessons of Christ’s Apostles. <span class="greekheb">τρέχω</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἔδραμον</span>. The present subjunctive is coupled here with the aorist indicative, as it is in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>, to express the fear of present failure, coupled with a dread that past labours had been rendered futile.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">by revelation</span>] In the Acts no mention is made of this divine intimation.

The account of this visit is not contradictory to, or even inconsistent with St Luke’s narrative in Acts 15. They supplement one another. “The account of the Acts is fuller; that of the Galatians only brings out the chief points. Luke, in keeping with the documentary character of the Acts, gives us the <span class="ital">public</span> transactions of the Council at Jerusalem; Paul taking a knowledge of these for granted, shortly alludes to his <span class="ital">private</span> conference and agreement with the Apostles.

If at the first synod of the Church, it should appear that St Paul was preaching a different Gospel among the Gentiles from that which was taught by the Apostles in Judæa, the result could not fail to be distrust of the former (so prone are men to test truth by the numbers and position of its advocates), and thus the success of his labours would be impaired.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Most commentators suppose the Apostle to fear lest his work for the future should be hindered, and that in the past undone. The construction of the original is peculiar and difficult. The particle rendered ‘or’, may mean ‘than’ or ‘more than’. And so the sense would be, ‘Lest I should run less successfully than heretofore’. The metaphor of a ‘race’ as descriptive of a <span class="ital">course</span> of life or of labour is a familiar one with St Paul. <a href="/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2 Timothy 4:7</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/galatians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κατὰ ἀποκάλυψιν</span>, <span class="ital">by revelation</span>) As Paul had revelations he had no need to learn from men.

Revelations were frequently made to the apostle, both to communicate important truths (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>) and to direct or encourage his proceedings. They appear to have been made in different ways: as, through dreams or visions (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18-21</a>; <a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>); through prophets (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; <a href="/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>); often, no doubt, through a strong impulse borne in upon his spirit, prompting him to, or debarring him from, some particular line of conduct (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6, 7</a>). The journey now in question being that recorded by St. Luke (<a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, <span class="accented">init.</span>), we have to observe that St. Luke ascribes his going to a decision come to by the brethren at Antioch (<a href="/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>). But there is no discrepancy here. It is an obvious supposition, that the apostle, taking into consideration, perhaps, the prejudice entertained against him at Jerusalem, not only, as Christ had himself intimated to him, by the unbelieving Jews (<a href="/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>), but, as James later on confessed, by even the members of the Church itself (<a href="/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>; comp. on both points, Romans 16:31), felt at first some hesitation in accepting the commission; was he by going likely to forward their views? - but that his hesitation was overruled by Christ himself, who in some way revealed to him that it was his will that he should go. Similarly, when visiting Jerusalem for the first time after his conversion, his hasty departure from the city is attributed by St. Luke to the care of the disciples for his safety (<a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>); whereas St. Paul, in his speech from the stairs, ascribes it to a" trance," in which the Lord appearing to him bade him to depart thence without delay (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17, 21</a>) The two accounts in each instance are mutually supplementary, the one viewing the case historically from the outside, the other as an autobiographical reminiscence from within. The apostle's reason for thus pointedly mentioning the especial direction under which he took this journey, had evidently reference to its being the design of Christ, that thereby, together with other objects to be subserved by it, the doctrine and ministerial work of Paul should be sealed with the recognition of his first apostles and of his earliest Church - a result of prime necessity for the prosperous development of the whole Church; more important, perhaps, than even its more ostensible result as described by St. Luke. <span class="cmt_word">And communicated unto them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and I laid before them.</span> The verb occurs in the New Testament besides only in <a href="/acts/25-14.htm">Acts 25:14</a>, where it means simply giving the king an account of Paul's case with the view apparently of getting his opinion upon it. In the present case St. Paul stated his doctrine to the persons referred to, with the view likewise of seeing what they would say; but certainly not with any intention of having it modified by their suggestions (cf. the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in 2 Macc. 3:9, which presents a curiously similar conjunction of particulars).

The present tense of the verb points to the whole period of his ministry up to the time at which he was writing. It is implied that his teaching had been the same all along. Elsewhere he styles it "my gospel" (<a href="/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Among the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); alluding to the complexion of his doctrine as bearing upon the acceptance of Gentiles before God simply upon their faith in Christ (cf. <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But privately</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, occurs sixteen times besides in the New Testament, always in the sense of <span class="accented">privately</span>, <span class="accented">apart</span> (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>; <a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31, 32</a>; <a href="/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them which were of reputation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">them who were of repute</span>; men eminent in repute and position.

There is no reason to suppose that there is any tone of disparagement in the phrase, as if the persons spoken of "<span class="accented">seemed"</span> to be more than they really were.  The apostle repeats this participle thrice in the following context - once (ver. 6), as here, absolutely; and twice (vers. 6, 9) with an infinitive. This harping upon <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a surmise that St. Paul's gainsayers in Galatia had been fond of using the expression to designate the persons referred to in disparagement of himself as a man comparatively of no mark. Compare the almost mocking reiteration of "superlatively chief apostles," in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a> and 12. l 1, referring to "pseudo-apostles." In order to determine who were the persons the apostle thus distinguishes, we naturally refer to St. Luke's account of the circumstances. St. Luke, then, seems to speak of three several meetings held on this occasion. The first (in ver. 4) when Paul and Barnabas with their fellow-deputies, were "received by the Church and the apostles and the elders;" when "they [Paul and Barnabas] declared what great things God had done in co-operation with them." It cannot have been then that St. Paul gave this exposition of his gospel. But certain of the Pharisees who had joined the Church began loudly to insist upon the necessity of Gentile converts being circumcised and conforming to the Law. Whether it was at this first meeting itself that this took place, or subsequently, at all events "the apostles and the elders" judged it to be undesirable that the matter should be further discussed in so large an assemblage of the circumcision, before, in the calmer atmosphere of a private conference, they had themselves considered what course it would be best to adopt. Accordingly, St. Luke tells us (ver. 6), "the apostles and the elders came together to see about this matter." "After much discussion had taken place," which upon a question so closely touching the Jew's national sensibilities must even in this more select body have been fraught with no ordinary excitement, the rising passions of controversy were stilled by Peter; he recalled the story of Cornelius, and founding thereupon, he warned his hearers, that by imposing, as many perhaps even of those then present were wishful to do, the intolerable yoke of Mosaism upon the neck of the Gentile disciples, they ran the risk of contravening and provoking God; for after all (he significantly reminded them), their own hope of salvation, as well as the hope of Gentile believers, was that they would be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus. Thereupon the "whole company" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in ver. 12, is used by St. Luke in the same way as in his Gospel (<a href="/luke/23-1.htm">Luke 23:1</a>) when speaking of the Sanhedrin; the eldership of the very large Church of Jerusalem must of itself, without the doubtful addition of elders from Judaean towns, have formed a considerable body) listened with hushed and respectful attention to Paul and Barnabas, while they gave a detailed account of what great signs and wonders God had wrought amongst the Gentiles through them. After this, upon James's proposition, "the apostles and the elders" came to the resolution that, in conjunction with the whole Church, they would choose and depute certain members of their community to convey to the Gentile brethren a certain letter, which very probably (cf. as to diction, vers. 17, 23, with <a href="/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>) James himself, as presiding in their meeting, with the concurrence of the apostles and the elders, drew up. The words," with the whole Church," coming in here for the first time since ver. 4, indicate a third meeting, in which the general body of believers was prevailed upon to concur in the measures before agreed upon in the second more private meeting. According to the more approved reading of ver. 23 (omitting the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>), the letter issues from "the apostles and the elder brethren" alone, as these also were the persons with whom (ver. 2) the deputation from Antioch had been sent to confer. Now, upon the review of all the circumstances as now stated, the second of these three meetings would seem to have presented just such an opportunity as would suit the design which St. Paul had frowned, of expounding his teaching to the leading spirits in Jerusalem. When he and Barnabas were relating those signs and wonders by which the seal of Divine sanction had been put upon their ministry among the Gentiles, it was natural that Paul, here no doubt, as generally "the chief speaker," should tell their hearers with the utmost distinctness what that teaching was which Heaven had thus ratified; most especially that part of it which was so directly relevant to the practical question which was then in debate, and which is so emphatically set forth in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans - to wit, that all who believe in Christ are justified and have full peace and sonship with God without any works of Mosaical ceremonialism. This was precisely "the gospel" which here (ver. 2) he speaks of as "preached by him among the Gentiles" "The apostles and the elders" answer perfectly to the description of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>.

These last are to be conceived of rather as representative of those larger bodies of men recited in the former three references - "James" representing the elders (for the present writer makes no question but that this James "the Lord's brother" was the presiding officer or Bishop of the  Church of Jerusalem, and not one of the twelve apostles), and "Cephas and John" representing the twelve, who may be believed to have been all of them at Jerusalem at this time, though these two, certainly the leading ones, are the only ones whose names there happened to be occasion for specifying. <span class="cmt_word">Lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

The present tense, <span class="accented">lest I should be running</span>, points to the time of which he is writing and the time onward therefrom. In classical Greek it would have been <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, "run," "rush on," a favourite word with the apostle, well characterizes the zealous forward, speeding manner of his activity. "In vain;" to an empty result; for no good. He intimates that there had been a danger lest the fruits of his earnest work among the Gentiles, might through some cause get wrecked. That this is what he means is clear from <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a> just cited; and not that there had been any fear lest he might himself have been somehow mistaking his way; most especially, not lest he had been at all mistaken in the doctrine which he taught, a thing which he does not for one moment imagine. His work <span class="accented">would</span> have been in danger of being spoilt if the Gentile Churches as planted by himself had been disowned or discountenanced by the mother Church, or if they had got split up into factious parties by the intervention, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of persons coming "from James," telling them that they were not in a state of salvation. To guard against this danger, he was led by Christ himself to seek a formal recognition of his doctrine by the apostles and the elders of the Jerusalemite Church, and through them by that Church itself. As the rank-and-file of the Jewish believers at Jerusalem were even bigotedly attached to the Mosaic Law, and also regarded St. Paul himself with great suspicion, he might very easily have failed of gaining the recognition he required, if he had at once brought the matter before the general body. If their spiritual leaders had not first come forward in the cause of truth, it was but too probable that some fanatical Mosaists would have gained the ear of the multitude, and hurried them away in a course of headlong opposition to Paul and his teaching, from which it might have been very difficult afterwards to recall them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By revelation (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>It was specially and divinely revealed to me that I should go.

Men of recognized position, James, Cephas, John. Not his adversaries who were adherents of these three. It is not to be supposed that he would submit his gospel to such. The expression is therefore not used ironically. Paul recognizes the honorable position of the three and their rightful claim to respect. The repetition of the phrase (<a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>, <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>) may point to a favorite expression of his opponents in commending these leaders to Paul as models for his preaching; hardly (as Lightfoot) to the contrast between the estimation in which they were held and the actual services which they rendered to him. He chooses this expression because the matter at stake was his recognition by the earlier apostles, and any ironical designation would be out of place.<p>Lest by any means I should run or had run in vain<p>Better, should be running. Comp. <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>. This is sometimes explained as implying a misgiving on Paul's part as to the soundness of his own teaching, which he desired to have set at rest by the decision of the principal apostles. On this explanation &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; will be rendered lest in some way or other. But such a misgiving is contrary to Paul's habitual attitude of settled conviction respecting that gospel which he had received by revelation, and in the preaching of which he had been confirmed by experience. In consulting the Christians at Jerusalem Paul had principally in view the formal indorsement of his work by the church and its leaders. Their formal declaration that he had not been running in vain would materially aid him in his mission. &#x39c;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; is therefore to be taken as marking an indirect question, whether - not possibly; and the sense of the whole passage is as follows: "I laid before them that gospel which I preach to the Gentiles, that they might examine and settle for themselves the question whether I am not possibly running or had run in vain." The investigation was to be for their satisfaction, not for Paul's. Run (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) is a favorite metaphor with Paul.
