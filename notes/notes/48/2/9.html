The way in which St. Paul speaks respectively of St. Peter and St. James is in strict accordance with the historical situation. When he is speaking of the general work of the Church (as in the last two verses) St. Peter is mentioned prominently; when the reference is to a public act of the Church of Jerusalem the precedence is given to St. James.<p><span class= "bld">Who seemed to be pillars.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">who are held</span> (same word as <span class= "ital">reputed</span> above) <span class= "ital">to be pillars.</span> The metaphor is a natural one, and is found not unfrequently in classical writers.

Paul they acknowledged to be an apostle of equal authority with themselves; and Barnabas they acknowledged to be a minister sent forth by the Holy Ghost to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. This distinction it is necessary to make, because it doth not appear that Barnabas was an apostle, in the proper sense of the word. The candour which the apostles at Jerusalem showed on this occasion, in acknowledging Paul as a brother apostle, is remarkable, and deserves the imitation of all the ministers of the gospel in their behaviour toward one another.” <span class="ital">And they </span>— With those that were in union with them; chiefly <span class="ital">to the circumcision </span>— The Jews. “In pursuance of this agreement, the three apostles abode, for the most part, in Judea, till Jerusalem was destroyed. After which, Peter, as tradition informs us, went to Babylon, and other parts in the East, and John into the Lesser Asia, where he was confined some years in Patmos, for the testimony of Jesus, <a href="/revelation/1-9.htm" title="I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.">Revelation 1:9</a>. But James was put to death at Jerusalem, in a popular tumult, before that city was destroyed.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Only </span>desiring <span class="ital">that we would remember the poor </span>Christians in Judea — So as to make collections for them as we proceeded in our progress through the churches of the Gentiles; <span class="ital">the same which I also was forward to do </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ο και εσπουδασα αυτο τουτο ποιησαι</span>, <span class="ital">which very thing I was eager, </span>or <span class="ital">in haste to do. </span>It is probable, that in so readily acceding to the proposal made by the apostles at Jerusalem, to collect money for the destitute saints in Judea, St. Paul was influenced by a more generous principle than that of merely relieving the necessities of the poor. For as the Jewish believers were extremely unwilling to associate with the converted Gentiles, Paul might hope that the kindness, which he doubted not the Gentiles would show in relieving their Jewish brethren, would have a happy influence in uniting the two into one harmonious body or church.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars - That is, pillars or supports in the church. The word rendered "pillars" (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  stuloi) means properly firm support; then persons of influence and authority, as in a church, or that support a church as a pillar or column does an edifice. In regard to James, see the note at <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>; compare <a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>. Cephas or Peter was the most aged of the apostles, and regarded as at the head of the apostolical college. John was the beloved disciple, and his influence in the church must of necessity have been great. Paul felt that if he had the countenance of these men, it would be an important proof to the churches of Galatia that he had a right to regard himself as an apostle. Their countenance was expressed in the most full and decisive manner.<p>Perceived the grace that was given unto me - That is, the favor that had been shown to me by the great Head of the church, in so abundantly blessing my labors among the Gentiles.<p>They gave unto me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship - The right-hand in token of fellowship or favor. They thus publicly acknowledged us as fellow-laborers, and expressed the utmost confidence in us. To give the right-hand with us is a token of friendly salutation, and it seems that it was a mode of salutation not unknown in the times of the apostles. They were thus recognised as associated with the apostles in the great work of spreading the gospel around the world. Whether this was done in a public manner is not certainly known; but it was probably in the presence of the church, or possibly at the close of the council referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.<p>That we should go unto the heathen - To preach the gospel, and to establish churches. In this way the whole matter was settled, and settled as Paul desired it to be. A delightful harmony was produced between Paul and the apostles at Jerusalem; and the result showed the wisdom of the course which he had adopted. There had been no harsh contention or strife. No jealousies had been suffered to arise. Paul had sought an opportunity of a full statement of his views to them in private <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>, and they had been entirely satisfied that God had called him and Barnabas to the work of making known the gospel among the pagan. Instead of being jealous at their success, they had rejoiced in it; and instead of throwing any obstacle in their way, they cordially gave them the right hand. How easy would it be always to prevent jealousies and strifes in the same way! If there was, on the one hand, the same readiness for a full and frank explanation; and if, on the other, the same freedom from envy at remarkable success, how many strifes that have disgraced the church might have been avoided! The true way to avoid strife is just that which is here proposed. Let there be on both sides perfect frankness; let there be a willingness to explain and state things just as they are; and let there be a disposition to rejoice in the talents, and zeal, and success of others, even though it should far outstrip our own, and contention in the church would cease, and every devoted and successful minister of the gospel would receive the right-hand of fellowship from all - however venerable by age or authority - who love the cause of true religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. James&#8212;placed first in the oldest manuscripts, even before Peter, as being bishop of Jerusalem, and so presiding at the council (Ac 15:1-29). He was called "the Just," from his strict adherence to the law, and so was especially popular among the Jewish party though he did not fall into their extremes; whereas Peter was somewhat estranged from them through his intercourse with the Gentile Christians. To each apostle was assigned the sphere best suited to his temperament: to James, who was tenacious of the law, the Jerusalem Jews; to Peter, who had opened the door to the Gentiles but who was Judaically disposed, the Jews of the dispersion; to Paul, who, by the miraculous and overwhelming suddenness of his conversion, had the whole current of his early Jewish prejudices turned into an utterly opposite direction, the Gentiles. Not separately and individually, but collectively the apostles together represented Christ, the One Head, in the apostleship. The twelve foundation-stones of various colors are joined together to the one great foundation-stone on which they rest (1Co 3:11; Re 21:14, 19, 20). John had got an intimation in Jesus' lifetime of the admission of the Gentiles (Joh 12:20-24).<p>seemed&#8212;that is, were reputed to be (see on [2338]Ga 2:2 and [2339]Ga 2:6) pillars, that is, weighty supporters of the Church (compare Pr 9:1; Re 3:12).<p>perceived the grace &#8230; given unto me&#8212;(2Pe 3:15).<p>gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship&#8212;recognizing me as a colleague in the apostleship, and that the Gospel I preached by special revelation to the Gentiles was the same as theirs.

These are the persons all along designed, though not till now named. James was the brother of our Lord, the son of Alphaeus, who wrote the epistle that goes by his name, made that famous speech in the synod at Jerusalem, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>, presided in that church, was a man of great holiness, and much esteemed of by the saints, and had a good report of them that were without. Cephas is Simon Peter. This name was given him by Christ, <a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a> and in the Syriac language signifies a "stone", as Peter does in the Greek, to which our Lord alludes, <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>. John was the evangelist, and the same that wrote the epistles, was the beloved disciple, and who outlived all the rest: <p>who seemed to be pillars; not as the Arabic version, "who thought themselves such", but were esteemed so by others, and very rightly. They were pillars among the apostles of the highest note and greatest eminence among them; they were the very chief of the apostles; for though they were all in the same office, and had the same commission, and were employed in the same work, yet there were some who made a greater figure than others, as these did, and are therefore called pillars; they were more conspicuous, and to be observed, and taken notice of, than the rest; they were pillars in the church, set in the highest place there, and the ornaments of it; see <a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>. They are called so for their constancy and stability in preaching the Gospel, and suffering for the sake of Christ; they were steadfast and immoveable in his work, nor could they be shaken or deterred from it by the menaces, reproaches, and persecutions of men; and they were the means of supporting others that were feeble minded, and of defending and maintaining the truths of the Gospel; and were set, as Jeremiah was, as a defenced city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against all the enemies of Christ, and his Gospel; and were, as the church is said to be, "the pillar and ground of truth". The apostle may have respect to the titles of this kind which were bestowed on the Jewish doctors. It is said (d), <p>"when R. Jochanan ben Zaccai was sick, his disciples went in to visit him; and when he saw them, he began to weep; his disciples said to him, lamp of Israel, , "the right hand pillar", &amp;c. why dost thou weep?'' <p>So another of their Rabbins is said (e) to be <p>"one of the walls,  "and pillars" of the school.'' <p>The character better agrees with these eminent apostles, who when they <p>perceived the grace that was given unto me; meaning not so much the grace of the Spirit of God that was wrought in him, or the good work of grace upon his soul, with which the church at Jerusalem, and the apostles there, had been made acquainted some years before; but the grace and high favour of apostleship, which was conferred upon him, and all those extraordinary gifts of grace, whereby he was qualified for the discharge of it; and particularly the efficacy and success of his ministry through the grace of God which went along with it, and was so visible in it: <p>they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; as a token of a covenant or agreement between them; they took them, as it were, into partnership with them, admitted them as apostles into their society, and gave their full consent, particularly to this article, <p>that we, Paul and Barnabas, <p>should go unto the Heathen, preach among the Gentiles; <p>and they, Peter, and those that were with him, <p>unto the circumcision, and discharge their office among the Jews; and, to show their joint agreement, used the above rite; and which ceremony was used as among other nations (f), so with the Jews, when covenants were made, or partnership was entered into; see <a href="/leviticus/6-2.htm">Leviticus 6:2</a> where the phrase, , "in putting of the hand", and which we render in fellowship, is, both by Onkelos, and Jonathan ben Uzziel, rendered , "in fellowship of the hand", or "by the right hand of fellowship"; that being given in token of their agreement and consent to be partners together, to which the allusion seems to be here; or to the making of proselytes, to whom they "stretch out the hand" to bring them under the wings of the Shekinah (g), or in token of their being proselytes. <p>(d) T.

The mention of his name here <span class="ital">before</span> the other two is not in compliance with the view of the false teachers (Windischmann), but is quite in due form, as the apostle is relating an official act <span class="ital">done in Jerusalem, where</span> James stood at the head of the church (comp. Credner, <span class="ital">Einl</span>. I. 2, p. 571 ff). There is a certain <span class="ital">decorum</span> in this—the tact of a respectful consideration towards the mother-church and its highly-esteemed representative, who, as the Lord’s actual brother, sustained a more peculiar and unique relation to Him than any of the twelve. The higher rank possessed by Peter and the apostles proper generally <span class="ital">as such</span>, is surely enough established by <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a> f. But James, just as the brother of the Lord, had already attained a certain archiepiscopal position in the <span class="ital">Jewish-Christian mother-church</span>, and consequently for Jewish Christianity generally, agreeably to the monarchic principle which was involved in the latter.

The precedence, however, finds its explanation and its justification solely in the <span class="ital">unique</span> personal relation to Christ,—which belonged to none of the apostles. James, as the eldest of the brethren of the Lord (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>; <a href="/mark/6-3.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?

In opposition to the idea of an <span class="ital">alliance</span> being concluded, the objection must not be made (with Hofmann, who finds merely a <span class="ital">promise</span> of fellowship) that the act took place on the part of the apostles only; for, as a matter of course, Paul and Barnabas <span class="ital">clasped</span> the proffered hands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἡμεῖς εἰς τὰ ἔθνη κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] The verb to be supplied must be furnished by the context, and must correspond with <span class="greekheb">εἱς</span>; see Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

Therefore either <span class="greekheb">πορευθῶμεν</span> and <span class="greekheb">πορευθῶσι</span> (Bengel, Fritzsche, Wieseler), or <span class="ital">apostolatu fungeremur</span>, <a href="/galatians/2-8.htm" title="(For he that worked effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)">Galatians 2:8</a> (Erasmus, Schott, and many others), or <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελισώμεθα</span> (Winer, Usteri, de Wette). The latter, in no way unsuitable to <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> (see on <a href="/2_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.">2 Corinthians 10:16</a>), is to be preferred, because it is suggested immediately by the protasis in <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm" title="But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;">Galatians 2:7</a>, from which, at the same time, it is evident that the recognition was not merely that of a <span class="greekheb">συνεργός</span>, but really amounted to an acknowledgment of <span class="ital">apostolic</span> equality (in opposition to Holsten). Moreover, as regards the partition here settled, the <span class="ital">ethnographical</span> bearing of which coincided on the whole with the <span class="ital">local</span> division of territory, we must not supply any such qualification as <span class="ital">praecipue</span> (Bengel, Schott, and others). On the contrary, the agreement was, “<span class="ital">Ye shall be apostles to the Gentiles, and we to the Jews;</span>” and nothing beyond this, except the appended clause in behalf of the poor, was thereby settled: so that the state of things hitherto existing in respect to the field of labour on both sides remained undisturbed. The <span class="ital">modifications</span> of this arrangement obviously and necessarily connected with its <span class="ital">practical</span> working, primarily occasioned by the existence of the Jewish <span class="greekheb">διασπορά</span>—in accordance with which the principle of the division of the spheres of labour could in fact be carried out merely relatively, and without <span class="ital">exclusive</span> geographical. or ethnographical limitation (comp. Lechler, p. 415)—were left an open question, and not discussed. The idea that the recognition of Paul on the part of the apostles was merely external—simply an outward <span class="ital">concordat</span>—and that they themselves would have wished to know nothing of the ministry among the Gentiles (Baur, Zeller), is not conveyed in the text, but is, on the contrary, inconsistent with the representation given <a href="/context/galatians/2-7.htm" title="But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;...">Galatians 2:7-9</a>. According to this, the apostles recognised the twofold <span class="ital">divine call to apostleship</span>, by which two nationally different spheres of labour were to be provided with the one gospel; but a merely external and forced agreement, without any acknowledgment or ratification of the principles and modes of procedure which had long regulated the action of Paul and Barnabas, would have been as little compatible with such a recognition as with the <span class="ital">apostolic character</span> generally. If, however, we take the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> in our passage to be true and heartfelt,[81] then the doubts thrown by Baur and his followers upon the truth of the account of the apostolic council in Acts fall in substance to the ground. How little Paul especially considered his apostolic call to the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> as <span class="ital">excluding</span> the conversion of the Jews from his operations, may be gathered, even laying Acts out of view, from passages such as <a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>, <a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a> ff; <a href="/romans/11-14.htm" title="If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.">Romans 11:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] While <span class="greekheb">ἰδόντες</span> denotes the immediate <span class="ital">impression of the phenomenon</span>, <span class="greekheb">γνόντες</span> represents the <span class="ital">knowledge of reflection</span>. A further step in the description. Hofmann wrongly remarks, “It signifies nothing further than that they <span class="ital">had heard of the occurrence of his calling</span>.” But this they must have already known years before (<a href="/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a> f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] The accentuation usual before Lachmann, <span class="greekheb">στύλοι</span>, is incorrect.

The name of James is placed before those of the Apostles Peter and John. This was probably because as permanent head of the local Church he presided at meetings (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/21-18.htm" title="And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.">Acts 21:18</a>). The well-known strictness of his own legal observance gave special weight to his support of Greek freedom on this occasion. A comparison of his address with the subsequent resolution of the Council suggests that he took a leading part in drafting some part of it at least.—<span class="greekheb">οἱ δοκοῦντες στύλοι εἶναι</span>. The habitual application to the Church of figures borrowed from a temple of God suggested the description of Apostles as pillars. It occurs also in Clement of Rome and Ignatius. The repetition of the phrase <span class="greekheb">οἱ δοκοῦντες</span> is apparently designed to contrast the high estimate formed of the Three with the unfounded and indefinite estimate of others who had proved to be mere names.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> … The mutual understanding between the two groups of Apostles obviously did not imply an absolute restriction of each to one section of the Church. All converts alike were members of a single united Church: circumstances of themselves forbade any definite division: Paul opened his ministry everywhere in the synagogue, and numbered Jews as well as Greeks amidst his converts. So Peter again is next found at Antioch.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. In the Greek the order is, ‘And when they perceived the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John &c.” James (see note <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a>) is named first, because the reference is to a special act of the Church in Jerusalem, of which he was president or Bishop. “When St Paul is speaking of the <span class="ital">missionary</span> office of the Church at large, St Peter holds the foremost place”.

He is put here first, because he mostly remained at Jerusalem, or even because he took the principal lead in this matter, and Paul might have seemed to differ more from James than from Peter, more from Peter than from John. For many circumstances would lead us to conclude, that James and Paul, as well as Peter and Paul, etc., had that in their nature and in the feelings of their soul, which would demand that the one should exercise love and forbearance, along with self-denial, towards the other, without, however, any compromise of the truth recognized by all. Hence it happens, that one and the same man, or one and the same assembly cannot with equal facility comprehend both James and Paul. This is proved in the failure of Luther, who called the epistle of James “an epistle of straw;” but let those who violently arraign him on this account, look at the monstrous feelings which they themselves cherish against Paul. Christ is the only Head, the only Sun; the greatest apostles were only members; nor did these, as individuals, all equally receive the rays of that Sun, but the whole together represented Christ in the apostleship; comp. on their variety, <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/21-19.htm" title="And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;...">Revelation 21:19-20</a>. And the affairs of the Church were so directed by its Divine Head, that James, who was more tenacious of the law, preached to the Jews; Paul, who did not copy others, and was more eager for faith and liberty, preached to the Gentiles; and that thus every one might bring a character and endowments as much adapted as possible to the province assigned to him.—<span class="greekheb">Κηφᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">Cephas</span>) In some way or other, I know not how, this word has the sound of greater veneration than Peter.

This is the order in which the words stand in the Greek, in which the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("perceiving of a certainty") stands co-ordinate with the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("when they saw") of ver. 7, so that this latter participle has "James, Cephas, and John" for its subject equally with the former, and vers. 7 and 9 appear as forming one sentence. The expression, "the grace that was given unto me," occurs also <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>; <a href="/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; in which passages, as well as here, it is used with a definite reference to the office of apostle having been conferred upon him together with the qualification and aid for its efficient discharge. This definite reference to a heavenly gift connected with his official character is prominent in the apostle's use of the word "grace," also in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>. The "grace that was given unto him," therefore, sums up the facts of his having been put in trust of the gospel of the uncircumcision, and of God's having wrought on his behalf in his discharge of that trust, which are presented in the two preceding verses. There is not much difference in the meaning of the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in this verse as compared with the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 7; for as we find the verb "seeing" used with reference to objects not discernible by the bodily sense but perceived only through the medium of evidencing facts, as in ver. 14 of this chapter, and in <a href="/luke/9-47.htm">Luke 9:47</a>; <a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>; <a href="/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>; <a href="/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; so also the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is sometimes used of perceiving, becoming apprised of, some fact, as <a href="/mark/6-38.htm">Mark 6:38</a>; <a href="/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; <a href="/luke/9-11.htm">Luke 9:11</a>; <a href="/john/12-9.htm">John 12:9</a>, when there is no clear intention of emphasizing the idea of certain knowledge. Sometimes, however, it seems as if the writer had such intention, as in <a href="/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; <a href="/mark/15-45.htm">Mark 15:45</a>; <a href="/luke/8-46.htm">Luke 8:46</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>; and probably it was in this more emphatic sense that the apostle here substituted "knowing" for the foregoing "seeing." "James, and Cephas, and John." This James is, no doubt, the same James as appears in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. holding so prominent and apparently presidential a position in the great meeting of vers. 6-21. The "James" of the old triumvirate of the Gospels, "Peter, James, and John," was now no more. This James, whose personality has been discussed above in note on Galatians 1:19, is named first, before even  Cephas and John, though not an apostle, as being the leading "elder" (<span class="accented">bishop</span>, as such a functionary soon got to be designated) of the Church of Jerusalem; for in the classification of the component members of that meeting in <a href="/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6</a>, "the apostles and the elders," James must be assigned to the latter category. The twelve had no distinctive official connection with this particular Church more than with other Churches; and, therefore, in meetings held at Jerusalem, the presidential position would naturally be conceded, not to any one of the apostles, but to the man who was statedly recognized as the superior "elder" of this particular community. St. John's name is not mentioned in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; but in other places in St. Luke's history "Peter and John" are found acting in conjunction, and this in such a manner as to betoken their holding a very prominent place among the apostles (<a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14</a>). The reason why these three are named, and none but these, is probably that on the occasion referred to these three alone - James as on behalf of the Church of Jerusalem, and Peter and John as on behalf of the twelve - stepped forward at the general request before the meeting, and formally all three clasped hands with Paul and Barnabas in token of their recognizing and ratifying their doctrine and ministry. In reference to the name "Cephas,' it may be observed that St. Paul finds occasion to name this apostle nine times; in seven of these he writes, according to the best manuscripts, "Cephas' (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 14</a>); in two, "Peter" (<a href="/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7, 8</a>). The Judaizers in the Church, whether at Corinth or in Galatia, in their morbid hankering after whatever was distinctively Jewish, were sure to affect the use of the Hebraic form; on which account, probably, St. Paul, in dealing with these men, is seen so frequently using this form himself. <span class="accented">Those reputed to be pillars.</span> The apostle's object in adding this clause is apparently, to indicate why these three, rather than any others, represented the rest in this act of formal proceeding, and at the same time to intimate to his Galatian readers the supreme character of the attestation thus afforded, both to that gospel of his which certain among the Galatians were now tampering with, and to his official character which those same persons were beginning to disparage. "Pillars." The apostle, years after, in writing to Timothy, speaks of its being the proper function of "the Church of the living God" that she should be "a pillar and settled basis (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the truth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> upholding the truth (<a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>). This suggests to us his meaning in using the same figure here. Those three men were by general consent looked up to as especially steadfast upholders of the truth of the gospel or of the Christian cause. In <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> the "pillar" seems thought of, not so much as upholding a superstructure as of something itself stationary, and also, perhaps, beautiful and glorious. Clement of Rome, in his Epistle to the Corinthians (&sect; 5), borrows the phrase with a more extensive application. The idea couched in the word "Cephas," <span class="accented">rock</span>, is so nearly identical with that of "settled basis," that the like affinity of ideas as led the apostle to connect "pillar" with the latter term in <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a> may be supposed to have led him now to connect "pillar" with "Cephas" and his two illustrious brethren. <span class="cmt_word">They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); they each of them clasped each of us by the right hand, in token that they both did then, and would thereafter continue to, regard us, and we also them, as partners with one another in a common work. We meet with the phrases, "give right hands," "receive right hands," in 1 Macc. 11:50, 52 1 Macc. 13:50, with reference, apparently, to the victor conceding, and the vanquished accepting, terms of peace to be ratified by the mutual clasp of right hands. This, however, is not precisely what is meant in the present case; there is no room here for the notion of reconciliation. Neither seems there intended a signification of love, such as the "kiss of love" would have afforded. This hand-clasp simply ratified by a palpable gesture the formal assurance between the two parties that they regarded each other as friendly partners in a common undertaking. That the use of this gesture in ratifying compact has been very common in all ages, is shown by the instances in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon' (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), and in Facciolati ("Dextra"), as well as by Bishop Light feet's note on the present passage. Its use among the Jews is attested, not only by the very phrase employed here and in the Maccabees, but by the phrases, "strike hands" and "give one's hand," in <a href="/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>. Josephus's remark in 'Ant.,' 18. 9:3, on the unique inviolability which the Persians, Parthians, and other Oriental nations felt to attach to engagements thus ratified, by no means precludes the supposition that Jews used this gesture of guarantee, but only shows that it was not with them the most sacred of all forms of covenanting: they would, of course, regard an oath by the Name of God as affording a higher sanction. In the case now under consideration there was no "strife" between James, Cephas, and John, and Paul and Barnabas, which needed to be "ended" by "an oath:" the solemn and cordial mutual pressure of the right hand seems just the kind and measure  of form appropriate to the circumstances<span class="cmt_word">. That we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">that we unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">the Gentiles</span>, <span class="accented">and themselves unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">the circumcision</span>, without any verb. We have a very similar ellipsis of the verb in a carefully balanced antithesis, and before the same preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, in <a href="/romans/5-16.htm">Romans 5:16</a> (comp. also <a href="/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>). We may read it either thus, "should go unto," as in both the Authorized and the Revised Versions; or, "should be ministers for," taking the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with the like shade of meaning, as in ver. 8. This distribution of the several provinces of work is shown by the subsequent practice on both sides (see note on ver. 7, <span class="accented">subfin.</span>) to have been intended to be geographical rather than national; which understanding is also indicated by the mention in the next verse of "the poor" whom Paul and Barnabas were, notwithstanding this distribution, to bear in mind; they were the poor <span class="accented">in Judaea</span>, the province of James, Cephas, and John. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who seemed to be pillars (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Better, who are in repute as pillars.

A token of alliance in the apostolic office of preaching and teaching. The giving of the right hand in pledge was not a distinctively Jewish custom. It appears as early as Homer. Deissmann cites an inscription from Pergamum, 98 B. C., in which the Pergamenes offer to adjust the strife between Sardes and Ephesus, and send a mediator &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to give hands for a treaty.

The custom prevailed among the Persians, from whom it may have passed to the Jews. See Joseph. Antiq. 18:9, 3. Images of right hands clasped were sometimes exchanged in token of friendship (see Xen. Anab. ii. 4, 1). Tacitus (Hist. i. 54) says: "The state of the Lingones had sent, according to an ancient institution, right hands, as gifts to the legions, a signal token of good will." On Roman coins often appear two hands joined, with various inscriptions, as Exercituum Fides; Concordia; Consensus. To give the hand in confirmation of a promise occurs <a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>, God swears by his right hand. </body></html>
