Even at this early date there seems to have been a more or less organised system of instruction in the Church. Teaching was regarded as a separate function, though those who took part in it do not seem as yet to have formed a separate class. See <a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="/romans/12-7.htm" title="Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;">Romans 12:7</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28-29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>; <a href="/james/3-1.htm" title="My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.">James 3:1</a> (“masters” should be rather “teachers”).

If, says Macknight, “the teachers, who by spiritual gifts were supernaturally qualified to instruct others, deserved to be liberally maintained, how much more is a liberal maintenance due to those, who, not possessing the [extraordinary] spiritual gifts, are obliged to spend a great deal of time and money in fitting themselves for their office, and who employ themselves assiduously in discharging it!”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Many excuse themselves from the work of religion, though they may make a show, and profess it. They may impose upon others, yet they deceive themselves if they think to impose upon God, who knows their hearts as well as actions; and as he cannot be deceived, so he will not be mocked. Our present time is seed time; in the other world we shall reap as we sow now. As there are two sorts of sowing, one to the flesh, and the other to the Spirit, so will the reckoning be hereafter. Those who live a carnal, sensual life, must expect no other fruit from such a course than misery and ruin. But those who, under the guidance and influences of the Holy Spirit, live a life of faith in Christ, and abound in Christian graces, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. We are all very apt to tire in duty, particularly in doing good. This we should carefully watch and guard against. Only to perseverance in well-doing is the reward promised. Here is an exhortation to all to do good in their places. We should take care to do good in our life-time, and make this the business of our lives.

From the mention of bearing one another's burdens, he passes to one way in which those burdens may be borne&#8212;by ministering out of their earthly goods to their spiritual teachers. The "but" in the Greek, beginning of this verse, expresses this: I said, Each shall bear his own burden; BUT I do not intend that he should not think of others, and especially of the wants of his ministers.<p>communicate unto him&#8212;"impart a share unto his teacher": literally, "him that teacheth catechetically."<p>in all good things&#8212;in every kind of the good things of this life, according as the case may require (Ro 15:27; 1Co 9:11, 14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let him that is taught in the word:</span> the word here translated <span class="ital">taught, </span> signifieth catechised; and is the same word from which that word is derived; but it here signifieth <span class="ital">taught, </span> catechising being but a mode or species of teaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things; </span> the precept is concerning the maintenance of ministers, which is fitly expressed by the term <span class="ital">communicate, </span> because as the people distribute to their ministers things temporal, so the ministers distribute things spiritual.

The text teacheth us, that it is the will of God that ministers should be maintained at the charge of the church to which they minister, and it is but an act of justice, for they do but communicate temporal things to those who communicate to them much more valuable things. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let him that is taught in the word,.... Instructed in the knowledge of the word, either of the essential Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, of his person, office, and grace; or rather of the written word, particularly the Gospel, which is sometimes called the word, without any additional epithet, which distinguishes it, and directs to the sense of it; and sometimes with such, as the words of truth, the word of faith, the word of righteousness, the word of reconciliation, and the word of this salvation, so called from the nature, use, and subject matter of it. He that is taught in this, is, according to the original word used here, a "catechumen"; and which designs not one that is just beginning to learn the first principles of the oracles of God, but anyone that is instructed in it, as this word is rendered in <a href="/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a> whether more or less, or whether internally or externally: one that is internally taught in and by the word, is one that has been taught to know himself, and his lost state by nature; to know Christ, and salvation by him; to know the truths of the Gospel, and to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly. It may include everyone that is only outwardly taught, that is but an external hearer; and so the Syriac version renders the clause, , "he that hears the word": of which there are many sorts, and on whom it is an incumbent duty to <p>communicate to him that teacheth; who is commissioned, and qualified and sent forth by Christ, and whose office in the church is to teach the word, to preach the Gospel, to instruct men in the truths of it, and teach them their duty also to God and men, such are to be communicated to; that is, such as are under their instructions ought to impart of their worldly substance to them, for their honourable and comfortable support and maintenance; for since they spend their time, and make use of their talents, gifts, and abilities, for their instruction in spiritual things, it is but reasonable, and no such great matter, that they partake of their carnal things; and especially since it is the will and ordinance of Christ, that they that preach the Gospel should live of it. The apostle adds, <p>in all good things; which may be either connected with the word "teacheth", and so be descriptive of the teacher, as the Arabic version reads, "him that teacheth all his good things"; good doctrines, excellent truths, the wholesome words of Christ, which he is intrusted with, has a knowledge and experience of; and who freely and faithfully imparts them, and conceals and keeps back nothing, but declares the whole counsel of God, all that he knows, and that is good and profitable; and carries in it a very strong argument why he should be communicated to: or else with the word "communicate"; and the sense either be, let him be a partaker of, and join with him in everything he says or does that is good, but not in anything that is evil, which is a sense some give into; or rather let him impart of his temporal good things unto him: temporal things are good as they are of God, and in themselves, and when rightly used answer good purposes; all a man's good things are not to be communicated, only a part, according to his ability, and in proportion to others; and yet the communication should be large and liberal, sufficient to support the teacher in an honourable manner, and to supply him with all the necessaries of life, that his mind may be free from secular cares, and he be at leisure to attend to the instructing of others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> all good things.</span><p>(5) It is fitting that teachers should be helped by their students, as much as they are able.<p>(f) Of whatever he has according to his ability.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/6-6.htm" title="Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.">Galatians 6:6</a>.

So, following Marcion (?) (in Jerome) and Lyra, in modern times Aug. Herm. Franke (in Wolf), who, however, improperly connects <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν ἀγαθοῖς</span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΗΧΟῦΝΤΙ</span></span></span>, Hennicke, <span class="ital">de nexu loci Gal.</span> vi. 1–10, Lips. 1788; Mynster, <span class="ital">kl. theol.

Usually, however (as by Winer, Rückert, Usteri, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Hilgenfeld, Ewald, Wieseler, Hofmann, Reithmayr, and others), there is found in the words a summons to <span class="ital">liberality towards the teachers</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν ἀγαθοῖς</span> is taken as referring to the communication of <span class="ital">everything good</span> (Ewald), or more definitely, of all <span class="ital">earthly good things</span> (“in omni facultatum genere, ut usu venit,” Bengel), or of <span class="ital">good things of every hind</span> (Ellicott, Hofmann); and <span class="greekheb">κοινωνείτω</span> is taken either <span class="ital">transitively</span> (so usually, also by Ewald), as if the word were equivalent to <span class="greekheb">κοινοῦν</span> (as to the distinction between the two, see especially Thuc. i. 39. 3): <span class="ital">communicet</span> (which, however, cannot be conclusively established in the N.T., not even in <a href="/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>; and in the passages from Greek authors in Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom</span>. III. p. 81, and Bremi, <span class="ital">ad Aeschin</span>. p. 317, Goth, it is to be referred to the idea: “<span class="ital">to share with any one</span>”), or <span class="ital">intransitively</span> (so Usteri, de Wette, Wieseler): “<span class="ital">let him stand in fellowship</span>,” namely by communication, or in the sense of the <span class="ital">participation</span> in the teacher, which is perfected <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν ἀγ</span>. (Hofmann, comparing <a href="/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>). But against the whole of this interpretation may be urged: (1) the singular want of connection of such a summons, not merely with what goes before,[253] but also with what follows,[254] wherein Paul inculcates Christian morality generally. (2) Since in <a href="/context/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted....">Galatians 6:1-5</a> <span class="ital">moral</span> faultiness was the point in question, the reference which most naturally suggests itself for <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν ἀγαθοῖς</span> is a reference to <span class="ital">moral</span> good. (3) At the conclusion of this whole section in <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐργαζώμεθα τὸ ἀγαθὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθόν</span> is nothing else than the <span class="ital">morally</span> good. (4) The requirement itself, to communicate with the teacher <span class="ital">in all good things</span>, would, without more precise definition (Luther, 1538: Paul desires simply, “<span class="ital">ut liberaliter eos alant, quantum satis est ad vitam commode tuendam</span>,”—an idea which is not suggested in the passage), be so indeterminate and, even under the point of view of the possession as common property, <a href="/acts/4-32.htm" title="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.">Acts 4:32</a> (de Wette), which we do not meet with in Paul’s writings, so little to be justified, that we cannot venture to attribute it—thus thrown out without any defining limitation—to the apostle, least of all in a letter addressed to churches in which misinterpretations and misuse on the part of antagonistic teachers were to he apprehended. Through the stress laid by Wieseler on the spiritual <span class="ital">counter-service</span> of the teacher (comp. also Hofmann), the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν ἀγαθοῖς</span>, seeing that it must always involve that which is to be given by the disciples to their teacher, is by no means reduced to its just measure (the bodily maintenance as recompense for the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕΥΜΆΤΙΚΑ</span></span></span> received, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Php 4:15</a>); whilst Ewald’s interpretation, “communication <span class="ital">in all good things</span>,”[255] cannot be linguistically vindicated either for <span class="greekheb">κοινων</span>. or for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> (= <span class="greekheb">ב</span>, according to <span class="ital">Sprachl</span>. p. 484 f.). Paul would have said perhaps: <span class="greekheb">κοινὰ ποιείτω ὁ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῷ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα ἀγαθά</span>, or something similar in correct Greek. The objection raised against our interpretation (see Rückert, Usteri, Hilgenfeld, Wieseler), that it is difficult to see why this particular relation of disciple and teacher should be brought into prominence, is obviated by the consideration that this very relation had been much disturbed among the Galatians by the influence of the pseudo-apostles (<a href="/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>), and this disturbance could not but be in the highest degree an obstacle to the success of their common moral effort and life. But in reference to de Wette’s objection that <span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖν</span>, instead of <span class="greekheb">μιμεῖσθαι</span>, is a strange expression, it must be observed that Paul wished to express not at all the idea of <span class="greekheb">μιμεῖσθαι</span>, but only that of the Christian <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> between disciple and teacher. The disciple is not to leave the sphere of the morally good to the teacher alone, and on his own part to busy himself in other interests and follow other ways; but he is to strive and work in common with his teacher in the same sphere. In this view, the expression is (in opposition to Hofmann’s objection) neither too wide nor too narrow. Not too wide, because the sphere of moral good is one and the same for teachers and learners, and it is only the concrete application which is different. Not too narrow, because moral fellowship in Christian church-life finds its most effective lever in the fact that learner and teacher go hand in hand in all that is good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ κατηχούμενος τὸν λόγον</span>] Comp. <a href="/acts/18-25.htm" title="This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.">Acts 18:25</a>.

The dative <span class="greekheb">τῷ κατηχ</span>. is the <span class="ital">dativus communionis</span> everywhere common (Dem. 142, <span class="ital">ult</span>. 789. 2).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[252] The question, whether the persons here meant were permanent teachers of the church, or itinerant evangelists, is to be answered by saying that neither of these two kinds of teachers is excluded. For although at that time there were no <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλοι</span> specially instituted except the presbyters (see on <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>), there were nevertheless members of the church endowed with the <span class="greekheb">χάρισμα διδασκαλίας</span>, who devoted themselves to the function of continuous instruction in their churches. <a href="/romans/12-7.htm" title="Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;">Romans 12:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[253] The connection with <span class="ital">what goes before</span> might be <span class="ital">dispensed with</span>, for Paul might (through <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>) have passed on to a fresh subject. Winer, indeed, conceives the connection to be: “cum vv. 4, 5 ea tetigisset, quae <span class="ital">priva</span> sibi quisque habere debeat, nunc ad haec descendere, quae cum aliis <span class="ital">communicanda</span> sunt” (comp. Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.). But, with the precept of <span class="ital">liberality</span> towards teachers, so entirely alien to what goes before, this connection appears forced; and it would be better to forego any connecting link with what precedes (Rückert) than to bring out an illogical relation of the contrast. De Wette discovers a satisfactory connection with vv. 1–5 in the circumstance that there, as here, the apostle has in view defects of Christian social life. This, however, is to specify not a connection, but merely a logical category. According to Ewald, the previous counsels are to be conceived as for the most part addressed to the Pauline teachers of the Galatians, and Paul therefore now adds a word as to the correct behaviour of the non-teachers also. But the former idea is assumed without ground in the text, which speaks quite <span class="ital">generally</span>. According to Wieseler the conception is, that the care for worldly maintenance was a species of the <span class="greekheb">βάρη</span> (ver. 2), which the readers were to relieve them of in return for their being instructed in the word. But those <span class="greekheb">βάρη</span> are necessarily of a <span class="ital">moral</span> nature, burdens of <span class="ital">guilt</span>. According to Hofmann, Paul has previously exhorted every one to serve his neighbour with <span class="ital">that which he is</span>, and now exhorts every one to employ <span class="ital">that which he possesses</span>, as his Christian position requires. A scheme of thought purely artificial, and gratuitously introduced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[254] The sequel down to ver. 10 is indeed referred by Luther (most consistently in 1538) and others, including Olshausen and de Wette, with more or with less (Koppe, de Wette, Hilgenfeld) consistency, to the <span class="ital">behaviour towards the teachers</span>, by the despising of whom God is mocked, the support of whom is a sowing of seed for spiritual objects, etc. But looking at the general nature of the following instructions, which there is not a word to limit, how arbitrary and forced is this view! Not less far-fetched and forced is the explanation of Hofmann, who considers that, because by means of the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. the teacher is enabled to attend to his own business, Paul in vv. 7 ff. warns against the erroneous opinion that people might, without danger to the soul, deal lightly with that <span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; that by means of this <span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖν</span> people devote that which they possess to the Spirit, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[255] Comp.

The word <span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖν</span> contains the key to the true meaning of this verse. Our versions understand it here, and in <a href="/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>, <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Php 4:15</a>, in the sense of <span class="ital">communicating</span> to others; but I can find no warrant for this in Greek usage. In <a href="/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a> it signifies distinctly to <span class="ital">receive</span> a share, and elsewhere to become a partner (<span class="greekheb">κοινωνὸς γενέσθαι</span>) and share in common with others (<a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1 Timothy 5:22</a>, <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1 Peter 4:13</a>, <a href="/2_john/1-11.htm" title="For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.">2 John 1:11</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>). Here in like manner it enjoins upon the leaders of the Churches the duty of admitting all the members to participation in any spiritual blessings they enjoy. It continues, in fact, the protest against the arrogant pretensions and selfish exclusiveness of Judaising leaders.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγαθοῖς</span>. It is impossible to restrict this word to mere worldly goods, except where the language of the context suggests or warrants such a restriction, as is the case in <a href="/luke/12-18.htm" title="And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.">Luke 12:18</a>; <a href="/luke/16-25.htm" title="But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.">Luke 16:25</a>.

When we consider that most of the instruction in the Word (i.e. the Gospel revelation) was <span class="ital">oral</span>, and that it was not limited to preaching in the assemblies of the Church, but extended to households and individuals, the work of the teacher must have been very arduous, demanding all his time and energies. Hence the necessity of proper provision being made for his maintenance. Exhortations to this effect are found in the ‘Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,’ a document of the sub-Apostolic age.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in all good things</span>] Those earthly things which men generally covet are designated ‘goods’ or ‘good things’, <a href="/context/luke/12-18.htm" title="And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods....">Luke 12:18-19</a>; <a href="/luke/16-25.htm" title="But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.">Luke 16:25</a>. In all of these, whether money, or food, or clothing or the like, the taught is to ‘communicate’ with the teacher, share them with him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">6–10</span>. These verses, which are an exhortation to the exercise of liberality towards the Teachers of the Church, do not seem to have any obvious connexion with what has gone before. They <span class="ital">may</span> have been suggested as a particular application of the general principle, ‘bear ye one another’s burdens’. But we so often meet with a number of disconnected injunctions at the end of St Paul’s Epistles, that this abrupt introduction of this paragraph need cause no difficulty. The connecting particle, ‘but’ or ‘moreover’, omitted in A.V. is restored in R.V. The duty here enjoined is frequently insisted upon by St Paul, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?...">1 Corinthians 9:11-14</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-17.htm" title="Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.">Php 4:17</a>; <a href="/context/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine....">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>.

It is, in fact, here merely a conjunction of transition: not in any degree adversative; for the exhortation to liberality towards our teachers is perfectly germane to the preceding topics of carrying  one another's loads, and so carrying our own pack. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, etymologically "to fill with sound," thence signifies "to din a thing into another person's mind with inculcation or constant repetition," in which sense it occurs in <a href="/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21, 24</a>, of the persistent repetition of a slanderous report. So early as in Hippocrates (Liddell and Scott) the verbal substantive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is used for "instruction;" and the verb, though not occurring in Attic writers, seems to have continued in use in other dialects, to reappear at length in the Common Dialect of Greek. Accordingly, it is found in the sense of "instruct" in <a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>; <a href="/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>. It does not denote instruction by question and answer in particular, but simply the inculcating of knowledge. Recently as the Galatian Churches had been founded, it appears from this passage that there were already persons among them whose particular business it was to give religious instruction to their fellow-Christians; so much their business, that they were on this ground entitled to receive from those they taught liberal help in temporal things. Such persons were doubtless included among the "elders" whom Paul and Barnabas appointed in the several Churches which they planted (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). It is noticeable, further, that the order of men alone singled out as entitled to such secular assistance is characterized as a teaching order; so characterized, per-hops, because teaching religious truth was the most prominent and characteristic of their functions. In his First Epistle to Timothy (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>), written, probably, some years later, "the elders who labour in Word and teaching (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)" are particularized as those among the "presiding elders" who are the "most especially" entitled to liberal payment; the form of expression, however, implying that elders whose function lay in other duties than that of teaching were likewise entitled to liberal consideration. The teaching elders would require, more than other Church officers, leisure from worldly avocations for the study of God's Word and his truth, and for the actual discharge of their especial work in private as well as in public (comp. <a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>). The direction here given would apply, as to the case of resident teachers, so also to that of persons who travelled about in the dissemination of the faith; as we learn from <a href="/1_corinthians/9-4.htm">1 Corinthians 9:4-14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7-12</a>. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13</a> the apostle commends to the "high estimation" of the disciples "those who laboured among them, and were ever them in the Lord, and admonished them (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>);   The expression "the Word" is used without any further qualification to designate the Christian doctrine, as in <a href="/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>; <a href="/mark/4-14.htm">Mark 4:14</a>; <a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>; <a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-14.htm">Philippians 1:14</a>. So the Christian religion is styled "the Way" in <a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>. "Share;' the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and its derivatives are frequently used with reference to that kind of "fellowship" or "partnership" which is evinced by our liberally sharing with the object of it in our worldly means. If we "count a minister our partner (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)," as St. Paul writes to Philemon (ver. 17), we shall not begrudge him frank and generous help in any direction. Thus <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>, "Communicating to the necessities of saints," is properly "sharing with them in generous sympathy." So <a href="/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14</a>, "had fellowship with (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) my affliction" points to liberal temporal assistance. Similarly, generous sympathy embodied in money gifts is styled "communion," or "partnership," in <a href="/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>; as also <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "ready to communicate," expresses one ready to show such sympathy, in <a href="/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>. The apostle regards, and would have others regard, such offices of kindness with a fine delicate feeling, not as giving as if from a higher level of condition, but as sharing with brothers, with whom all things are held in common. Chrysostom and others consider the word to point to an interchange or barter of goods, spiritual and temporal, referring to <a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>. "In all good things;" in all good things of this life which he himself possesses. "Good things" as in <a href="/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18, 19</a> ("my goods"); Luke 16:25; the preposition "in," as in <a href="/matthew/23-30.htm">Matthew 23:30</a>, "partakers in the blood of the prophets." The exact import of this clause, which has been variously interpreted, is best appreciated by our taking account of the warmth of indignant feeling with which the apostle is writing. This clearly transpires both from the words, "be not deceived," and from the assurance, "God is not mocked." The apostle had evidently in his eye a certain course of conduct which he indignantly denounces as a "sneering at God." This feeling prompts him to accentuate his exhortation addressed to the cold-hearted, niggardly Christians whom he has in view, by adding this clause, which is in effect, "in every possible way;" namely, by giving them respect and good will as well as maintenance. To no other Church does he address such direct admonition respecting the liberal treatment of its teachers, though, perhaps, indirect admonition may be detected in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7-11</a>. No doubt the news he had just heard from Galatia made him feel the necessity of dealing with them roundly on this point. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But, although each man is thus individualized as regards his burdens, Christian fellowship in all morally good things is to be maintained between the teacher and the taught. The passage is often explained as an injunction to provide for the temporal wants of Christian teachers. But this is entirely foreign to the course of thought, and isolates the verse from the context on both sides of it. As <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1-5</a> refer to moral errors, in all good things has naturally the same reference, as do good in <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a> certainly has. The exhortation therefore is, that the disciple should make common cause with the teacher in everything that is morally good and that promotes salvation. The introduction at this point of the relation of disciple and teacher may be explained by the fact that this relation in the Galatian community had been disturbed by the efforts of the Judaising teachers, notably in the case of Paul himself; and this disturbance could not but interfere with their common moral effort and life.<p>Him that is taught (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>.<p>In the word (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The gospel.
