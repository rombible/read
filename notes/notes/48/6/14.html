The cross of Christ was “to the Jews a stumbling-block.” They attached to it only ideas of ignominy and shame, and yet it is precisely this of which the Apostle is most proud. He is proud of it as the ground of his salvation, and therefore as the cardinal object of all his hopes and aims.<p><span class= "bld">By whom.</span>—It seems better, on the whole, to adopt the marginal rendering: <span class= "ital">whereby.</span> The antecedent is thus not Christ, but more especially the <span class= "ital">cross</span> of Christ.

Or, as Dr. Doddridge paraphrases the clause, By the reliance which I have for justification on Christ’s sufferings and death, and by the believing views I have thereof, I am made indifferent to all things here below; “so that I view the world, as little impressed by all its charms, as a spectator would be by any thing which had been graceful in the countenance of a crucified person, when he beholds it blackened in the agonies of death; and am no more affected by the objects round me, than one who is expiring would be struck with any of those prospects which his dying eyes might view from the cross on which he was suspended.” Or, more concisely, the world is crucified to believers, in that, by the firm expectation of eternal life, grounded on Christ’s cross, that is, on his death and resurrection, <span class="ital">the world, </span>like the dead carcass of a crucified malefactor, is stripped to them of all its vain allurements. And they are crucified to the world by Christ’s cross, in that “it inspires them with such principles, and leads them to such a course of life, as renders them, in the eyes of the world, as contemptible, and as unfit for their purposes, as if they were dead carcasses. All believers, therefore, after the apostle’s example, justly glory in the crucifixion of their Master, not only as it is the foundation of that assured hope of pardon which they entertain, but as it is an effectual principle of their sanctification.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:12-15 Proud, vain, and carnal hearts, are content with just so much religion as will help to keep up a fair show. But the apostle professes his own faith, hope, and joy; and that his principal glory was in the cross of Christ. By which is here meant, his sufferings and death on the cross, the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Redeemer. By Christ, or by the cross of Christ, the world is crucified to the believer, and he to the world. The more we consider the sufferings of the Redeemer from the world, the less likely shall we be to love the world. The apostle was as little affected by its charms, as a beholder would be by any thing which had been graceful in the face of a crucified person, when he beholds it blackened in the agonies of death. He was no more affected by the objects around him, than one who is expiring would be struck with any of the prospects his dying eyes might view from the cross on which he hung. And as to those who have truly believed in Christ Jesus, all things are counted as utterly worthless compared with him. There is a new creation; old things are passed away, and new views and dispositions are brought in under the regenerating influences of God the Holy Spirit. Believers are brought into a new world, and being created in Christ Jesus unto good works, are formed to a life of holiness. It is a change of mind and heart, whereby we are enabled to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to live to God; and where this inward, practical religion is wanting, outward professions, or names, will never stand in any stead.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But God forbid - See the note at <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>. "For me it is not to glory except in the cross of Christ." The object of Paul here is evidently to place himself in contrast with the judaizing teachers, and to show his determined purpose to glory in nothing else but the cross of Christ. Well they knew that he had as much occasion for glorying in the things pertaining to the flesh, or in the observance of external rites and customs, as any of them. He had been circumcised. He had had all the advantages of accurate training in the knowledge of the Jewish law. He had entered on life with uncommon advantages. He had evinced a zeal that was not surpassed by any of them; and his life, so far as conformity to the religion in which he had been trained was concerned, was blameless; <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-8</a>. This must have been to a great extent known to the Galatians; and by placing his own conduct in strong contrast with that of the Judaizing teachers, and showing that he had no ground of confidence in himself, he designed to bring back the minds of the Galatians to simple dependence on the cross.<p>That I should glory - That I should boast; or that I should rely on any thing else. Others glory in their conformity to the laws of Moses; others in their zeal, or their talents, or their learning, or their orthodoxy; others in their wealth, or their accomplishments; others in their family alliances, and their birth; but the supreme boast and glorying of a Christian is in the cross of Christ.<p>In the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ - In Jesus the crucified Messiah. It is a subject of rejoicing and glorying that we have such a Saviour. The world looked upon him with contempt; and the cross was a stumbling-block to the Jew, and folly to the Greek. Notes, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>. But to the Christian, that cross is the subject of glorying. It is so because:<p>(1) Of the love of him who suffered there;<p>(2) Of the purity and holiness of his character, for the innocent died there for the guilty;<p>(3) Of the honor there put on the Law of God by his dying to maintain it unsullied;<p>(4) Of the reconciliation there made for sin, accomplishing what could be done by no other oblation, and by no power of man;<p>(5) Of the pardon there procured for the guilty;<p>(6) Of the fact that through it we become dead to the world, and are made alive to God;<p>(7) Of the support and consolation which goes from that cross to sustain us in trial; and,<p>(8) Of the fact that it procured for us admission into heaven, a title to the world of glory. All is glory around the cross.<p>It was a glorious Saviour who died; it was glorious love that led him to die; it was a glorious object to redeem a world; and is is unspeakable glory to which he will raise lost and ruined sinners by his death. O who would not glory in such a Saviour! Compared with this, what trifles are all the objects in which people usually boast! And what a lesson is here furnished to the true Christian! Let us not boast of our wealth. It will soon leave us, or we shall be taken from it, and it can aid us little in the great matters that are before us. It will not ward off disease; it will not enable us to bear pain; it will not smooth the couch of death; it will not save the soul. Let us not glory in our strength, for it will soon fail; in our beauty, for we shall soon be undistinguished in the corruptions of the tomb; in our accomplishments, for they will not save us; in our learning, for it is not that by which we can be brought to heaven. But let us glory that we have for a Saviour the eternal Son of God - that glorious Being who was adored by the inhabitants of heaven; who made the worlds; who is pure, and lovely, and most holy; and who has undertaken our cause and died to save us. I desire no higher honor than to be saved by the Son of God. It is the exaltation of my nature, and shows me more than anything else its true dignity, that one so great and glorious sought my redemption. That cannot be an object of temporary value which he sought by coming from heaven, and if there is any object of real magnitude in this world, it is the soul which the eternal Son of God died to redeem.<p>By whom the world is crucified unto me ... - See the notes at <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Here only in the New Testament does it form a syntactical part of a sentence. But in the Septuagint this construction is of repeated occurrence, following the Hebrew construction of <span class="accented">chali'lah</span> with a dative and an infinitive verb with <span class="accented">min.</span> Thus <a href="/genesis/44-7.htm">Genesis 44:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>.; id., 17. So <a href="/joshua/24-16.htm">Joshua 24:16</a>. The pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> is strongly emphasized both in this first clause of the verse and in that which follows. The apostle is vividly contrasting his own feeling and behaviour in relation to the cross of Christ with those of the leaders of the circumcision party whom he has been denouncing. They would fain put the cross as far as possible out of sight, not to offend the Jews they were so anxious to conciliate - that "obnoxious object" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>) itself, as well as the inferences which the apostle taught them to draw from it in relation to the ceremonial law: <span class="accented">their</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, that whereof they would glory, should be in preference the mutilated flesh of their misled Galatian brethren; <span class="accented">his</span> boast, rejoicing, glory, was, and God helping him should ever be, the cross of Christ <span class="accented">-</span> that, and that alone. It quite emasculates the energy of his utterance to paraphrase "the cross" as being "the doctrine of the cross or of Christ's atonement." Rather, it is the cross itself which rivets his admiring view; sneered at by Gentile, abhorred by Jew, but to his eye resplendent with a multiplicity of truths radiating from it to his soul of infinite preciousness. Among those truths, one group, which to us is apt to appear of but small interest, was to the apostle's heart and conscience productive of profoundest relief. In former days he had experienced the burden and the chafing or benumbing effect of the Law, both as a ceremonial institute and as a "letter" of merely imperative command. It was the cross which released him, as from the guilt and servitude  of <span class="accented">sin</span>, so also from all the worry and distress of bondage to ceremonial prescriptions. And this group of truths, as well as those relating to man's reconciliation with God, he felt it to be his mission, even perhaps his own most especial mission, boldly and frankly to proclaim; not only to rejoice in them on his own behalf, but to hold them forth to the view of others, as replete with blessing to all mankind; to glorify and vaunt them. His motive at present in thus vehemently protesting his own rejoicing in the cross of Christ was doubtless to rouse into fresh activity the slumbering sympathy with those feelings which had probably in some degree once animated his Galatian converts. Therefore it is that he writes, "the cross of <span class="accented">our</span> Lord Jesus Christ," instead of "the cross of <span class="accented">my</span> Lord," which it would else have been in this case natural to him to say, as he does in <a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>, "for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord," and according to the tone of <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a> of this Epistle. This "our" hints to the Galatians that they have as much reason as he has to glory in the cross as redeeming God's people alike from sin and from the Law. <span class="cmt_word">By whom</span> (or, <span class="accented">whereby</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>]); <span class="accented">through which the world has been crucified unto me</span>, <span class="accented">and I unto the world.</span> The omission of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, which is now generally agreed in, adds to the terseness of the sentence. The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> elsewhere, as <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. The construing of the passage which takes the relative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> as reciting "our Lord Jesus Christ," loses sight of the image which is now the one most prominent to the apostle's view: this surely is not Christ himself, but his cross; as in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a> the apostle determines the more general term, "Jesus Christ," by the more specific one, "and him crucified." The reference of the relative is to be determined, here as often elsewhere, not by the mere propinquity of words in the sentence, but by the nearness of objects to the writer's mind at the moment. In language of singular intensity the apostle bespeaks the all-involving transformation which, through the cross of Christ, his own life had undergone. The world, he says, had become to him a thing crucified: not only a <span class="accented">dead</span> thing, ceasing to interest or attract him, but also a <span class="accented">vile</span>, <span class="accented">accursed</span> thing, something he loathed and despised. And conversely, he himself had become a crucified thing unto the world; not only had he ceased to present to the world ought that could interest or attract it, but also become to it a thing scorned and abhorred; as he says <a href="/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>, "We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things." The whole context of those words in the Corinthians (vers. 9-13) is here compressed into the single clause, "I have been crucified unto the world." "The world;" the term denotes unregenerate mankind taken in connection with that entire system of habits of life and of feeling in which man, as un-quickened by the Spirit of God, finds his sphere and home. As the apostle is speaking of his own personal experience, we must understand him as referring in particular to all those circumstances of civil, social, and religious being which had once surrounded him, the honoured Jew and Pharisee. These he enumerates at length in <a href="//niv.scripturetext.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5, 6</a>. To these we might add, though it would, perhaps, have hardly occurred to Paul's own mind to add it, the ordinary possession of worldly comforts and immunity from want and suffering. All, he proceeds in that passage to say, he had "forfeited" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>). Nor did he look back upon his loss with regret: "I do count them as dung (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>)." This twofold description, "I forfeited all things," and "I do count them all as dung," is here summarized in the phrase, "the world is a crucified object to me." The world, further, thus described as crucified to him, included in particular the entire system of Jewish ceremonialism, so far as it existed apart from the vitalizing influence of the Spirit of God. The "natural man (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)" sets great store by religious ceremonialism; it is to him, in fact, his religion. The apostle has himself felt it to be so. But his sentiment now is the very opposite: he accounts it a dead, lifeless thing; nay, even loathsome and abhorred, whenever in the smallest degree placed even by a Christian <span class="accented">Jew</span> in the category of Christianly obedience. That he did regard such religious ceremonialism as belonging to the "world," from which as in Christ he had become dissevered, is plain, both from <a href="/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, "in bondage under the rudiments of the world," and from <a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>, "why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourself to ordinances, Handle not," etc. That this particular ingredient in the whole system recited as "the world" was at this moment present to the apostle's mind, appears from his singling out circumcision for mention in the next verse. While, however, this was a part of the "crucified world" just now prominent to his view, this term comprised to his consciousness much beside; namely, the entire mass of ungodliness and vice which appertains to "the course, <span class="accented">or</span> age, of this world" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>), from which <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, the Christian is by the daily transforming of his character to be removed (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).  (See above, <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>, and note.) "Through which;" in various ways was the cress of Christ the means of effecting this mutual crucifixion between the apostle and the world. It is apparent, from the whole tenor of his Epistles, that Christ crucified, as manifesting both Christ's love to sinful men in general, and to his own self in particular, "the chief of sinners," and likewise the love of God his Father, wrought with so mighty an attraction upon his whole soul - intellect, conscience, affections - that all other objects which were only not connected with this one lost to him their whole zest and interest, while all other objects which clashed with the moral and spiritual influence of this became absolutely distasteful and repulsive. And, on the other hand, the world at large met the man who was animated with this absorbing devotion to God as manifested in a crucified Christ, with just that estrangedness and aversion which might have been anticipated. The influence exercised by the cross in crucifying the world and the apostle to each other was intensified by the especial bearing which, in the apostle's view, the cross had towards Jewish ceremonialism (see <a href="//niv.scripturetext.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>, and notes). The vivid, intense manner in which the apostle proclaimed such sentiments alienated from him the adherents and champions of Judaism, and made him of all Christians the one who was to them the most obnoxious. And how this affected his standing, even in the Gentile world, there have been above repeated occasions for noting. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Contrast of Paul's own boasting and its ground with those of the false apostles.<p>By whom (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;' &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;)<p>The relative may refer either to the cross, by which, or to Christ, by whom.
