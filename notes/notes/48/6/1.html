So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Brethren, if a man be overtaken - Margin, "Although." It is a case which the apostle supposes might happen. Christians were not perfect; and it was possible that they who were true Christians might be surprised by temptation, and fall into sin. The word rendered "be overtaken" (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#837;  prole&#772;mphthe&#772; from &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  prolambano&#772;), means properly "to take before another, to anticipate" <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>; then "to be before taken or caught"; and may here mean either that one had been formerly guilty of sin or had been recently hurried on by his passions or by temptations to commit a fault. It is probable that the latter here is the true sense, and that it means, if a man is found to be overtaken by any sin; if his passions, or if temptation get the better of him. Tyndale renders it: "If any man be fallen by chance into any fault." It refers to cases of surprise, or of sudden temptation. Christians do not commit sin deliberately, and as a part of the plan of life; but they may be surprised by sudden temptation, or urged on by impetuous or headstrong passion, as David and Peter were. Paul does not speak of the possibility of restoring one who deliberately forms the plan of sinning; he does not suppose that such a man could be a Christian, and that it would be proper to speak of restoring such a man.<p>Ye which are spiritual - Who are under the influences of the Holy Spirit; see the note at <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. The apostle, in this verse, refers evidently to those who have fallen into some sensual indulgence <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, and says that they who have escaped these temptations, and who are under the influences of the Spirit, should recover such persons. It is a very important qualification for those who would recover others from sin, that they should not be guilty of the same sin themselves. Reformers should be holy persons; people who exercise discipline in the church should be "spiritual" men - people in whom implicit confidence may be properly reposed.<p>Restore such an one - On the meaning of the word used here, see the note at <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>. Here it means, not to restore him to the church after he has been excluded, but set him right, bring him back, recover him from his errors and his faults. The apostle does not say in what manner this is to be done; but it is usually to be done doubtless by affectionate admonition, by faithful instruction, and by prayer. Discipline or punishment should not be resorted to until the other methods are tried in vain; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>.<p>In the spirit of meekness - With a kind, forbearing, and forgiving spirit; see the note at <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>. Not with anger; not with a lordly and overbearing mind; not with a love of finding others in fault, and with a desire for inflicting the discipline of the church; not with a harsh and unforgiving temper, but with love, and gentleness, and humility, and patience, and with a readiness to forgive when wrong has been done. This is an essential qualification for restoring and recovering an offending brother. No one should attempt to rebuke or admonish another who cannot do it in the spirit of meekness; no man should engage in any way in the work of reform who has not such a temper of mind.<p>Considering thyself ... - Remembering how liable you are yourself to err; and how much kindness and indulgence should therefore be shown to others. You are to act as if you felt it possible that you might also be overtaken with a fault; and you should act as you would wish that others should do toward you. Pliny (Epis. viii. 22) has expressed a similar sentiment in the following beautiful language. "Atque ego optimum et emendatissimum existimo, qui caeteris ita ignoscit, tanquam ipse quotidie peccet; ita peccatis abstinet, tanquam nemini ignoscat. Prolade hoc domi, hoc foris, hoc in omni vitae genere teneamus, ut nobis implacabiles simus, exorabiles istis etiam, qui dare veniam nisi sibi nesciunt." The doctrine taught by Paul is, that such is human infirmity, and such the strength of human depravity, that no one knows into what sins he may himself fall. He may be tempted to commit; the same sins which he endeavors to amend in others; he may be left to commit even worse sins. If this is the case, we should be tender while we are firm; forgiving while we set our faces against evil; prayerful while we rebuke; and compassionate when we are compelled to inflict on others the discipline of the church. Everyone who has any proper feelings, when he attempts to recover an erring brother should pray for him and for himself also; and will regard his duty as only half done, and that very imperfectly, if he does not "consider also that he himself may be tempted." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Ga 6:1-18.

Or "be taken before" in one; not, as Grotius thinks, before this epistle should come to them, which is a very jejune and empty sense of the words; nor before the conversion of the man, because sins before conversion do not come under the notice and cognizance of a church, or are liable to its reproofs and censures; but before the man is aware, through negligence and imprudence, for want of caution and circumspection, and so is carried away, either through the treachery of his own heart, and the power of corruption; or through the temptations of Satan, who goes about, and comes on the back of them, lays snares for them, and attacks them unawares, and takes all advantages of them; or by the ill examples of others, whereby they are drawn aside, and into sin. The apostle has no particular respect by a "fault" to schisms in the church, or to any errors or heresies in doctrine, though the restoration of such in meekness should be endeavoured; but rather to immorality in life and conversation, and indeed to any of the works of the flesh mentioned in the preceding chapter; and especially he means any "fall" of professors, as the word used signifies, into sin, through inadvertency and want of care and watchfulness, in distinction from a wilful, obstinate, and continued course of sinning; and intends not any man in the world, for those that are without, churches and members of churches have nothing to do with in a church way; but any man that is a brother, a church member, that stands in such a relation to them, when he falls into sin, is to be taken notice of by them. And so the Syriac version reads, "any one of you"; as does one of Stephens's copies. <p>Ye that are spiritual; meaning not such who had greater spiritual gifts than others, their ministers, pastors, and ecclesiastical governors, though these may be so called; and to them it belongs to reprove and rebuke, recover and restore backsliders, which they should do in gentleness and meekness; but the apostle here addresses the brethren in general, the several members of the church, even all but those that were fallen: nor does he mean such as have more spiritual knowledge than others, in opposition to babes; nor regenerate persons, and such as had the Spirit of God, in distinction from carnal men; but such as live and walk in the Spirit, and are strong, and stand by the power and grace of the Spirit of God, as opposed to the weak, and who were fallen through the prevalency of the flesh, and force of temptation; whose duty it is, and on whom it lies, to <p>restore such an one, that is overtaken and fallen. The allusion is to the setting of bones that are broken, or out of joint, which is done with great care and tenderness. Professors fallen into sin are like broken and dislocated bones; they are out of their place, and lose both their comfort and usefulness, and are to be restored by gently telling them of their faults, and mildly reproving them for them; and when sensible of them, and troubled for them, by speaking comfortably to them, and by bringing them again, and resettling them in their former place in the church, and restoring them to their former usefulness and good conduct: and which is to be done <p>in the spirit of meekness: in the exercise of that grace which is a gift and fruit of the Spirit of God; or with a meek and humble spirit, not bearing hard upon them, and treating them in a supercilious and haughty manner, upbraiding them with their faults, aggravating them, and using them roughly, and with sharpness, which in some cases is necessary, but not in this: <p>considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted: a spiritual man should consider himself as in the body, and as carrying about with him a body of sin, a corrupt and treacherous heart, that is full of deceitful lusts, by which he may be tempted also, and drawn away and enticed; and as being liable to the temptations of Satan, and of being overcome by; them, against which he should watch and pray; and should think with himself what he would choose, and should desire to be done to him in such a case, and do the like to others that are in it. This is a reason enforcing the exhortation; and indeed almost every word in the text carries an argument engaging to it. The relation the saints stand in to one another, as "brethren", should excite them to seek each other's welfare, and to restore any that are fallen, and to abstain from all roughness and severity. The persons addressed are "spiritual", and therefore should behave as such as have the fruits of the Spirit, and, among the rest that of meekness; and, since they are strong, should help the weak, and raise up the fallen: the persons recommended to them, as the objects of their pity, care, and concern, are not such who have given up themselves to sin, but are circumvented by it, and "overtaken" in it, suddenly, and at unawares. And besides, are men, frail sinful men, liable to sin, encompassed with infirmities, and exposed to snares and temptations, which are common to human nature, and therefore should be used gently and tenderly: The apostle having given an enumeration in the foregoing chapter, of the works of the flesh, and fruits of the Spirit, directs such as are in the exercise of the latter, how to behave towards those that fall into the commission of any of the former, which may be expected, since there is flesh as well as spirit in the best. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Brethren, <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> if a man be <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> overtaken in a fault, ye which are <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> spiritual, <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> restore such an one in the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> spirit of meekness; <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span><p>(1) He condemns persistent and pressing harshness, because brotherly reprehensions ought to be moderated and tempered by the spirit of meekness.<p>(a) Through the malice of the flesh and the devil.<p>(b) Who are upheld by the power of God's Spirit.<p>(c) Labour to fill up that which is lacking in him.<p>(d) This is a metaphor which the Hebrews use, showing by this that all good gifts come from God.<p>(2) He touches the problem, for they are commonly the most severe judges who forget their own weaknesses.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>.

But <span class="ital">this</span> relation of time was so obvious of itself, that it would have been strange thus to express it. Hofmann interprets not more aptly: “<span class="ital">ere he repents of the sin;</span>” as if this idea could only be thus mentally supplied!

The last verse protested against unbrotherly tempers; this appeal presents, by way of contrast, the claims of brotherly love even in the case of real wrongdoing.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ προλημφθῇ</span>. The English version <span class="ital">overtaken</span> suggests the idea of sudden temptation, and so tends to palliate the guilt of the offender, but the Greek denotes rather his surprise in the very act, and so lays stress on the reality of his guilt. The passage is urging the tender treatment of actual offenders, and the preceding <span class="greekheb">καί</span> enforces the claims even of guilty brethren on Christian charity: “Brethren, if a man be actually detected … deal tenderly with him in a spirit of meekness.”—<span class="greekheb">καταρτίζετε</span>. This verb denotes sometimes the original framing of a mechanism (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, of the human body and of the universe in <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>), but more often its readjustment (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the setting of a broken limb, or the mending of nets in <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>). Here it indicates the correction of an offender with a view to his restoration; and the need of meekness and forbearance for the due execution of this delicate task is enforced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The transition from the plural <span class="greekheb">καταπτίζετε</span> to the singular <span class="greekheb">σκοπῶν</span> is instructive. The treatment of offenders belonged to the Church collectively, but each member needed to examine himself individually, in order that he might fulfil his part with due humility and sympathy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Brethren</span>] The force of this word of appeal (as well as the general connexion) is weakened by the division of the Epistle into chapters. The previous chapter concludes with a warning against provocation and envy—sins utterly inconsistent with Christian <span class="ital">brotherhood</span>. We are reminded of the remonstrance of Moses, ‘Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?’ <a href="/acts/7-26.htm" title="And the next day he showed himself to them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brothers; why do you wrong one to another?">Acts 7:26</a>. The train of thought seems to be: “I have condemned the unchristian spirit and conduct which you exhibit in cases where it is possible that you may be mistaken as to the gravity or the reality of the fault which you attack. I go further. Suppose a man to be detected in an overt violation of the law of God, a ‘manifest’ sin (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>): you are not even then justified in trying to crush the offender. He is your brother. You share his fallen nature; you are exposed to the same temptations as he. Let this thought lead to the exercise of a spirit of gentleness, and seek to restore such an one, to repair his fault, to recover him to the position he had forfeited”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if a man … fault</span>] In the Gk. ‘<span class="bld">even though a man be</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">overtaken</span>] ‘<span class="bld">surprised, detected</span>’. It has been suggested that the reference is to some <span class="ital">previous</span> offence, the repetition of which would of course aggravate the guilt of the individual and might seem to justify harsh treatment of him. That such is the literal sense of the word rendered ‘be overtaken’, and that it is so used in Classical Greek, is true. But there is authority for the other rendering which better suits the context. The reference is not to the habitual or repeated offender, but to the case of one who by reason of the frailty of human nature had fallen into the commission of open sin. Such an one was the incestuous person at Corinth. The incident had recently occurred, when this Epistle was written, and could not fail to be in the thoughts of the Apostle. The language used by him in reference to it (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many....">2 Corinthians 2:6-8</a>) should be compared with that of this verse. Paley (<span class="ital">Horœ Paulinœ</span>) sees here an undesigned coincidence, confirming the genuineness of both Epistles. He does not, however, notice the application of the expression ‘in a spirit of meekness’ both here and in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>, to the treatment of an offender.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye which are spiritual</span>] Surely there is no irony here, as some suggest. St Paul is full of the great distinction—not always discernible by human eyes—between those who are <span class="ital">carnal</span> and those who are <span class="ital">spiritual</span>—a distinction based on the <span class="ital">contrariety</span> (ch. <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>) between the <span class="ital">spirit</span> and the <span class="ital">flesh</span>. There is a very solemn question suggested by it—Were they what they professed to be? If they possessed the spirit of Christ, they could not but produce the fruit of the Spirit—of which gentleness, or meekness, is one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">restore</span>] The original of this word is used in a <span class="ital">physical</span> sense of repairing broken nets, <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>, of the gradual completion or furnishing of the material creation, <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>. But it is more commonly employed in N. T. in a figurative sense, see <a href="/luke/6-14.htm" title="Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,">Luke 6:14</a>, where it is rendered “when he is perfected” R.V., and <a href="/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Hebrews 13:21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1 Peter 5:10</a>. In this last passage, as elsewhere, God is the author of this work of spiritual restoration and perfecting: but He employs human agency for its accomplishment—the agency of His Church, ministers and laymen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">such a one</span>] not the habitual offender, but the fallen brother. Evangelical ethics lend no countenance to sin: they teach us to prevent further evil by the restoration of the offender. This cannot be effected by harshness of speech or bitterness of tone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the spirit of meekness</span>] Contrasted by St Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>, with the ‘rod’; the spirit which should animate every Christian as distinguished from the judicial authority vested by Christ in the Apostles and rulers of the Church. This <span class="ital">spirit</span> is produced by the Holy Ghost, but the word is not used here in a <span class="ital">personal</span> sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">considering thyself</span>] The transition from the plural, ‘<span class="ital">ye</span> which are spiritual’, to the singular, ‘thyself’, ‘thou’, gives point to the admonition. The possibility of a similar temptation and a similar fall, may well temper their judgment with self-distrust, and so, with charity. There is, however, a distinct injunction to ‘consider themselves’, to observe carefully their own spirit and conduct, lest if their eyes be fixed not on their own goings, but exclusively on those of their brother, the Tempter seize the occasion to attack and overthrow them. Some expositors make these words, ‘considering thyself, &c.’ the commencement of <span class="ital"><a href="/galatians/6-2.htm" title="Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.">Galatians 6:2</a></span>.

But <a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13, 17</a> suffice to show that its occurrence at the beginning of a sentence does not necessarily indicate the commencement of a new section of discourse - to which notion we, perhaps. owe the division of chapters here made. In fact, this paragraph is most closely connected with the preceding; the apostle's object being to point out that not even a moral delinquency into which a brother has fallen should lead us to indulge ourselves in any feeling of superiority in dealing with him, or to vaunt even to our own selves (see ver. 4) our greater consistency. In short, he is enforcing by a strong instance the exhortation in ver. 26, "Let us not be vain-glorious." "If even a man hath been overtaken." The apostle supposes the case as one which might very well present itself; the form of expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>), however, not pointing to such a case having already occurred. How possible the supposed case was, was plain enough from the enumeration of the "works of the flesh" above given, so many and so multiform. Some critics have embarrassed themselves by supposing that the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> ("even") must, Of course, emphasize the first succeeding word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>, "hath been overtaken." But it may just as probably be meant to emphasize the whole clause, "a man hath been overtaken in some trespass." This is proved by a number of other instances: thus: <a href="/luke/11-8.htm">Luke 11:8</a>, "if (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) even he will not give them unto him because he is a friend;" <a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>. "but if even thou art able to become free;" <a href="/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-6.htm">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> occurs besides in the New Testament in <a href="/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>, "she hath come beforehand to anoint ['or, 'she hath anticipated the anointing of "my body;" and <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>, "taketh before other his own supper." A more helpful illustration, however, is furnished by Wisd. 17:17, where, speaking of the horrible darkness falling quite suddenly upon the Egyptians, the writer says, "Whether he were husbandman or shepherd or labourer in the field, he was overtaken and endured (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) the ill-avoidable necessity;" the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in the compound verb meaning before he could help himself in any way. So here, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc0;&#x1fbe;</span> means be surprised, overtaken, before he' is well aware what it really is that he is doing. "Surprised;" but by whom or what? Not by a person detecting the offender in the very act; as if it were equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span> (<a href="/john/8-4.htm">John 8:4</a>); for the apostle is not at all concerned with the <span class="accented">evidence</span> for the delinquency, which is the important consideration in <a href="/john/8-4.htm">John 8:4</a>, but simply with the <span class="accented">fact.</span> Rather, overtaken by the force of temptation; as the verb "<span class="accented">taken"</span> is used with "temptation" in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; hence the words which follow," lest thou also be tempted." The writer thus commends the delinquent to sympathetic commiseration. But there is no palliation indicated by the word "fault" or "trespass." Not once in the fifteen other passages in the New Testament in which the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs is there any token of such palliation being intended. The petition, "forgive us our trespasses," is sufficient to exemplify  this statement. The trespass may be nothing less than one of the works of the flesh before specified. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> - "in," not "by" - points to the unhappy condition in which the delinquent is supposed to be, out of which it is the business of Christian charity to extricate him. Compare the expressions, "die in your sins;" "dead in trespasses;" and the imagery of a "snare of the devil," in <a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Ye which are spiritual, restore such a one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The apostle intimates that the business of recovering a fallen brother is one which those Christians are not qualified to undertake who, by reason of the strong tincture of the flesh still existing in their moral character, may themselves be justly styled "carnal" (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3</a>. D. Putting as it were such persons on one side, the apostle summons to the work those in whom the Spirit hath gained so marked an ascendancy that, compared with the generality of Christians, they may be classed as "spiritual." It was incumbent on such (he says) not to stand aloof, as if it were not their concern, or as ff the delinquent were to be treated as an enemy or outcast (comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>), far less to indulge themselves in taking pleasure in his inconsistency as illustrating their own spirituality, but to come forward to his assistance. Others, who might justly feel less qualified to act in the case themselves, might, however, take from the apostle's direction the hint that at least they should lend their sympathy to the work of their more capable brethren, desire and pray for their erring brother's recovery, and not exult over his fault. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to make a thing fit, even, just that which it properly should be," is used in <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a> of repairing nets; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a> of a Christian community restored to its proper condition of unanimity; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a> of making good any lacking of faith. It is used also (Liddel; and Scott) of setting a broken limb. But there is nothing to show that the apostle has any one particular image of disorder in view. The present tense of the imperative seems to mean, "apply yourselves to restore him;" the actual achievement (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) may not be in their power, <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit of</span> <span class="cmt_word">meekness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">in a spirit of meekness.</span> We have the same phrase in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>, "Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?' The term "spirit" seems as it were to hover between the sense of the Holy Spirit and of that particular condition of our own spirit which is produced by his influence (compare "spirit of adoption," <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>). But the latter seems here the one more immediately intended. It is not identical, however, with the phrase, "meek spirit," which we have in <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>. The meekness or tenderness meant is that of one who, humbly conscious of human infirmity in general, his own infirmity included, is prepared to be very considerate and gentle towards the ignorant and those out of the way; loth to use the "rod." <span class="cmt_word">Considering</span> <span class="cmt_word">thyself, lest thou also be tempted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">looking to thine own self</span>, <span class="accented">lest thou also be tempted.</span> The change from the plural to the singular makes the warning more impressive and searching. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament always denotes looking intently: sometimes on something to be guarded against, as <a href="/luke/11-35.htm">Luke 11:35</a> and <a href="/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>; at other times, at something to be aimed at or imitated (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>). The former is meant here. The Christian is to be on his guard against his own weak and corrupt nature; lest he withhold help, or adequate help; lest in helping he get betrayed into the sin of Pharisaic self-righteousness - the sin of harshness, censoriousness. The clause is to be viewed in conjunction with the thought of the unceasing conflict between the flesh and the Spirit mentioned in ch. 5:17. "Tempted," so as to fall (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Overtaken in a fault (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; - &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>The verb means lit. to take before; to anticipate or forestall.

Before you deal severely with the erring brother, consider your own weakness and susceptibility to temptation, and restore him in view of that fact. </body></html>
