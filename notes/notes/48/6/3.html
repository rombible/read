So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if a man think himself to be something ... - see <a href="/galatians/5-26.htm">Galatians 5:26</a>. This is designed, evidently, to be another reason why we should be kind and tender to those who have erred. It is, that even those who are most confident may fall. They who feel secure, and think it impossible that they should sin, are not safe. They may be wholly deceived, and may be nothing, when they have the highest estimate of themselves. They may themselves fall into sin, and have need of all the sympathy and kindness of their brethren.<p>When he is nothing - When he has no strength, and no moral worth. When he is not such as he apprehends, but is lifted up with vain self-conceit.<p>He deceiveth himself - He understands not his own character.

Compare Jas 1:26, "deceiveth his own heart."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is a general maxim, and the truth of it is obvious to every one that readeth it, for supposing a man to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">nothing</span> of what he thinks himself to be, he must needs <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">deceive himself</span> in nourishing and entertaining such an opinion of himself. For the dependence of it upon what the apostle had said before, it is obvious. Pride, and men’s high opinions of themselves above what they ought, are the cause of their censoriousness and morosity in dealing with other offenders; which modesty would not suffer in them, if they apprehended themselves to be as weak, and as much exposed to temptations, as others are. It is pride and overweening opinions of ourselves, that make us despise or neglect others under their burdens, and so forget the law of Christ; the apostle therefore properly addeth this precept for humility and modesty to those former precepts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/galatians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For if a man think himself to be something,.... Of himself; to have anything of himself, to do anything of himself, and of himself to attain to life and salvation: <p>when he is nothing: of himself; not even as a creature, but owes his being and preservation, and all the mercies of life, to another, even to God; has no grace nor gifts of himself, but what he has received, and can do no good thing, not think a good thought, or perform a good action, of himself, and much less of himself procure eternal life and salvation: <p>he deceiveth himself: and will find himself sadly mistaken, and wretchedly disappointed another day; or whoever thinks himself to be some famous and excellent person, to be something more, and better than others, of a more excellent nature, and of greater abilities, that he is free from sin, or at least holier than others, and not liable to fall as others, whom he looks upon with disdain and contempt, wanting that charity which the law, and new commandment of Christ, requires, when he is nothing but sin and vanity, he is destitute of the grace of God, he deceives himself and the truth is not in him. This the apostle says to depress pride, and a swelling conceit of themselves, and all uncharitable, rough, and severe usages of others. A saying like this the Jews have (y); <p>"whoever he is that is something, or thinks in himself that he is  "something", it would be better for him if he had never been created.'' <p>(y) Midrash Kohelet, fol. 79. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/galatians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/galatians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/galatians/6-3.htm" title="For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.">Galatians 6:3</a>. <span class="ital">Argumentum e contrario</span> for the preceding <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὕτως ἀναπληρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>.; in so far as the fulfilment to be given <span class="ital">in such measure</span> to this law is impossible to moral conceit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For if any one thinks himself to be something</span>, imagines himself possessed of peculiar moral worth, so that he conceives himself exalted above such a mutual bearing of burdens, <span class="ital">while he is nothing</span>, although he is in reality of no moral importance, <span class="ital">he is</span>, so far from fulfilling the law of Christ, <span class="ital">involved in self-deception</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">εἶναί τι</span>, and the opposite <span class="greekheb">μηδὲν εἶναι</span>, <span class="ital">nullius momenti esse</span> (comp.

The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, is well illustrated by the passage cited by critics from Plato's 'Apologia,' p. 41, E: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,...  <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> "Something" is, by a common meiosis, put for "something considerable" (cf. <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>). The especial form of eminence, the claim to which is here referred to, is eminence in spirituality and consistency as a servant of Christ. Possibly the apostle has in his eye certain individuals among the Galatians that he had heard of, who, professing much, were, however, self-complacently bitter and contemptuous towards brethren who had gone wrong in moral conduct or who differed from themselves in the disputes then rife in those Churches. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, "being nothing," is a part of the hypothesis relative to the individual case spoken of, not a statement putting forth the aphorism that no one is really anything. The passage quoted above from Plato shows, that in the latter case we should have had <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>. Some men, by the grace of God, <span class="accented">are</span> "something;" but these persons only fancy themselves to be so. Whether any man is really "something" or not is determined by his practical conduct - his "work" as the apostle expresses it in the next verse. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here, though we have the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, deceivers, in <a href="/titus/1-10.htm">Titus 1:10</a>. St. James (<a href="/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>) speaks of a man "deceiving his heart ' in seemingly just the same sense. In both passages it appears to be meant that a man palms off upon his own mind fancies as if they were just apprehensions of real facts; in both also these fancies are but illusive notions of one's own religious character - here, as being "spiritual;" in James, as being "religious" or "devout" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">- the</span> activity of practical benevolence being in both cases wanting; for "<span class="accented">the</span> bridling not his tongue" in ver. 26 is proved by the contrasted behaviour spoken of in the next verse to refer to those <span class="accented">sins</span> of the tongue which are implicitly condemned in vers. 19-21. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Think (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>Sometimes rendered seems, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-9.htm">2 Corinthians 10:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; but think is Paul's usual meaning.
