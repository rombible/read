Having accepted Christ Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, and relying on him alone for justification and salvation, they become the sons of God. But no outward forms or profession can secure these blessings; for if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. In baptism we put on Christ; therein we profess to be his disciples. Being baptized into Christ, we are baptized into his death, that as he died and rose again, so we should die unto sin, and walk in newness and holiness of life. The putting on of Christ according to the gospel, consists not in outward imitation, but in a new birth, an entire change. He who makes believers to be heirs, will provide for them. Therefore our care must be to do the duties that belong to us, and all other cares we must cast upon God. And our special care must be for heaven; the things of this life are but trifles. The city of God in heaven, is the portion or child's part. Seek to be sure of that above all things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For ye are all the children of God ... - All who bear the Christian name - the converts from among the Jews and Gentiles alike; see the note at <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>. The idea here is, that they are no longer under tutors and governors; they are no longer subject to the direction and will of the "paedagogus"; they are arrived at age, and are admitted to the privileges of sons; see the note at <a href="/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>. The language here is derived from the fact, that until the son arrived at age, he was in many respects not different from a servant. He was under laws and restraints; and subject to the will of another. When of age, he entered on the privileges of heirship, and was free to act for himself. Thus, under the Law, people were under restraints, and subject to heavy exactions. Under the gospel, they are free, and admitted to the privileges of the sons of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. children&#8212;Greek, "sons."<p>by&#8212;Greek, "through faith."

To be a son <span class="ital">of God</span> through <span class="ital">faith</span>, and to be under the old <span class="ital">tutorial training</span>, are contradictory relations, one of which excludes the other.

It suggests and leads up to the grand revelation of Gospel blessedness contained in the peroration to this chapter. The very fact that we were under tutelage proves that our true relation to God is that of sons, a relationship into which we all, both Jews and Gentiles, entered by believing in Jesus Christ. Of this relationship our Baptism was the sign and pledge and instrument. We therein became clothed with Christ. Our nakedness was covered with the robe of His perfect righteousness. He became the circumambient, enveloping element in which our new life is lived and sustained. And here the external distinctions, of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, nay, even that which has so long separated the sexes, disappears. In Christ <span class="ital">all</span> are united who by faith are united to Him.

"For;" that is, what is just affirmed (ver. 25) is true, because ye are "sons" and no longer "children." "Ye are;" in ver. 25 it is "we are." The whole course of the argument, however, shows that the persons recited by each of the personal pronouns are in effect the same, namely, the people of God; otherwise this verse would not furnish proof, as by the "for" it professes to do, of the statement of ver. 25. The change from "we" to "ye" has by some been explained as due to the writer's wish to preclude the supposition that the "we' in ver. 25 applied to Jewish believers only. A more satisfactory explanation is that he wishes to give the statement in vers. 22-25, which is general, a more trenchant force as applying to those whose spiritual difficulties he is now dealing with. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:5</a>, "Ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness," we have the converse transition. There likewise the persons recited are in effect the same; and the change of person in the pronoun, making the discourse, from exhortation addressed to others, pass into a form of cohortation applying to all Christians alike, including the writer himself, is dictated by the apostle's sympathetic kindness for especially his Thessalonian converts. "Ye are." The fact that faith is the sole and sufficient ground of qualification eliminates all those distinctions by which the Law has heretofore fenced off Gentiles, pronouncing them "separated as aliens," "strangers to the covenants," and "without God" (cf. <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>). In the sequel (ver. 28) the apostle passes on from the thought of this particular outward distinction of Jew and Gentile to the thought of all other purely external distinctions. "In Christ Jesus." It is debated whether this clause should be connected with "faith," as if it were <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the article being omitted, as in <a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>, and often; or with the words, "ye are sons of God," with a comma following the word "faith." Both modes of construing find in the sentence at last the same contents of thought; for each of the two propositions thus severally formed contains by implication the other. It probably suits the connection best to take the apostle as at once affirming that it is in Christ Jesus that we are God's sons through faith, rather than as leaving this to be inferred from the fact of our being sons through faith in Christ. "In Christ" is, with St. Paul, a very favourite form of indicating the channel through which the great blessings of the gospel are realized (cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3, 6, 7, 11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6, 7, 10, 13, 21, 22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>, etc.). "Sons of God." It is quite clear that the term "sons" (<span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) denotes those who have come into the full enjoyment, so far as the present life is concerned, of the position Which their birth had entitled them to; and that it stands in contrast with their earlier position when children in years under a <span class="accented">paedagogus.</span> The noun <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, son, itself, however, while it is never used as synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to describe one as a child in years, yet, like <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, child, does not ordinarily betoken more than simple relationship as the correlative with "father;" for which reason <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is used in such phrases as "children of disobedience," "of Israel," of light," "of the day," "of the devil," "of perdition." In <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-8</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is applied in the case of one who is as yet under the discipline of the rod; but even there <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> of itself immediately designates his filial relation only. St. Paul never uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> at all, though he has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a> for children in years, in place of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> which he ordinarily employs (<a href="/romans/2-20.htm">Romans 2:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-13.htm">Hebrews 5:13</a>), and which we find presently after in vers. I and 3 of the next chapter. The particular modification of meaning in which the apostle here uses the term is justified by the consideration which he presently puts forward, that a son of even an opulent or high-born parent, while a mere child, possesses no more freedom than if he were the child of any other person; his heirship or distinction of birth is for so long more or less veiled; it is not until he passes out of his nonage that he appears in his proper character. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For ye are all the children of God (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#768;)<p>Better, ye are all sons of God. Note 1. The change of person, ye are. Comp. we, our, us, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-25.htm">Galatians 3:25</a>. He now addresses the Galatians, who were mostly Gentiles, and includes all Christians, Jewish and Gentile. 2. The emphasis is on sons of God rather than on all; for his object is to show that, after the coming of faith, they are no more under the care of a guardian. &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; signifies sons of full age (comp. <a href="/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>) who have outgrown the surveillance of the guardian; so that sons is emphasized as against children. Paul describes Christians both as &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; children of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>, <a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>), and &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; sons of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>, <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>; <a href="/romans/9-26.htm">Romans 9:26</a>). Both &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; signify a relation based on parentage. The common distinction between &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; as emphasizing natural relationship, and &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; as marking legal or ethical status, should not be pressed. In lxx both words are applied ethically to Israel as God's beloved people. See <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; Wisd. 16:21; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>; and <a href="/isaiah/63-6.htm">Isaiah 63:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; Wisd. 9:7; 12:19. John never uses &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; to describe the relation of Christians to God; but he attaches both the ethical relation and that of conferred privilege, as well as that of birth, to &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. See <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>, <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>; <a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="/john/3-7.htm">John 3:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18</a>. Paul often regards the Christian relation from a legal point of view as &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; adoption, a word used only by him. See <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, we have both &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; and &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, and both in the ethical sense.

The article before &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; faith may point back to the faith previously mentioned, or may have, as so often, a possessive force, your faith. </body></html>
