This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said to foresee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture did foresee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it is only in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us then study the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who can in any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is against all sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and are become guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Those only are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is only through faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see that justification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the church of God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the only way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Though deliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open to escape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being made sin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment. The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners to flee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for how can God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared not his own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time, Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Scripture - The word Scripture refers to the Old Testament; see the note at <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>. It is here personified, or spoken of as foreseeing. The idea is, that he by whom the scriptures were inspired, foresaw that. It is agreeable, the meaning is, to the account on the subject in the Old Testament. The Syriac renders this, "Since God foreknew that the Gentiles would be justified by faith, he before announced to Abraham, as the scripture saith, In thee shall all nations be blessed."<p>Foreseeing - That is, this doctrine is contained in the Old Testament. It was foreseen and predicted that the pagan would be justified by faith, and not by the works of the Law.<p>That God would justify the heathen - Greek: "The nations" - &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  ta ethne&#772; - the Gentiles. The fact that the pagan, or the Gentiles would be admitted to the privileges of the true religion, and be interested in the benefits of the coming of the Messiah, is a fact which is everywhere abundantly predicted in the Old Testament. As an instance, see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22-23</a>; 60. I do not know that it is anywhere distinctly foretold that the pagan would be justified by faith, nor does the argument of the apostle require us to believe this. He says that the Scriptures, that is, he who inspired the Scriptures, foresaw that fact, and that the Scriptures were written as if with the knowledge of that fact; but it is not directly affirmed. The whole structure and frame of the Old Testament, however, proceeds on the supposition that it would be so; and this is all that the declaration of the apostle requires us to understand,<p>Preached before the gospel - This translation does not convey quite the idea to us, which the language of Paul, in the original, would to the people to whom he addressed it. We have affixed a technical sense to the phrase "to preach the gospel." It is applied to the formal and public annunciation of the truths of religion, especially the "good news" of a Saviour's birth, and of redemption by his blood. But we are not required by the language used here to suppose that this was done to Abraham, or that "the gospel" was preached to him in the sense in which we all now use that phrase. The expression, in Greek &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  proeue&#772;ngelisato, means merely, "the joyful news was announced beforehand to Abraham;" scil. that in him should all the nations of the earth be blessed. It was implied, indeed, that it would be by the Messiah; but the distinct point of the "good news" was not the "gospel" as we understand it, but it was that somehow through him all the nations of the earth would be made happy. Tyndale has well translated it," Showed beforehand glad tidings unto Abraham." This translation should have been adopted in our common version.<p>In thee shall all nations be blessed - See the <a href="/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a> note; <a href="/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a> note. All nations should be made happy in him, or through him. The sense is, that the Messiah was to be descended from him, and the religion of the Messiah, producing peace and salvation, was to be extended to all the nations of the earth: see <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; compare the note at <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>.<p>&#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  Euangelizo&#772; doubtless here, as elsewhere, signifies to announce glad tidings. And in all the passages where this word occurs, even in those where the author might be disposed to allow that the "gospel technically" was meant, the translation which he proposes here would be very suitable and exact. It was certainly the same gospel that was preached to Abraham, that is now preached to us, though not with, the same fulness of revelation, in his case. The apostle here affirms that the gospel, that is, the way of justification through Christ, in opposition to the legal system he had been condemning - was, in few words, preached to Abraham, being contained in that promise, "in thee shall all nations be blessed;" see <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>. The full meaning of the promise, indeed, could not be gathered from the words themselves, but Abraham must have understood their application in a far more extensive sense than that "somehow through him all the nations of the earth would be made happy." Whether the true import were made known to him directly by the Spirit of God, or discerned by him in typical representation, it is certain that Abraham's faith terminated on the promised Seed, that is, Christ whose day he desired to see, and seeing it afar, was glad, <a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>. "Hereof it followeth," says Luther on the place, "that the blessing and faith of Abraham is the same that ours is, that Abraham's Christ is our Christ, that Christ died as well for the sins of Abraham as for us.") <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/galatians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

For the "promise" was substantially the Gospel by anticipation. Compare Joh 8:56; Heb 4:2. A proof that "the old fathers did not look only for transitory promises" [Article VII, Church of England]. Thus the Gospel, in its essential germ, is older than the law though the full development of the former is subsequent to the latter.<p>In thee&#8212;not "in thy seed," which is a point not here raised; but strictly "in thee," as followers of thy faith, it having first shown the way to justification before God [Alford]; or "in thee," as Father of the promised seed, namely, Christ (Ga 3:16), who is the Object of faith (Ge 22:18; Ps 72:17), and imitating thy faith (see on [2340]Ga 3:9).<p>all nations&#8212;or as above, "all the Gentiles" (Ge 12:3; 18:18; 22:18).<p>be blessed&#8212;an act of grace, not something earned by works. The blessing of justification was to Abraham by faith in the promise, not by works. So to those who follow Abraham, the father of the faithful, the blessing, that is, justification, comes purely by faith in Him who is the subject of the promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Holy Ghost in Scripture (by whose inspiration the Scripture was written) foreseeing, or knowing, the counsels and designs of God, that the heathen (when the fulness of times as to them should come) should be justified through faith in Christ, preached the same doctrine before unto Abraham; so as it is no new doctrine; the gospel which we now preach unto you, was long since revealed unto Abraham, who saw Christ’s day, and rejoiced, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a></span>.

This seems to agree with the Jewish forms or citing passages of Scripture,  , "what does the Scripture foresee?" and  , (n) "what does the law foresee?" The Scripture here, by a "prosopopeia", is represented as foreseeing an event that would come to pass, and accordingly spoke of it before hand, and designs God the author of the Scripture; and so the Syriac version renders it, "for seeing"  , "that God" foreknew, &amp;c. and means either the Holy Spirit, who searches the deep things of God, is privy to all his counsels and decrees, and to this of the justification of the Gentiles; or God the Father, who justifies the uncircumcision through faith, according to his own provision and predetermination of it, before the world was; for he was in Christ, reconciling the world, his elect among the Gentiles, from all eternity; when he resolved not to impute their sins to them, but to his Son, who engaged to be their surety: or rather the Son of God, since he was the preacher of this to Abraham; who lay in the bosom of the Father, and was not only acquainted with all his purposes and determinations, but entered into a covenant with him, for, and on the behalf of the people, the chosen ones, among the Gentiles as well as Jews; and undertook to bring in a righteousness for them, by which, being received by faith, they should evidentially, manifestly, in the court of their own consciences, be justified: wherefore the wisdom of God, the eternal Logos, having such a certain foresight, both as God and as Mediator, concerned in the covenant of grace for his people, <p>that God would justify the Heathen through faith: that is, that whereas a righteousness would be wrought out, and brought in, for the justification of all God's elect, and the doctrine of it be preached among the Gentiles, to whom faith would be given to lay hold on, and receive this righteousness, God would hereby, and hereupon pronounce the sentence of justification in the court of conscience; from whence follow peace and joy in the Holy Ghost; the Scripture, the author, and substance of it, God the Word, <p>preached before, the Gospel unto Abraham; for not to the Father or the Spirit, as to the Son, can preaching be so well ascribed: Christ was the first preacher of the Gospel that ever was; he first preached it to Adam and Eve in the garden, and afterwards to Abraham: it was Gospel, it was good news to him, that the Messiah should spring from him, and all nations be blessed in him; he rejoiced at it, and by faith saw Christ's day and was glad and particularly that part of the Gospel, and which is a principal part of it, justification by faith; and that, as it concerned the Gentiles, was preached unto him; and before his circumcision, of which that was a sign and seal, namely, that the righteousness of faith should be upon the uncircumcised Gentiles; and before the law of works was given on Mount Sinai, and long before the doctrine of justification by faith was preached unto the Gentiles, and they enjoyed the comfort of it; which shows this to be the Gospel, and to be no new doctrine, nor different from what was so early taught; the sum and substance of which lies in these words, "in thee shall all nations be blessed"; the passage referred to, is in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> and is repeated <a href="/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a> and in  <p><a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a> is thus expressed, <p>in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; which shows, that this is not to be understood of Abraham personally, but of his seed; and which cannot intend Isaac, the immediate seed of Abraham, in whom it was never verified; and besides, is carried down to his seed, <a href="/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a> as not terminating in him; and for the same reason it cannot design Jacob, the immediate seed of Isaac; see <a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a> nor the whole body of the Jews, the posterity of Jacob, in whom it never had its completion; for when and how have the nations of the earth been blessed in them? either whilst in their own land, when they would have no conversation with them, neither on a civil or sacred account, unless they conformed to their rites; or since their dispersion, so far from it, that their name is used by way of reproach, and as a proverb, a taunt, and a curse everywhere; but it is to be understood of the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the son of Abraham, took upon him the seed of Abraham, and to whom it is applied, <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a> as by the Apostle Peter, <a href="/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>. The phrase being "blessed in" him, does not signify a blessing of themselves or others, or a proverbial expression that should be used among the Gentiles, "God bless thee as Abraham, or the God of Abraham bless thee, or God bless you as he did the Israelites, or seed of Abraham"; for no one instance can be produced of the nations of the world ever using such a form of blessing; no history, sacred or profane, makes mention that these, or any other Jewish forms of blessing, were ever used among the Gentiles: but here it designs blessings in Christ, and not temporal, but spiritual ones, even all spiritual blessings; as redemption, reconciliation, peace, pardon, adoption, sanctification, and eternal life, and particularly justification; this is the blessedness more especially intended, which comes not upon the circumcision only, but the uncircumcision also; and they that partake of this are blessed indeed; for they are justified from all sin, are free from condemnation, secure from the wrath of God, have a title to eternal life, and shall certainly be glorified: and when it is said that "all nations" shall be thus blessed, the meaning is, not that every individual of all nations shall enjoy this happiness, for all are not in Christ, nor have his righteousness imputed to them, nor have faith in him, there are many that will be condemned with the world; but some of all nations, that God will have saved, and Christ has redeemed by his blood; and these are the many he justifies, even all the elect of God, in the various nations of the world. <p>(n) Bemidbar Rabba, Parash. 10. fol. 201. 4.

Hence (and see <a href="/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>) it is not to be explained (with Winer, Matthias, Schott, Baumgarten-Crusius, following earlier expositors) of all nations, both Jews and Gentiles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The emphasis in this utterance of promise is to be laid, not on <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> (Schott), but on the prefixed <span class="greekheb">ἐνευλογηθήσονται</span>.

The characteristic <span class="greekheb">ἐνευλογ</span>. can only be meant to apply to those who are of faith, and not to those who are of the law.

Bähr (in <span class="ital">Stud. u.

After having pointed out from the Scripture that none other than believers are <span class="ital">sons</span> of Abraham, Paul now shows further according to Scripture that none other than these have a share in Abraham’s <span class="ital">blessing</span>, that is, <span class="ital">are justified</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/galatians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/galatians/3-8.htm" title="And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.">Galatians 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῖ</span>: <span class="ital">justifieth</span>. The present tense is used because justification by faith, though not revealed to the Gentiles till Christ came, was an eternal truth of God’s dealings with man, to be revealed in due time. There were in Genesis anticipations of this truth, and Abraham himself, the father of the faithful, was a kind of firstfruits of the Gentiles (<a href="/context/romans/4-10.htm" title="How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?

St Paul’s appeal here and elsewhere to the authority of the O.T. as the unerring, irreversible decision is very instructive. This authority depends on an inspiration which is <span class="ital">verbal</span>, though not <span class="ital">mechanical</span>. The quotation combines a reference to two distinct promises, that in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>, “And in thee shall the tribes of the earth be blessed”; and in <a href="/genesis/18-18.htm" title="Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?">Genesis 18:18</a>, “And all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him”. The true seed (children) of Abraham are ‘they which are of faith’—not his natural descendants, as such, but all who, whether Jews or Gentiles, “walk in the footsteps of the faith which Abraham had in uncircumcision”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the scripture, foreseeing</span>] The Scripture is here personified, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/galatians/3-22.htm" title="But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.">Galatians 3:22</a></span>. It of course means the Holy Ghost, by Whose inspiration the passage was written. In the Epistle to the Hebrews the usual formula is, ‘As the Holy Ghost saith’. Such forms of expression as ‘the Scripture said’, were common in the Rabbinic writers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The connexion of this verse with what precedes is this:—Abraham was justified by faith, and they who are of faith are his children.

This announcement was made <span class="ital">before</span>, ‘a Gospel before Gospel times’, Bengel. Others explain it a Gospel antecedent not only to the Law, but to the institution of circumcision, <a href="/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in thee</span>] This is supposed by some to mean “as their spiritual progenitor”. Of course there is no reference to a transmitted and inherited faith. Dr Jowett’s explanation is undoubtedly right, “in thee, by anticipation”, that is, “as the progenitor of the Messiah” (Bengel). The blessing (justification) comes to man only from the atoning death and imputed merit of Christ. It was apprehended by faith in the case of Abraham; it is so apprehended by each one of his spiritual descendants. Thus, <span class="ital"><a href="/galatians/3-9.htm" title="So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.">Galatians 3:9</a></span>, they that are of faith (note <span class="ital"><a href="/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a></span>) are blessed <span class="ital">with</span> faithful Abraham.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/galatians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/galatians/3-8.htm" title="And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.">Galatians 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προιδοῦσα δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span> [<span class="ital">and moreover</span>] <span class="ital">foreseeing</span>) <span class="greekheb">Δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span> [<span class="ital">and moreover</span>] being an emphatic addition (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιτατικὸν</span>), extends the force of the argument to the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> also. The term <span class="ital">foreseeing</span> implies divine <span class="ital">foreknowledge</span>, more ancient than the law. The great excellence of sacred Scripture is, that all the points likely to be controverted are foreseen and decided in it, even in the most appropriate language.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφὴ</span>, <span class="ital">scripture</span>) A mode of expression abbreviated and condensed in a manifold degree, as will be evident to him who evolves the ideas involved in it, thus; it is God who has given testimony to these things; God foreknew that He would act in this manner with the Gentiles; God therefore already at that time acted in a similar manner with Abraham; God also caused it to be consigned to writing, and that too when at the time that it was written, it was still future. All these things are included in that expression, <span class="ital">foreseeing</span> —— All these ideas could not be so briefly expressed in our mode of speaking, otherwise [or if they could] they might be considered obscure. But the ardour of the apostle’s mind, which, being filled with the Spirit, was directed to one topic, and that too of principal importance, produces this effect [the combination of great brevity with freedom from obscurity]. What was spoken to <span class="ital">Abraham</span>, was written out in the time of <span class="ital">Moses</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστεως</span>, <span class="ital">by faith</span>) <span class="ital">not</span> <span class="ital">by works</span>.—<span class="greekheb">δικαιοῖ</span>, <span class="ital">justifies</span> [instead of <span class="ital">would justify</span>]) The present, in respect of Paul then writing; so, <span class="ital">they have the blessing</span> [<span class="ital">are blessed</span>, <span class="greekheb">εὐλογοῦνται</span>], <a href="/galatians/3-9.htm" title="So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.">Galatians 3:9</a>.—<span class="greekheb">προευηγγελίσατο</span>, <span class="ital">preached the Gospel before</span>) A word, which very sweetly approaches to a Catachresis.[22] The <span class="ital">Gospel was preached to Abraham before</span> the times of the Gospel.

There is the mere promise of blessing; nothing is said as to works. Moreover, justification and blessing are conjoined. At the same time the nature of faith is evident from the form of the Hebrew verb: <span class="ital">they shall bless themselves</span>, they shall congratulate themselves regarding the blessing. <a href="/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>; comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΣΟῚ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">in thee</span>) as in the father of the Messiah; therefore much more in Messiah [Himself].

The word "Scripture" in <a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a>, "no prophecy of Scripture," certainly denotes the sacred writings as taken collectively, that is, what is frequently recited by the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, "the Scriptures." So probably in <a href="/acts/8-22.htm">Acts 8:22</a>, "the passage of Scripture." We are, therefore, war, anted in supposing it possible, and being possible it is here also probable, that this is the sense in which the apostle now uses the term as well as in ver. 22, rather than as denoting, either the one particular passage cited or the particular book out of which it is taken. This view better suits the personification under which the Old Testament is here presented. This personification groups with that in <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>, "The Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up." In both  cases the "Scripture" is put in place of the announcement which Scripture records as having been made, the Scripture itself being written after the time of both Abraham and Pharaoh, and not addressed to them. But here there is the additional feature, of foresight being attributed to Scripture - a foresight, net exactly of the Holy Spirit inspiring the Scripture, but of the Divine Being who, on the occasion referred to, was holding communication with Abraham; although, yet again, "the Scripture" seems in the words, "foreseeing that God would justify," etc., distinguished from "God." The sense, however, is clear; Scripture shows that, as early as the time of Abraham, a Divine intimation was given that God would, on the ground of faith simply, justify any human being throughout the world that should believe in him as Abraham did. Rabbinical scholars tell us that in those writings a citation from Scripture is frequently introduced with the words, "What sees the Scripture?" or, "What sees he [or, 'it']?" <span class="cmt_word">That God would justify the heathen through faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">that by</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">out of</span>) <span class="accented">faith would God justify the nations.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> betokens that the apostle's point here is, not that God would justify the Gentiles, but that it was by faith that he would do so irrespectively of any fulfilment on their part of ceremonial observances. The tense of the present indicative <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span> is hardly to be explained thus: would justify as we now see he is doing. The usual effect of the <span class="accented">oratio obliqua</span> transfers the standpoint of time in <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span> to the time of the foresight, the present tense being put instead of the future (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), as intimating that God was, so to speak, even now preparing thus to justify, or, in the Divine estimate of spaces of time, was on the eve of thus justifying; analogously with the force of the present tense in the participles "given" and "poured out" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19, 20</a>. The condition of mankind in the meanwhile is described in vers. 22, 23 - shut up unto the faith that was to be revealed. A question arises as to the exact interpretation of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as twice occurring in this verse. Does the apostle use it as the correlative to Jews, "Gentiles;" or without any such sense of contradistinction, "nations" including both Jews and Gentiles? In answer, we observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The great point in these verses (6-9) is, not the call of the Gentiles, but the efficacy of faith without Levitical ceremonialism, as summed up in the words of ver. 9. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The original passage which the apostle is now referring to is that in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where the Septuagint, conformably with the Hebrew, has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>: in our Authorized Version," And in thee shall all families [Hebrew, <span class="accented">mishpechoth</span>] of the earth be blessed:" only, through some cause or other, instead of "all families," he writes the words, "all nations" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), which we find in what was said by the Lord to the two angels (<a href="/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>), <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> [that is, Abraham] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>: Authorized Version, "all the nations of the earth" (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>, and the promise to Isaac, <a href="/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>, are irrelevant to the point now under consideration). We, therefore, are warranted in assuming that, as <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="accented">might</span> be used as coextensive with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("families"), it really <span class="accented">is</span> here employed by the apostle with the same extension of application. We may add that, most certainly, the apostle utterly repudiated the notion that God justifies Gentiles on a different footing from that on which he justifies Jews: whether Jews or Gentiles, they only who are of faith are blessed with Abraham; and, whether Jews or Gentiles all who are of faith <span class="accented">are</span> blessed with him. <span class="cmt_word">Preached before the gospel unto Abraham</span>, saying (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham</span>, <span class="accented">saying.</span> Very striking and animated is the apostle's use of this word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, a compound verb, minted no doubt for the occasion out of his own ardent thought, though it is found also in his senior contemporary, Philo. It is plainly an allusion to the "gospel" now openly proclaimed to the world as having been "by anticipation" already then announced to Abraham, the Most High himself the herald; signifying also the joy which it brought to the patriarch, and (Chrysostom adds) his great desire for its accomplishment. Tim blessed and glorious gospel of the grace of God has been the thought of God in all ages. May we connect with this the mysterious passage in <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>:567 In point of construction, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is nowhere else followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>: but as it is sometimes found governing an accusative of the matter preached (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>; <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>; <a href="/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a>; <a href="/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>), there is no harshness in its construction with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which we may here represent in English by "saying." <span class="cmt_word">In thee shall all nations</span> <span class="cmt_word">be blessed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>). "In thee" as their type and pattern, in respect both to the "blessing" bestowed upon him and to the faith out of which his blessing sprang. The "blessing" consists of God's love and all the well-being which can flow from God's love; the form of well-being varying according to the believer's circumstances, whether in this life or in the life   to come; it receives its consummation with the final utterance, "Come, ye blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Into this condition of blessedness the sinful and guilty can only be brought through justification; but justification through Christ does of necessary consequence bring us into it. The compound form of the verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;</span>, added to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, forcibly indicates that moral inherency in Abraham, through our being in faith and obedience his spiritual offspring, whereby alone the blessing is attained and possessed. Chrysostom remarks, "If, then, those were Abraham's sons, not who were related to him by blood, but who follow his faith, for this is the meaning of the words, 'In thee all nations,' it is plain that the Gentiles are brought into kindred with him." Augustine explains "in thee," similarly: "To wit, by imitation of his faith by which he was justified even before the sacrament of circumcision." Luther writes "In Abraham are we blessed, but in what Abraham? The believing Abraham, to wit; because if we are not in Abraham, we are under a curse rather, even if we were in Abraham according to the flesh." Calvin likewise: "These words beyond all doubt mean that all must become objects of blessing after Abraham's fashion; for he is the common pattern, nay rather, rule. But he by faith obtained blessing; therefore faith is for all the means." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/galatians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The scripture (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768;)<p>See on <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>.
