See how craftsmen make advantage to themselves of people's superstition, and serve their worldly ends by it. Men are jealous for that by which they get their wealth; and many set themselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men from all unlawful crafts, however much wealth is to be gotten by them. There are persons who will stickle for what is most grossly absurd, unreasonable, and false; as this, that those are gods which are made with hands, if it has but worldly interest on its side. The whole city was full of confusion, the common and natural effect of zeal for false religion. Zeal for the honour of Christ, and love to the brethren, encourage zealous believers to venture into danger. Friends will often be raised up among those who are strangers to true religion, but have observed the honest and consistent behaviour of Christians.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye see and hear - You see at Ephesus, and you hear the same in other places.<p>Throughout all Asia - All Asia Minor; or perhaps the province of which Ephesus was the capital.
