Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>. Here all the facts of the case confirm the view which has there been stated. The mere power of speaking foreign languages without learning them, as other men learn, seems a much less adequate result of the new gift than that which we find in the new enthusiasm and intensity of spiritual joy, of which the gift of tongues was the natural expression. It is not without interest to remember that the discussion of the two gifts in 1 Corinthians 14, in which the connection of the “tongues” with jubilant and ecstatic praise is unmistakable (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1Corinthians 14:14-16</a>), was written not very long after this incident, and while the facts must yet have been fresh in St. Paul’s memory. On the “laying on of hands,” which was the “outward and visible sign” of the “inward and spiritual grace,” see Notes on <a href="/context/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:">Acts 8:14-18</a>, where the laying-on of hands is followed by a gift of the Holy Ghost.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-7 Paul, at Ephesus, found some religious persons, who looked to Jesus as the Messiah. They had not been led to expect the miraculous powers of the Holy Ghost, nor were they informed that the gospel was especially the ministration of the Spirit. But they spake as ready to welcome the notice of it. Paul shows them that John never design that those he baptized should rest there, but told them that they should believe on Him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. They thankfully accepted the discovery, and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. The Holy Ghost came upon them in a surprising, overpowering manner; they spake with tongues, and prophesied, as the apostles and the first Gentile coverts did. Though we do not now expect miraculous powers, yet all who profess to be disciples of Christ, should be called on to examine whether they have received the seal of the Holy Ghost, in his sanctifying influences, to the sincerity of their faith. Many seem not to have heard that there is a Holy Ghost, and many deem all that is spoken concerning his graces and comforts, to be delusion. Of such it may properly be inquired, Unto what, then, were ye baptized? for they evidently know not the meaning of that outward sign on which they place great dependence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when Paul laid his hands ... - See the notes on <a href="/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>.<p>And they spake with tongues - See the notes on <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a>.<p>And prophesied - See the notes on <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>; <a href="/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

After the baptism the imposition of the hands of the apostle (see on <a href="/acts/8-15.htm" title="Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:">Acts 8:15</a>, remark) became the vehicle of the reception of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span> on the part of the minds opened by the apostolic word. The Spirit descended upon them, and manifested Himself partly by their speaking with tongues (see on <a href="/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>), and partly in prophetic inspiration (see on <a href="/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>). These two must, according to the technical mode of reference to them in the apostolic church attested by 1 Corinthians 12-14, be <span class="ital">distinguished</span>, and not treated as equivalent, with van Hengel, who (comp. on chap. <a href="/acts/2-10.htm" title="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,">Acts 2:10</a>) finds here merely in general an expression of the inspired praising aloud of God in Christ. See his <span class="ital">Gave d. talen</span>, p. 84 ff.; Trip, p. 185, follows him. The analogy of the phenomenon with what occurred in the history of Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a> ff.) serves Baur, I. p. 212 f., ed. 2 (with whom Zeller agrees; and see earlier, Schneckenburger, p. 56 ff.), for a handle to condemn the whole narrative as unhistorical, and to refer it to the set purpose of placing the Apostle Paul, by a new and telling proof of his apostolic dignity and efficiency, on a parallel with the Apostle Peter. The author had, in Baur’s view, seeing that the first <span class="greekheb">γλώσσαις λαλεῖν</span> (chap. 2) is exhibited in the person of <span class="ital">Jews</span>, and the second (chap. 10) in that of <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, now chosen for the third a <span class="ital">middle class</span>, half-believers (like the Samaritans! see Schwegler). With all this presumed refinement of invention, it is yet singular that the author should not have carried out his parallelism of Paul with Peter even so far as to make the descent of the Holy Spirit and the speaking with tongues take place, as with Cornelius, <span class="ital">before</span> baptism, on the mere <span class="ital">preaching</span> of the apostle! People <span class="ital">themselves</span> weave such fictions, and give forth the author of the book, which is thus criticised, as the ingenious weaver.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/acts/19-7.htm" title="And all the men were about twelve.">Acts 19:7</a>. A simple historical statement, not in order to represent the men “<span class="ital">as a new Israel</span>.”[93]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[93] So Baumgarten, II. p. 7, whom the very <span class="greekheb">ὡσεί</span> ought to have preserved from this fancy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπιθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς τοῦ Π</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὰς χ</span>., see above on <a href="/acts/8-16.htm" title="(For as yet he was fallen on none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)">Acts 8:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐλάλουν τε γλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ προεφ</span>.: the imperfects may mean that they began to speak, or that the exercise of the gifts mentioned continued. The two gifts are discussed in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="For the body is not one member, but many.">1 Corinthians 12:14</a>, in an Epistle which was written probably during this stay at Ephesus—no doubt the gifts are specially mentioned because the bestowal of such gifts distinguished Christian Baptism from that of John. McGiffert, p. 286, while admitting the accuracy of the account as a whole, thinks that its representation is moulded, as in 8, in accordance with the work of Peter and John in Samaria; so too Hilgenfeld refers the account to his “author to Theophilus,” who also, in <a href="/acts/8-16.htm" title="(For as yet he was fallen on none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)">Acts 8:16</a>, narrates that the baptised Samaritans received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Peter’s hands. This is in some respects not unlike the older view of Baur, who held that the narrative was introduced to parallel Paul’s dignity and work with that of Peter in <a href="/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>—the first speaking with tongues in 2 is narrated in relation to Jews, the second in relation to Gentiles, 10, and the third in relation to a kind of middle class, half-believers like the Samaritans! (so Zeller and Schneckenburger). But not only does this require us to identify 2 with 10 and 19, the speaking of tongues at Pentecost with subsequent bestowal of the gift, but it seems strange that a narrative should not have been constructed more free from liability to misconception and misinterpretation if the leading purpose of its introduction had been as supposed above.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">And when Paul</span>, &c.] The gift of the Holy Ghost to these disciples appears to have been a special provision of the Spirit for the great work which was to change Ephesus, from the city wholly devoted to the goddess Diana, into the centre of Christian life throughout the west of Asia Minor for several centuries.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and they spake with tongues</span>] A Pentecostal outpouring, for as in Jerusalem the gift wrought its effect among the Jews then gathered there from every quarter, so was the Spirit given in this great centre of Gentile activity that a like result might follow, and that the amazement and marvel at such a power might win attention to the message and gain converts to Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and prophesied</span>] Probably in this case to be understood of the exposition of Old Testament prophecy, and the power of preaching bestowed on them by the gift of the Holy Ghost.
