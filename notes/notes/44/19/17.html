They saw that the name of Christ was not to be trifled with, or taken into their mouths rashly, nor his religion confounded with the pagan superstitions. Hence his name, by which his faithful servants cast out devils and cured diseases, without any resistance, <span class="ital">was </span>the more <span class="ital">magnified </span>— For now it appeared to be a name above every name. <span class="ital">And many </span>— Who had formerly been professors of unwarrantable arts, but who now <span class="ital">believed </span>— Being strongly impressed by what had happened, and struck with the power of the evil spirit over the sons of Sceva; <span class="ital">came </span>— To Paul, of their own accord; <span class="ital">and confessed </span>— That they had attempted to cure diseased persons by charms and other magical practices; <span class="ital">and showed</span> <span class="ital">their deeds </span>— The devices by which they had deceived the multitude; or made a public declaration of their unlawful practices. <span class="ital">Many of them also, who used </span>these <span class="ital">curious arts </span>— Magical arts, to which that soft appellation was given by those that practised them, now firmly believing the gospel; <span class="ital">brought their books </span>— In which the different forms of incantation for different diseases were prescribed, the method of making these incantations was showed, the herbs and other medicines to be used with these incantations were pointed out, and the seasons for using them were fixed. <span class="ital">And burned them before all men — </span>Who were present; <span class="ital">and </span>— A great many of them being judged of high value in that place; <span class="ital">they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver </span>— If these be taken for Jewish shekels, and valued at three shillings each, (which are the principles of Dr. Benson’s computation,) the sum will amount to seven thousand five hundred pounds sterling; or, setting it at two shillings and sixpence, to six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds. Nevertheless, the owners of them made a willing sacrifice of them to truth and piety; because the arts themselves being unlawful, it was not fit that the books which taught them should be in the possession of any person whatever. <span class="ital">So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed </span>— So remarkable was the triumph of the gospel over all considerations of honour or interest that could be opposed to it on this, or on any other occasion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:13-20 It was common, especially among the Jews, for persons to profess or to try to cast out evil spirits. If we resist the devil by faith in Christ, he will flee from us; but if we think to resist him by the using of Christ's name, or his works, as a spell or charm, Satan will prevail against us. Where there is true sorrow for sin, there will be free confession of sin to God in every prayer and to man whom we have offended, when the case requires it. Surely if the word of God prevailed among us, many lewd, infidel, and wicked books would be burned by their possessors. Will not these Ephesian converts rise up in judgement against professors, who traffic in such works for the sake of gain, or allow themselves to possess them? If we desire to be in earnest in the great work of salvation, every pursuit and enjoyment must be given up which hinders the effect of the gospel upon the mind, or loosens its hold upon the heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The name of the Lord Jesus was magnified - Acquired increasing honor. The transaction showed that the miracles performed in the name of the Lord Jesus by Paul were real, and were performed in attestation of the truth of the doctrine which he taught. Impostors could not work such miracles; and they who pretended to be able to do it only exposed themselves to the rage of evil spirits. It was thus shown that there was a real, vital difference between Paul and these impostors, and their failure only served to extend his reputation and the power of the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Comp. <a href="/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11-14</a>, where the same effects are ascribed to the death of Ananias and Sapphire and the signs and wonders which were wrought by the apostles at that time. This fear produced by the putting forth of God's power paralyzed for a time the enemies of the gospel, and enabled believers, as it were, to take possession of their new heritage, just as the miracles at the Red Sea and the destruction of Sihon and Og paralyzed the courage of the Canaanites and enabled the Israelites to take possession of their land (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). With respect to the incident which caused this fear, it might at first seem inconsistent with our Lord's saying to the apostles (<a href="/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49, 50</a>). But the cases were very different. He who cast out devils in the name of Jesus, in the Gospel, does not seem to have had any hostility to the faith, for our Lord speaks of him as one who "is not against us." But these sons of Sceva were among the unbelieving Jews who were "hardened and disobedient;" and if their exorcisms had been permitted to succeed, they would have had power to withstand Paul, as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, and the very purpose for which miraculous power was given to St. Paul would have been frustrated. There- fore they were discomfited, and the subtle design of Satan to destroy, while seeming to magnify, the Name of Jesus was signally defeated. Comp. the somewhat similar incident at Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-18</a>). Justin Martyr, in his 'Diologue with Trypho,' quoted by Alford on <a href="/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>, speaks of the Jews as exorcising, sometimes in the name of kings (referring, doubtless, to Solomon), sometimes of just men, or of prophets, or of patriarchs.
