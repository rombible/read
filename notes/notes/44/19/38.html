There are some grounds for adopting the last alternative. Junius Silanus, who was Proconsul of Asia when St. Paul arrived in Ephesus (A.D. 54), had been poisoned by Celer and Helius, the two procurators, at the instigation of Agrippina; and it seems probable that they for a time held a joint proconsular authority.<p><span class= "bld">Let them implead one another.</span>—The English word exactly expresses the technical force of the Greek.

Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have a matter against any man - Have a complaint of injury; if injustice has been done them by anyone.<p>The law is open - See the margin. &#x391;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  Agoraioi &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  agontai, that is, &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  he&#772;merai.

Or <span class="greekheb">ἡμέραι</span> may alone be supplied = court days are kept, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, at certain intervals, not implying at that particular time, but rather a general statement as in the words that follow: “there are proconsuls,” see Page, <span class="ital">in loco.</span> For <span class="greekheb">ἄγειν</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/24-21.htm" title="But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.">Luke 24:21</a>, <a href="/matthew/14-6.htm" title="But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.">Matthew 14:6</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-16.htm" title="Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the same days.">2Ma 2:16</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Strabo, xiii., p. 932, Latin, <span class="ital">conventus agere</span>. Alford, so Wendt (1888), speaks of the distinction drawn by the old grammarians between <span class="greekheb">ἀγοραῖος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀγόραιος</span> as groundless, but see also Winer-Schmiedel, p. 69.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνθύπατοί εἰσιν</span>: the plural is used: “de eo quod nunquam non esse, soleat,” Bengel (quoted by Blass and Wendt), although strictly there would be only one proconsul at a time. There is no need to understand any assistants of the proconsul, as if the description was meant for them, or, with Lewin, as if there were several persons with proconsular power. It is quite possible that in both clauses the secretary is speaking in a mere colloquial way, as we might say, “There are assizes and there are judges”. Lightfoot calls it “a rhetorical plural” <span class="ital">Cont. Rev.</span>, p. 295, 1878, and quotes Eur., <span class="ital">I.

The verb need not have a technical legal sense as is implied by “implead” in A.V. So in LXX it may be used quite generally, or of a criminal charge, and so in classical Greek, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/12-12.htm" title="For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?">Wis 12:12</a> and <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/46-19.htm" title="And before his long sleep he made protestations in the sight of the Lord and his anointed, I have not taken any man's goods, so much as a shoe: and no man did accuse him.">Sir 46:19</a>. In the N.T. it is used six times in Acts with reference to judicial process, and only once elsewhere by St. Paul in <a href="/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.">Romans 8:33</a> in a general sense. The verb only occurs in the second part of Acts in accordance no doubt with the subject-matter; see Hawkins, <span class="ital">Horæ Synopticæ</span>, p. 147, note, and Weiss, <span class="ital">Einleitung in das N.

For the concerns in which they are interested will be such as the legal tribunals can attend to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the law is open</span>] This gives the general sense. The words are in the plural number and mean either “court-<span class="ital">days</span> are appointed,” i.e. there are proper times fixed when such causes can be heard; or perhaps better, because of the verb which seems to imply that the opportunity of legal action is even now open, “court-<span class="ital">meetings</span> are now going on.” This the <span class="ital">Rev.

Ver.</span>, for Asia was a proconsular province (see on this matter Conybeare and Howson, ii. 78). The difficulty in the present verse has arisen from the use of the plural number, for there was only one proconsul over a province at the same time, and there could only be one in Ephesus when the townclerk was speaking. But if we consider that he is speaking merely of the provision made by the institutions of the empire for obtaining justice in a case of wrong, we can see that his words need not occasion much trouble. “Proconsuls are (he says) an imperial institution. In every province like ours there exists such a supreme magistrate, and so there is no fear about obtaining redress for real injuries.” Another explanation (due to Basnage, and alluded to in the notes of Conybeare and Howson, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>) is that after the poisoning of Silanus the proconsul, (as related Tac. <span class="ital">An</span>. xiii. 1) Celer and Ælius, who governed the province of Asia as <span class="ital">procurators</span>, might be intended by this plural title. Others have thought that there might be present in Ephesus some other proconsul from a neighbouring province, as Cilicia, Cyprus, Bithynia or elsewhere; but what was first said seems the easier explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let them implead one another</span>] <span class="ital">Implead</span> is somewhat antiquated now, and the <span class="ital">Rev.

So Suidas explains it, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">There are proconsuls</span>. Bengel, with whom Meyer agrees, thinks the plural denotes the unbroken succession of proconsuls. But Lewin thinks it may mark the exact time of these transactions as being immediately after the poisoning of the Proconsul Junius Silanus by order of Agrippina, when the two procurators, Celer and AElius, exercised the proconsular power till the appointment of another proconsul, according to a law of Claudius to that effect.
