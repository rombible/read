It was to be poured upon the ground as water; doubtless, 1st, To be a token to mankind, in all ages, that they would have had no right to take the life of any animal for food, if God had not given them that right, who, therefore, to remind them of it, and impress it on their minds in all generations, denied them the use of blood, and required it to be spilt upon the ground. 2d, In honour of the blood of atonement, <a href="/context/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul....">Leviticus 17:11-12</a>.

We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel. May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, and attests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and consciences will be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from the burdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabas showed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of the pure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore to press that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion of James was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled about Jewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that they should be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by the Gentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of their rites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and from eating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here, from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then still offered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and further prejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, we are left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warned to avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, or are likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian liberty with moderation and prudence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My sentence - Greek: I judge &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  krino&#772; that is, I give my opinion.

Both modes of partaking of flesh offered in sacrifice, for which the Gentile Christians had opportunity enough either by invitations on the part of their heathen friends or by the usual practice of purchase, were to be avoided by them as fellowship with idolatry, and thus as polluting Christian sanctity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τῆς πορνείας</span>] As in the decree, <a href="/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well.

Such expedients are only resorted to, because all the other particulars are not immoral in themselves, but <span class="greekheb">ἀδιάφορα</span>, which only become immoral through the existing circumstances. But the association of <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> with three <span class="ital">adiaphora</span> is to be explained from the then moral corruption of heathenism, by which fornication, regarded from of old with indulgence and even with favour, nay, practised without shame even by philosophers, and surrounded by poets with all the tinsel of lasciviousness, had become in public opinion a thing really indifferent;[31] Grotius <span class="ital">in loc</span>., Hermann, <span class="ital">Privatalterth</span>. § 29, 13 ff.

With the deep reverence of the Hebrews for the sanctity of blood was essentially connected the idea of blood-sacrifice; and therefore the prohibition of partaking of blood, in respect of its origin and importance (it was accompanied with severe penalties), was very different from the prohibition of unclean animals.

II. p. 240.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[30] But that the apostles had here in view a sanctification of marriage by the cognizance or approval of the rulers of the church, so that the germ of the <span class="ital">ecclesiastical nuptial ceremony</span> is to be found here, is very arbitrarily assumed by Lange, <span class="ital">apost</span>. <span class="ital">Zeitalt</span>. II. p. 185.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[31] That even among the heathen the <span class="ital">sinfulness</span> of sexual abuse was recognised (as Hofmann, <span class="ital">heil. Schr. N.T.</span> I. p. 131, objects), makes no difference as regards the <span class="ital">whole</span> of their moral attitude and tendency. Voices of earnest and thoughtful men in Greece and Rome were raised against all vices. Hofmann attaches to the notion of <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> a width which the word, as actually used, has not: “Unbridledness of natural sexual conduct, which neither knows nor desires to know moral restriction.” Thus the word, in his view, applies not only to sexual intercourse in relationship, but also to <span class="ital">sexual conduct in marriage</span> (?).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[32] The omission of <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦ πνικτοῦ</span> in D and Fathers, though approved by Bornemann (here and in ver. 29), can only be regarded as a copyist’s error occasioned by <span class="ital">Homoioteleuton</span> (<span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦ</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦ</span>). So decisive are the witnesses in favour of these words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following general observations are to be made on <a href="/acts/15-20.htm" title="But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.">Acts 15:20</a> compared with <a href="/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a> :—1. The opinion of James and the resolution of the assembly is purely <span class="ital">negative;</span> the Gentile brethren were not to be subjected to <span class="greekheb">παρενοχλεῖν</span>, but they were expected merely <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχεσθαι</span>, and that from four matters, which according to the common Gentile opinion were regarded as indifferent, but were deeply offensive to the rigidly legal Jewish-Christians. The <span class="ital">moral</span> element of these points is <span class="ital">here</span> accordingly left entirely out of account; the design of the prohibition refers only to the legal strictness of the Jewish-Christians, between whom and the Gentile-Christians the existing dispute was to be settled, and the fellowship of brotherly intercourse was to be provisionally restored. The Gentile-Christian, for the avoidance of offence towards his Jewish brother, was to abstain as well from that which exhibited <span class="ital">the fundamental character of heathenism</span> (pollutions of idols and fornication; comp. on the latter, <a href="/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a> ff.), as from those things by which, in the intercourse of Christian fellowship, the <span class="ital">most important points</span> of the restrictions on <span class="ital">food appointed by God for Israel</span> might be prematurely overthrown, to the offence of the Jewish-Christians.—2. <span class="ital">That precisely these four points are adduced</span>, and neither more nor other, is simply to be explained from the fact, that historically, and according to the experience of that time, next to circumcision these were the stumbling-blocks in ordinary intercourse between the two sections of Christians; and not, as Olshausen and Ebrard, following many older commentators, suppose (comp. also Ritschl, <span class="ital">altkath. K.</span> p. 129; Wieseler, p. 185; Holtzmann, <span class="ital">Judenth. u. Christenth</span>. p. 571 f.), from the fact that they were accustomed to be imposed on the proselytes of the gate in the so-called seven precepts of Noah (see the same in <span class="ital">Sanh</span>. 56 <span class="ital">a</span> <span class="ital">b</span>; Maimonides, <span class="ital">Tr. Melach</span>. 9. 1), and that the meaning of the injunction is, that the Gentile-Christians had no need to become proselytes of righteousness by circumcision, but were only obliged to live as proselytes of the gate, or at least were to regard themselves as placed in a closer relation and fellowship to the Jewish people (Baumgarten). Were this the case, we cannot see why the decree should not have attached itself more precisely and fully to the Noachic precepts,[33] to which not a single one of the four points expressly belonged; and therefore the matter has nothing at all in common with the proselytism of the gate. Comp. also Oertel, p. 249; Hofmann, <span class="ital">h. Schr. d. N.T.</span> I. p. 128 ff.—3. That the proposal of James, and the decree drawn up in accordance with it, <span class="ital">were to have no permanent force as a rule of conduct</span>, is clear from the entire connection in which it arose. It was called forth by the circumstances of the times; it was to be a compromise as long as these circumstances lasted; but its value as such was extinguished of itself by the cessation of the circumstances—namely, as soon as the strengthening of the Christian spirit, and of the Christian moral freedom of both parties, rendered the provisional regulation superfluous. Comp. Ritschl, <span class="ital">altkath. K.</span> p. 138 f. Therefore Augustine strikingly remarks (<span class="ital">c. Manich</span>. 32. 13): <span class="ital">“Elegisse mihi videntur pro tempore rem facilem et nequaquam observantibus onerosam, in qua cum Israelitis etiam gentes propter angularem illum lapidem duos in se condentem aliquid communiter observarent. Transacto vero illo tempore, quo illi duo parietes, unus de circumcisione, alter de praeputio venientes, quamvis in angulari lapide concordarent, tamen suis quibusdam proprietatibus distinctius eminebant, ac ubi ecclesia gentium talis effecta est, ut in ea nullus Israelita carnalis appareat: quis jam hoc Christianus observat, ut turdas vel minutiores aviculas non attingat, nisi quarum sanguis effusus est, aut leporem non edat, si manu a cervice percussus nullo cruento vulnere occisus est? Et qui forte pauci tangere ista formidant, a caeteris irridentur, ita omnium animos in hac re tenuit sententia veritatis.” In contrast to this correct view stand the Canon, apost</span>. 63 (<span class="greekheb">εἰ τις ἐπίσκοπος ἢ πρεσβύτερος ἢ διάκονος ἢ ὅλως τοῦ καταλόγου τοῦ ἱερατικοῦ φάγῃ κρέα ἐν αἵματι ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ θηριάλωτον ἢ θνησιμαῖον</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθαιρείσθω</span>· <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο γὰρ ὁ νόμος ἀπεῖπεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ δὲ λαϊκὸς εἴη</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀφοριζέσθω</span>), and not less the Clementine Homilies, vii. 4, and many Fathers in Suicer, <span class="ital">Thes</span>. I. p. 113, as also the <span class="ital">Concil. Trull.</span> II. <span class="ital">Can.</span> 67, and exegetical writers cited in Wolf.[34] It is self-evident withal, that not only the prohibition of <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span>, but also the general moral tenor and fundamental thought of the whole decree (the idea of Christian freedom, to the use of which merely relative limits given in the circumstances, and not an absolute ethical limitation, must be assigned), have permanent validity, such as Paul exhibited in his conduct and teaching.—4. The Tübingen criticism, finding in Galatians 2 the Archimedean point for its lever, has sought to relegate the whole narrative of the apostolic council and its decree to the unhistorical sphere (see besides, Baur, I. 119 ff. ed. 2, Schwegler, Zeller, Holsten, especially Hilgenfeld in <span class="ital">Comm. z. Br. an d. Gal</span>., and in his <span class="ital">Zeitschr. f. wiss. Theol</span>. 1858, p. 317 ff., 1860, p. 118 ff., <span class="ital">Kanon u. Krit. d. N.T.</span> p. 188 ff.); because the comparison with Galatians 2 exhibits contradictions, which cause the narrative of the Acts to be recognised as an irenic fiction. It is alleged, namely, that by its incorrect representation the deeply seated difference between the Jewish-Christianity of the original apostles and Paulinism free from the law was to be as much as possible concealed, with a view to promote union. Holtzmann, <span class="ital">Judenth. und Christenth</span>. p. 568 ff., more cautiously weighs the matter, but still expresses doubt. For a defence of its historical character, see Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol</span>. p. 189 ff., and in his <span class="ital">Comm. z. Br. an d. Gal.;</span>[35] Ebrard, § 125; Baumgarten, p. 401 ff.; Schaff, <span class="ital">Gesch. d. apost. K.</span> p. 252 ff., ed. 2; Schneckenburger in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

The contradictions, which serve as premisses for the attack upon our narrative, are not really present in <a href="/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a> ff. For—and these are the most essential points in the question—in Galatians 2. Paul narrates the matter not in a purely historical interest, but in personal defence of his apostolic authority, and therefore adduces incidents and aspects of what happened at Jerusalem, which do not make it at all necessary historically to exclude our narrative. Moreover, even in Galatians 2 the original apostles are not in principle at variance, but at one, with Paul (comp. Bleek, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. p. 253 f.); as follows from <a href="/acts/15-6.htm" title="And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.">Acts 15:6</a>, from the reproach of hypocrisy made against Peter, <a href="/context/acts/15-12.htm" title="Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the Gentiles by them....">Acts 15:12-13</a> (which supposes an agreement in conviction between him and Paul), from the <span class="greekheb">ἐθνικῶς ζῇς</span>, <a href="/acts/15-14.htm" title="Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.">Acts 15:14</a>, and from the speech in common, <a href="/acts/15-16.htm" title="After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:">Acts 15:16</a> ff. (see evasions, on account of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΌΚΡΙΣΙς</span></span></span>, in Schwegler and Baur). Further, in Galatians 2. Paul is not contrasted with the original apostles in respect of doctrine (for the circumcision of Titus was not demanded by <span class="ital">them</span>), but as regards the field of their operations in reference to the same gospel, <a href="/acts/15-9.htm" title="And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.">Acts 15:9</a>. By <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἰδίαν</span>, again, <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>, is meant a private conference (comp. on <a href="/acts/15-6.htm" title="And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.">Acts 15:6</a>), which had nothing to do with the transactions of our narrative; nor is the care for the poor determined on, <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>, a matter excluding the definitions of our decree, particularly as Paul only describes an agreement which had been made, not in any sort of public assembly, but merely between him and the three original apostles; the observance of the decree was an independent matter, and was understood of itself. In fine, the absence of any mention of the council and decree in the Pauline Epistles, particularly in the Epistle to the Galatians (and even in the discussion on meats offered in sacrifice, <a href="/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1 Corinthians 8:13</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/15-19.htm" title="Why my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:">Acts 15:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">διὸ ἐγὼ κρίνω</span>: “wherefore my judgment is”. St. James apparently speaks as the president of the meeting, Chrysostom, <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, xxxiii., and his words with the emphatic <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> (Weiss) may express more than the opinion of a private member—he sums up the debate and proposes “the draught of a practical resolution” (see however Hort, <span class="ital">Ecclesia</span>, 79; Hackett, <span class="ital">in loco;</span> and on the other hand Moberly, <span class="ital">Ministerial Priesthood</span>, p. 147). If a position of authority is thus given to St. James at the conference, it is very significant that this should be so in Jerusalem itself, where the Twelve would naturally carry special weight. But this presidency and Apostolic authority of St. James in Jerusalem is exactly in accordance with the remarkable order of the three names referred to by St. Paul in <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/12-17.htm" title="But he, beckoning to them with the hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.
