It must be observed, the church at Antioch consisted chiefly of converted proselytes; and their joy would be in proportion to the anxiety and suspense with which they had waited for the apostles’ determination. <span class="ital">And Judas and Silas </span>— The special messengers from Jerusalem thither; <span class="ital">being prophets also themselves </span>— That is, preachers of the gospel, or teachers in the church; <span class="ital">exhorted the brethren with many words </span>— Did not only deliver the particular message with which they were charged, but, on the occasion of such a numerous and solemn auditory, each of them discoursed largely on the truths and duties of Christianity, exhorting them to adhere to the gospel they had embraced, and to adorn it by a corresponding conduct; <span class="ital">and confirmed them </span>— Not only in the belief of their freedom from the law of Moses, as a term of salvation, but in every branch of Christian faith and practice. <span class="ital">And after they had continued there a space </span>— A competent time; <span class="ital">they were let go in peace </span>— Were dismissed, doubtless, with earnest prayers for the divine blessing upon them and their labours, and with all possible expressions of kindness and respect unto the apostles, <span class="ital">from whom they came.

It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From meats offered to idols - This explains what is meant by "pollutions of idols," <a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>.<p>Ye shall do well - You will do what ought to be done in regard to the subjects of dispute. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28, 29.

The only cause for hesitation arises from "fornication" being mixed up with the other three things; which has led many to regard the whole as permanently prohibited. But the remarks on Ac 15:20 may clear this (see on [2026]Ac 15:20). The then state of heathen society in respect of all the four things seems the reason for so mixing them up.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When they were dismissed; </span> Paul, Barnabas, Judas, and Silas; which two last, were sent with the former. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gathered the multitude together; </span> from whom they were sent, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.">Acts 15:1</a>,2</span>, and that this determination of the council might be more publicly known, as all things concerning our common salvation ought to be. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So when they were dismissed,....
