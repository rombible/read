The warmth of previous affection, of a friendship begun probably in boyhood, and cemented by new hopes, and a great work in which both were sharers, made the breach between the two more painful. At this stage, both Barnabas and Mark disappear from the history of the Acts, but it will be worth while to note the chief facts in the after-history of each. (1) Probably Barnabas and Paul met again in the visit of <a href="/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>, unless, indeed, we refer the incidents of <a href="/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-13</a> to an earlier period, and then there was a yet further cause of division in his yielding to the dissimulation of the Judaising teachers. (2) In writing to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1Corinthians 9:6</a>) the Apostle names Barnabas as setting the same noble example as himself in labouring with his own hands and accepting nothing from the churches. (3) On the later life of Mark see the <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Mark’s Gospel.</span> Here it will be sufficient to note that the discipline did its work. After labouring with his cousin in Cyprus, he appears to have returned to St. Peter, as his first father in the faith, and to have been with him at Babylon (<a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>). He and St. Paul met during the latter’s first imprisonment at Rome (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>), and the Apostle learnt to recognise in him one who was “profitable to him for the ministry” (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me.

Barnabas wished his nephew John Mark to go with them. We should suspect ourselves of being partial, and guard against this in putting our relations forward. Paul did not think him worthy of the honour, nor fit for the service, who had departed from them without their knowledge, or without their consent: see ch.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the contention was so sharp - The word used here &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  paroxusmos is that from which our word "paroxysm" is derived. It may denote "any excitement of mind," and is used in a good sense in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>. It here means, however, "a violent altercation" that resulted in their separation for a time, and in their engaging in different spheres of labor.<p>And sailed into Cyprus - This was the native place of Barnabas.

And the contention was so sharp between them&#8212;such was the "irritation," or "exacerbation."<p>that they departed asunder one from the other&#8212;Said they not truly to the Lystrians that they were "men of like passions with them"; (Ac 14:15). But who was to blame? (1) That John Mark had either tired of the work or shrunk from the dangers and fatigues that yet lay before them, was undeniable; and Paul concluded that what he had done he might, and probably would, do again. Was he wrong in this? (See Pr 25:19). But (2) To this Barnabas might reply that no rule was without exception; that one failure, in a young Christian, was not enough to condemn him for life; that if near relationship might be thought to warp his judgment, it also gave him opportunities of knowing the man better than others; and that as he was himself anxious to be allowed another trial (and the result makes this next to certain), in order that he might wipe out the effect of his former failure and show what "hardness he could now endure as a good soldier of Jesus Christ," his petition ought not to be rejected. Now, since John Mark did retrieve his character in these respects, and a reconciliation took place between Paul and him, so cordial that the apostle expresses more than once the confidence he had in him and the value he set upon his services (Col 4:10, 11; 2Ti 4:11), it may seem that events showed Barnabas to be in the right, and Paul too harsh and hasty in his judgment. But, in behalf of Paul, it may well be answered, that not being able to see into the future he had only the unfavorable past to judge by; that the gentleness of Barnabas (Ac 4:36; 11:24) had already laid him open to imposition (see on [2028]Ga 2:13), to which near relationship would in this case make him more liable; and that in refusing to take John Mark on this missionary journey he was not judging his Christian character nor pronouncing on his fitness for future service, but merely providing in the meantime against being again put to serious inconvenience and having their hands weakened by a possible second desertion. On the whole, then, it seems clear that each of these great servants of&#8212;Christ had something to say for himself, in defense of the position which they respectively took up; that while Barnabas was quite able to appreciate the grounds on which Paul proceeded, Paul was not so competent to judge of the considerations which Barnabas probably urged; that while Paul had but one object in view, to see that the companion of their arduous work was one of thoroughly congenial spirit and sufficient nerve, Barnabas, over and above the same desire, might not unreasonably be afraid for the soul of his nephew, lest the refusal to allow him to accompany them on their journey might injure his Christian character and deprive the Church of a true servant of Jesus Christ; and that while both sought only the glory of their common Master, each looked at the question at issue, to some extent, through the medium of his own temperament, which grace sanctifies and refines, but does not destroy&#8212;Paul, through the medium of absolute devotion to the cause and kingdom of Christ, which, warm and womanly as his affections were, gave a tinge of lofty sternness to his resolves where that seemed to be affected; Barnabas, through the medium of the same singleness of heart in Christ's service, though probably not in equal strength (Ga 2:13), but also of a certain natural gentleness which, where a Christian relative was concerned, led him to attach more weight to what seemed for his spiritual good than Paul could be supposed to do. In these circumstances, it seems quite possible that they might have amicably "agreed to differ," each taking his own companion, as they actually did. But the "paroxysm" (as the word is), the "exacerbation" which is expressly given as the cause of their parting, shows but too plainly, that human infirmity amidst the great labors of the Church at Antioch at length sundered those who had sweetly and lovingly borne together the heat and burden of the day during a protracted tour in the service of Christ. "Therefore let no man glory in men" (1Co 3:21). As for John Mark, although through his uncle's warm advocacy of his cause he was put in a condition to dissipate the cloud that hung over him, how bitter to him must have ever afterwards been the reflection that it was his culpable conduct which gave occasion to whatever was sinful in the strife between Paul and Barnabas, and to a separation in action, though no doubt with a mutual Christian regard, between those who had till then wrought nobly together! How watchful does all this teach Christians, and especially Christian ministers and missionaries, to be against giving way to rash judgment and hot temper towards each other, especially where on both sides the glory of Christ is the ground of difference! How possible is it that in such cases both parties may, on the question at issue, be more or less in the right! How difficult is it even for the most faithful and devoted servants of Christ, differing as they do in their natural temperament even under the commanding influence of grace, to see even important questions precisely in the same light! And if, with every disposition to yield what is unimportant, they still feel it a duty each to stand to his own point, how careful should they be to do it lovingly, each pursuing his own course without disparagement of his Christian brother! And how affectingly does the Lord overrule such difference of judgment and such manifestations of human infirmity, by making them "turn out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel"; as in this case is eminently seen in the two missionary parties instead of one, not travelling over the same ground and carrying their dispute over all the regions of their former loving labors, but dividing the field between them!<p>and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; and Paul chose Silas&#8212;(See on [2029]Ac 15:34)&#8212;going two and two, as the Twelve and the Seventy (Mr 6:7; Lu 10:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They departed asunder; </span> as Abraham and Lot parted, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/13-9.htm" title="Is not the whole land before you? separate yourself, I pray you, from me: if you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.">Genesis 13:9</a></span>, yet keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; loving of and praying for one another, as we may judge, being both good men.

About this matter; Barnabas insisting on it, that John Mark should go with them, he being a relation of his; and in whose favour it might be urged, that his mother Mary was an excellent good woman, who had received the saints into her house, in a time of persecution; and that it should be considered, that this her son was but a young man, and could not be thought to have that courage, resolution, constancy, and solidity, as older professors and ministers; and that his crime was not very heinous, and should be overlooked. Paul, on the other hand, opposing his going with them, as a very unworthy person, because he had behaved so cowardly, and had shown such a coldness and indifference to the work of the ministry, and had so shamefully left them; and thus they disputed the point till there was a paroxysm between them, as is the word used: they were irritated and provoked by one another, and were so warmed and heated on both sides, <p>that they departed asunder one from another; thus as soon almost as peace was made in the church, a difference arises among the ministers of the word, who are men of like passions with others; and though it is not easy to say which was to blame most in this contention; perhaps there were faults on both sides, for the best men are not without their failings; yet this affair was overruled by the providence of God, for the spread of his Gospel, and the enlargement of his interest; for when these two great and good men parted from one another, they went to different places, preaching the word of God: <p>and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus; <p>See Gill on <a href="/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{16}</span> And <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</span><p>(16) God uses the faults of his servants to the profit and building of the Church: yet we have to take heed, even in the best matters, that we do not let our anger overflow.<p>(r) They were in great heat: but in this we have to consider the power of God's counsel, for by this means it came to pass that the doctrine of the Gospel was spread into many places.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39</a>. <span class="greekheb">παροξυσμός</span>, <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm" title="And let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works:">Hebrews 10:24</a>, in different sense, nowhere else in N.T.

Whatever his fortunes may have been, St. Luke did not estimate his work in the same category as that of Paul as a main factor in the development of the Church, although we must never forget that “twice over did Barnabas save Saul for the work of Christianity”.—<span class="greekheb">Μάρκον</span>: In his two imprisonments St. Paul mentions Mark in terms of high approval, <a href="/context/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)...">Colossians 4:10-11</a>, <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me.

Barnabas was leaning more on the lenient view of the case, Paul, on the truth [strict justice]. There is no other sin of which there is greater danger in the case of holy and great colleagues. “How comprehensive is the grace, how powerful the faith, which, in the midst of the world, in the midst of sin, amidst so many snares of Satan, and in the case of such incredible infirmity on our parts, notwithstanding sanctifies, still sustains, and preserves!”—Justus Jonas.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποχωρισθῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">that they departed asunder</span>) This separation also was directed (overruled) by the Lord to good. For so out of one pair, two were made: and Paul having obtained, instead of one colleague who was his equal, several subordinates, was the less restricted in his movements. Paul also afterwards made kind mention of Barnabas: <a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκπλεῦσαι</span>) <span class="ital">sailed forth</span>, on a different course.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> only occurs twice in the New Testament: once in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>, in a good sense, "To provoke" (for a provocation) - " stimulate or excite"  - " unto love and good works," which is its common classical sense; the other time in this passage, where the sense is attributed to it in which it is used in the LXX., as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-28.htm">Deuteronomy 29:28</a>,  <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, "in great indignation;" and in <a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a> (39. 37, LXX.), coupled with the same words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, "in great wrath;" answering to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span>in Hebrew. But it is more probable that St. <span class="accented">Luke</span> uses the word here in its common medical sense. In medical writers  - Galen, Hippocrates, etc. - the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to what we call <span class="accented">an access</span>, from the Latin <span class="accented">aecessio</span>, used by Celsus, when a disease of some standing takes a turn for the worse, comes to a height, and breaks out into its severest form. This is the sense in which our English word "paroxysm" is used. The meaning of the passage will then be that, after a good deal of uncomfortable feeling and discussion, the difference between Paul and Barnabas, instead of cooling down, broke out into such an acute form that Barnabas went off to Cyprus with Mark, leaving St. Paul to do what he pleased by himself. <span class="cmt_word">And Barnabas</span>, etc. The R.V. is much more accurate. The consequence of the quarrel is said by St. Luke to have been that Barnabas took Mark off with him to Cyprus. The statement that Paul chose Silas is a separate and independent statement, as appears by <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in the nominative) and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in the indicative mood. St. Luke's narrative quite sides with St. Paul, and throws the blame of the quarrel, or at least of the separation, upon Barnabas. Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 119) thinks St. Paul was too severe upon John Mark, and that it was ungrateful of him to break with one to whom he owed so much as he did to Barnabas for any cause of secondary importance. He also thinks that the real root of the quarrel lay in the constantly changing relations between the two apostles, aggravated by a domineering spirit in St. Paul. But the force of this censure turns upon the question whether it was a cause of <span class="accented">secondary</span> importance. If St. Paul had a single eye to the success of his mission, and judged that Mark would be a hindrance to it, it was a question <span class="accented">of primary</span> importance to "the work," and St. Paul was right. Renan also remarks upon the extinction of the fame of Barnabas consequent upon this separation from his more illustrious companion. "While Paul kept advancing to the heights of his glory, Barnabas, separated from the companion who had shed a portion of his own luster upon him, pursued his solitary course in obscurity." <span class="cmt_word">Sailed away</span>. Cyprus was Barnabas's native country (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), and the scene of the earliest mission (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>), and of Paul and Barnabas's first joint evangelistic labors (<a href="/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>). Barnabas would have many friends there, and could form plans at his leisure for his future action. The friendly mention of him in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a> shows both that he continued his disinterested labors as an apostle and that the estrangement between him and St. Paul had passed away. The <span class="accented">paroxysm</span> had yielded to the gentle treatment of charity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The contention was so sharp (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>More correctly, there arose a sharp contention.
