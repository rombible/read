This in itself was a proof of his interest in the mission-work among the Gentiles, and no one, perhaps, could be found so well fitted to fill the place of Barnabas. He too had the gift of prophetic utterance, and, as we have seen (Note on <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>), was probably able to speak as one who had followed the Lord Jesus, and could bear witness of the Resurrection.<p><span class= "bld">Being recommended by the brethren.</span>—See Note on <a href="/acts/14-26.htm" title="And there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.">Acts 14:26</a>.

It does not follow from the historian's silence that Barnabas was not so recommended, too; for this is the last mention of Barnabas in the history, whose sole object now is to relate the proceedings of Paul. Nor does it seem quite fair (with De Wette, Meyer, Howson, Alford, Hacket, Webster and Wilkinson, &c.) to conclude from this that the Church at Antioch took that marked way of showing their sympathy with Paul in opposition to Barnabas.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The favour of God, as <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/14-26.htm" title="And there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.">Acts 14:26</a></span>, which the wisest and holiest men stand in need of in all their undertakings; as also his gracious conduct and assistance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Paul chose Silas,....
