"He did not go with them to <span class="accented">the work"</span> to which God called them, as he ought to have done. The whole phrase, too, which follows is strongly worded.

One would infer that this passage was penned by Luke before the reconciliation which appears in <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, and that we have here an indication of the early date of the publication of "The Acts." Perhaps also there is an indication in the narrative, coupled with Mark's subsequent attach-merit to Peter, that Mark rather leant at this time to Judaizing views, and that his previous departure "from the work" was partly owing to a want of complete sympathy with St. Paul's doctrine. St. Paul would have no half-hearted helper in his grand and arduous work. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Him (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., that one.
