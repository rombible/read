And what else ought to be the grand and constant inquiry in every ecclesiastical visitation? As the apostle could not but be sensible of the great danger in which the Gentile converts, in distant countries, were of being perverted by the Jews, and as his zeal for the purity of the gospel would lead him to consider by what means they might most probably be confirmed in the truth, it is likely that another end which he had in view in proposing this journey was, to make these Gentiles acquainted with the decrees which had been ordained by the apostles, elders, and brethren in Judea. For no expedient could appear to him more proper than this, to preserve them from being misled. Accordingly, as we find chap. <a href="/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>, he and his fellow-traveller delivered these decrees to them as they went through the cities.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:36-41 Here we have a private quarrel between two ministers, no less than Paul and Barnabas, yet made to end well.

("Reader, how stands it with thee?") [Bengel]. "Paul felt that he was not called to spend a peaceful, though laborious life at Antioch, but that his true work was far off among the Gentiles." We notice here, for the first time, a trace of that tender solicitude for his converts, that earnest longing to see their faces, which appears in the letters which he wrote afterwards, as one of the most remarkable and attractive features of his character. He thought, doubtless, of the Pisidians and Lycaonians, as he thought afterwards at Athens and Corinth of the Thessalonians, from whom he had been lately "taken in presence, not in heart, night and day praying exceedingly that he might see their face and perfect that which was lacking in their faith" [Howson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is not enough that they had sown good seed, but they must take care lest it be plucked up, and tares sown in the stead of it, by the wicked one, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/13-19.htm" title="When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart.
