In the presence of Agrippa, St. Paul does not shrink from speaking of them as the “holy ones” of God’s people Israel—what the Chasidim, or “devout ones” (the “Assideans” of <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/7-13.htm" title="Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:">1 Maccabees 7:13</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-6.htm" title="Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.">2 Maccabees 14:6</a>) had been in an earlier generation.<p><span class= "bld">When they were put to death.</span>—The history of the Acts records only one instance.

He was breathing an atmosphere of “slaughter” (<a href="/acts/9-1.htm" title="And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,">Acts 9:1</a>). On this view, the language of <a href="/hebrews/12-4.htm" title="You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.">Hebrews 12:4</a>, “ye have not yet resisted unto blood,” must be referred to the sufferings of a later time, or. more probably, of a different region.

Agrippa was well versed in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, therefore could the better judge as to the controversy about Jesus being the Messiah. Surely ministers may expect, when they preach the faith of Christ, to be heard patiently. Paul professes that he still kept to all the good in which he was first educated and trained up. See here what his religion was. He was a moralist, a man of virtue, and had not learned the arts of the crafty, covetous Pharisees; he was not chargeable with any open vice and profaneness. He was sound in the faith. He always had a holy regard for the ancient promise made of God unto the fathers, and built his hope upon it. The apostle knew very well that all this would not justify him before God, yet he knew it was for his reputation among the Jews, and an argument that he was not such a man as they represented him to be. Though he counted this but loss, that he might win Christ, yet he mentioned it when it might serve to honour Christ. See here what Paul's religion is; he has not such zeal for the ceremonial law as he had in his youth; the sacrifices and offerings appointed by that, are done away by the great Sacrifice which they typified. Of the ceremonial cleansings he makes no conscience, and thinks the Levitical priesthood is done away in the priesthood of Christ; but, as to the main principles of his religion, he is as zealous as ever. Christ and heaven, are the two great doctrines of the gospel; that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. These are the matter of the promise made unto the fathers. The temple service, or continual course of religious duties, day and night, was kept up as the profession of faith in the promise of eternal life, and in expectation of it. The prospect of eternal life should engage us to be diligent and stedfast in all religious exercises. Yet the Sadducees hated Paul for preaching the resurrection; and the other Jews joined them, because he testified that Jesus was risen, and was the promised Redeemer of Israel. Many things are thought to be beyond belief, only because the infinite nature and perfections of Him that has revealed, performed, or promised them, are overlooked. Paul acknowledged, that while he continued a Pharisee, he was a bitter enemy to Christianity. This was his character and manner of life in the beginning of his time; and there was every thing to hinder his being a Christian. Those who have been most strict in their conduct before conversion, will afterwards see abundant reason for humbling themselves, even on account of things which they then thought ought to have been done.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which thing I also did ... - <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>.<p>And many of the saints ... - Many Christians, <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>.<p>And when they were put to death - In the history of those transactions, there is no account of any Christian being put to death except Stephen, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.

The state of affairs which rendered the murder of St. Stephen possible in the capital would easily account for similar acts of outrage in other places, so that there is no need to suppose with Weiss that the notice here is unhistorical.—<span class="greekheb">κατήνεγκα ψῆφον</span>: “I gave my vote,” R.V., the <span class="greekheb">ψῆφος</span>, literally the pebble used in voting, <span class="ital">calculum defero</span> sc. <span class="ital">in urnam</span> (Grimm), <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, <span class="ital">addo calculum, approbo, cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ψῆφον φέρειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπιφ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">ἐκφ</span>. If the phrase is taken quite literally, it is said to denote the vote of a judge, so that Paul must have been a member of the Sanhedrim, and gave his vote for the death of St. Stephen and other Christians. On the other hand the phrase is sometimes taken as simply = <span class="greekheb">συνευδοκεῖν τῇ ἀναιρέσει</span> (so amongst recent writers, Knabenbauer), <a href="/acts/22-20.htm" title="And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.">Acts 22:20</a>. (C. and H. think that if not a member of the Sanhedrim at the time of Stephen’s death, he was elected soon after, whilst Weiss holds that if the expression does not imply that the writer represents Paul by mistake as a member of the Sanhedrim, it can only be understood as meaning that by his testimony Paul gave a decisive weight to the verdict in condemnation of the Christians.) Certainly it seems, as Bethge urges, difficult to suppose that Paul was a member of such an august body as the Sanhedrim, not only on account of his probable age at the time of his conversion, but also because of his comparatively obscure circumstances. The Sanhedrim was an assembly of aristocrats, composed too of men of mature years and marked influence, and the question may be asked how Saul of Tarsus, who may not even have had a stated residence in the Holy City, could have found a place in the ranks of an assembly numbering the members of the high priestly families and the principal men of Judæa: see <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, June, 1897, and also for the bearing of the statement on the question of Paul’s marriage, with Hackett’s note, <span class="ital">in loco</span>. For the voting in the Sanhedrim see Schürer, div. ii., vol. i., p. 194. E.T. Rendall, p. 336, meets the difficulty above by referring the expression under discussion to a kind of popular vote confirming the sentence of the court against Stephen, for which he finds support in the language of the law and in the narrative of the proto-martyr’s condemnation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem</span>] Saul must have been a most active and prominent agent in the work of persecution in Jerusalem, for we learn here that the death of Stephen was not the only one for which he had given his vote. He had also had the warrant of the chief priests for other arrests beside those he intended to make in Damascus. We can see that the slaughter of the Christians was not in all cases the result of a sudden outburst of rage at some act or speech, but that some of them were imprisoned, then subjected to a form of trial, and afterwards put to death as men condemned by law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/26.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/26-10.htm" title="Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.">Acts 26:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῶν ἁγίων</span>, <span class="ital">of the saints</span>) So he terms the Christians, in a manner appropriate to the beginning of his speech, using a term transferred to them from the Jews.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="ital">I</span>) Emphasis.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν</span>) The article signifies that Paul could not have done this without <span class="ital">the power</span> (the authority); and that the chief priests gave a general power (authority) to all who wished to persecute.—<span class="greekheb">κατήνεγκα ψῆφον</span>) A rare phrase.
