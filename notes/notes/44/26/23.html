The great body of the Jews had fixed their thoughts only on the prophetic visions of the glories of the Messiah’s kingdom. Even the disciples of Jesus were slow to receive any other thought than that of conquest and triumph. Peter’s “Be it far from thee, Lord” (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a>) expressed the horror with which the thought of a suffering Christ at first struck him. It was not till they were led, after the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, into our Lord’s own school of prophetic interpretation (<a href="/context/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25-26</a>; <a href="/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and taught to recognise the under-current of types and prophecies that pointed to a righteous Sufferer, as well as to a righteous King, that they were able to receive the truth. So it was that a “Christ crucified” was still “to the Jews a stumbling-block” (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1Corinthians 1:23</a>). The speech at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="/context/acts/13-27.htm" title="For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.">Acts 13:27-35</a>) may be noted as showing the stress which St. Paul laid on this point. The Greek has “if” in both clauses where the English has “that;” but our idiom scarcely admits of its being so translated.<p><span class= "bld">That he should be the first that should rise from the dead.</span>—More literally, <span class= "ital">that He first by His</span> <span class= "ital">resurrection from the dead</span> (strictly, <span class= "ital">out of His resurrection</span>) <span class= "ital">should show light.</span> It was through the Resurrection only that the hopes of Simeon were fulfilled (<a href="/luke/2-32.htm" title="A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.">Luke 2:32</a>), and that light shone in on those who had been sitting as in the shadow of death. The “people” are, as almost always when the word is so used, God’s people Israel, as distinguished from the heathen.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:12-23 Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christ both to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That Christ - That the Messiah expected by the Jews should be a suffering Messiah.<p>Should suffer - Should lead a painful life, and be put to death.

This cannot mean that the Messiah would be the first dead person who should be restored to life, for Elijah had raised the son of the Shunammite, and Jesus himself had raised Lazarus, and the widow's son at Nain. It does not mean that he would be the first in the order of time that should rise, but first in eminence; the most distinguished, the chief, the head of those who should rise from the dead - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  pro&#772;tos ex anastaseo&#772;s nekro&#772;n.

In <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a> he is called "the first fruits of them that slept. This declaration is therefore made of him by way of eminence:<p>(1) As being chief, a prince among those raised from the dead;<p>(2) As being raised by his own power <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>;<p>(3) As, by his rising, securing a dominion over death and the grave <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-26</a>; and,<p>(4) As bringing, by his rising, life and immortality to light.

Great afflictions in soul and body, and death itself; this is recorded by Moses, <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> and is the sense of many of the types, as of the passover, brazen serpent, &amp;c. and of all the sacrifices which from God were appointed by him, and is the constant account of all the prophets from the beginning to the end; see <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a> <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>. The sufferer is Christ, or the Messiah, not the Father, nor the Spirit, but the Word, or Son of God, and not in his divine nature, which was incapable of suffering, but in his human nature; though sufferings may be ascribed to his whole person, both natures being united in him: and hence they became efficacious to answer the purposes for which they were endured; and which he endured, not for himself, nor for angels, but for chosen men, sinners, and ungodly persons; in order to make peace and reconciliation for them, procure the pardon of their sins, obtain eternal redemption for them, deliver them from all evil, and from all enemies, and bring them nigh to God: and what he suffered were no other than what had been foretold in the writings of the Old Testament, which all along represent the Messiah as a suffering one; and in particular that he should suffer in his character, be reproached, and accounted a worm, and no man, <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> and in his soul and body, and be put to death and buried, as the above prophecies referred to show; the several circumstances leading on to, or attending his sufferings and death, are distinctly expressed; as the betraying him by one of his disciples, selling him for thirty pieces of silver, his being forsaken by all his disciples, his crucifixion between two thieves, the parting of his garments, giving him gall and vinegar to drink, and the piercing his side with a spear, <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>. And to this agreed the doctrine of the apostle, who taught that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ that was to come, and that he had suffered all that Moses and the prophets did say should come upon him: but these were not the present sentiments of the Jews, who expected the Messiah to be a temporal Prince and Saviour, and to live in great outward prosperity, and for ever. <p>And that he should be the first that should rise from the dead: by his own power, and to an immortal life, as Jesus did; and so is the firstborn from the dead, and the first fruits of them that slept: a type of this, in the deliverance of Isaac, is recorded by Moses in <a href="/genesis/22-12.htm">Genesis 22:12</a> compared with <a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a> and the thing itself is foretold by many of the prophets, <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>. <p>and should show light unto the people, and to the Gentiles: in his own person to the people of the Jews, and by his apostles to the Gentiles.

But the same dialogue, c. 90, enables us to realise that even where the idea of a suffering Messiah was entertained, nothing was more abhorrent than the idea of the cross as the outward expression of such sufferings: “If the Messiah can suffer,” cries the Jew Trypho, “yet he cannot be crucified; he cannot die such a shameful, dishonourable death”.

The Vulgate renders it by <span class="accented">passibilis.</span> The Fathers (Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr) contrast the state of Christ in glory with his state in the flesh by the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "impassible" and "passible." <span class="cmt_word">That he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim</span>, etc. Most commentators, from Chrysostom downwards, connect the first with the resurrection. "First from the resurrection," equal to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>).

The A.V. gives the sense by a periphrasis; only it must be well understood that it was especially by being the first to rise, and so to bring life and immortality to light, that Christ showed light to the people. The words may, of course, be construed as the R.V. does, but such a rendering is not in accordance with the spirit of the passage or the analogy of other passages. Christ was the first rise, and he will be followed by them that are his. But it is not true to say that he was the first to give light to Jews and Gentiles, and will be followed by others doing the same. (For the sentiment, setup. <a href="/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>.) Note on the whole the enormous stress laid by St. Paul on the fulfillment of prophecy as a proof of the truth of the gospel, following therein our Lord himself (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 27, 44, 45</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/26.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>That Christ should suffer (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Rather, if or whether the Messiah is liable to suffering.
