(Comp. Note on <a href="/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a>.) The relative “whom” probably refers to the latter of the two nouns rather than to both. In the Greek word for “send” (<span class= "ital">apostello</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>we find the warrant for St. Paul’s claim to be considered an Apostle “not of men, neither by man,” but by the direct personal call of the Lord Jesus (<a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>). The word that had been used of the Twelve (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>) was used also of him; and the pronoun “<span class= "ital">I</span>” is specially emphasised.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:12-23 Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christ both to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Delivering thee from the people - From the Jewish people. This implied that he would be persecuted by them, and that the Lord Jesus would interpose to rescue him.<p>And from the Gentiles - This also implied that he would be persecuted and opposed by them - a prospect which was verified by the whole course of his ministry. Yet in all he experienced, according to the promise, the support and the protection of the Lord Jesus. This was expressed in a summary manner in <a href="/luke/9-16.htm">Luke 9:16</a>.<p>Unto whom now I send thee - <a href="/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>. As the opposition of the Jews arose mainly from the fact that he had gone among the Gentiles, it was important to bring this part of his commission into full view before Agrippa, and to show that the same Saviour who had miraculously converted him had commanded him to go and preach to them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

But how is this performed? And where is the promise? St. Paul was sorely persecuted by the Jews, and at last put to death by the Gentiles. But so long as it would be a mercy, and a true deliverance to Paul, God wrought many such for him; and that, rather than fail, miraculously too; no chains, no iron gates could detain him. When he had finished his course, and done the work he was sent for, it would not have been a deliverance, to have been kept longer from his reward, and the prize he had ran for. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Delivering thee from the people,.... That is, the people of the Jews, as they are distinguished from the Gentiles; and so the Syriac version, and two of Beza's copies, and two of Stephens's, read; for the Lord knew, that as soon as ever Saul was converted and professed his name, and preached his Gospel, the people of the Jews would immediately become his implacable enemies, and seek to destroy him; wherefore he promises him before hand deliverance, and security from them: <p>and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee; to both Jews and Gentiles; to the Jews first, and then to the Gentiles; which method the apostle observed, and which course he steered, until the Jews put away the Gospel from them; and then he turned to the Gentiles, to whom he chiefly preached, as their apostle, and was saved from many dangers among them, as is here promised. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/26.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/26-17.htm" title="Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,">Acts 26:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξαιρούμενός σε</span>: “delivering,” A. and R.V.

Blass renders it as above, and points out that there is no reason for rendering it “choosing” in this one passage, a sense which is not at all fitted to the context; for the language <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_chronicles/16-35.htm" title="And say you, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.">1 Chronicles 16:35</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm" title="Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with you to deliver you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 1:8</a>, so Wendt (1899, but in the sense below previously), Weiss, Felten, Hackett, Bethge, Knabenbauer. It is no objection to say that Paul was not delivered, but was persecuted all his life long, for he was delivered in the sense of deliverance to proclaim the message for which he was sent as an Apostle. On the other hand Overbeck, Rendall, Page, so C. and H. take it in the sense of “choosing,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος ἐκλογῆς</span>. Grimm-Thayer is doubtful. Rendall urges that the word cannot mean “delivering” without some phrase such as <span class="greekheb">ἐκ χειρός</span>, as common in the LXX, but <span class="ital">cf.</span> on the other hand LXX, <a href="/judges/10-15.htm" title="And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to you; deliver us only, we pray you, this day.">Jdg 10:15</a>; <a href="/judges/18-28.htm" title="And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob.

The phrase would certainly sound strange to him as a description of his own position. Rendall also objects that in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-35.htm" title="And say you, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.">1 Chronicles 16:35</a> the word means to gather the scattered exiles from among the heathen as the context shows, but the Hebrew verb <span class="greekheb">נָצַל</span> means to deliver, and is so rendered, <span class="ital">l. c.</span>, in A. and R. V. It is also urged that <span class="greekheb">λαός</span> is always the name of honour, and that elsewhere the enemies of the Apostle were named <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖοι</span>; but not only is the collocation “the people and the Gentiles” a common one, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/26-23.htm" title="That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.">Acts 26:23</a>, <a href="/romans/15-10.htm" title="And again he said, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.">Romans 15:10</a>, but <span class="greekheb">λαός</span> is used of the unbelieving Jews in describing hostility to the Gospel, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/4-27.htm" title="For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,">Acts 4:27</a>, <a href="/acts/12-4.htm" title="And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.">Acts 12:4</a>.
