And no wonder: he saw that nature did not act in Paul; but the grace that acted in him he did not see.

Doubtless, Paul had a great deal more to say in defence of the gospel which he preached, and for the honour of it, and to recommend it to the good opinion of his noble audience. He had just fallen upon a subject that was the life of the cause in which he was engaged, the death and resurrection of Jesus: and here he was in his element, his soul was animated, his mouth was opened toward them, and his heart enlarged: and it is a thousand pities that he should have been interrupted, as he now was, and not permitted to say all he designed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:24-32 It becomes us, on all occasions, to speak the words of truth and soberness, and then we need not be troubled at the unjust censures of men. Active and laborious followers of the gospel often have been despised as dreamers or madmen, for believing such doctrines and such wonderful facts; and for attesting that the same faith and diligence, and an experience like their own, are necessary to all men, whatever their rank, in order to their salvation. But apostles and prophets, and the Son of God himself, were exposed to this charge; and none need be moved thereby, when Divine grace has made them wise unto salvation. Agrippa saw a great deal of reason for Christianity. His understanding and judgment were for the time convinced, but his heart was not changed. And his conduct and temper were widely different from the humility and spirituality of the gospel. Many are almost persuaded to be religious, who are not quite persuaded; they are under strong convictions of their duty, and of the excellence of the ways of God, yet do not pursue their convictions. Paul urged that it was the concern of every one to become a true Christian; that there is grace enough in Christ for all. He expressed his full conviction of the truth of the gospel, the absolute necessity of faith in Christ in order to salvation. Such salvation from such bondage, the gospel of Christ offers to the Gentiles; to a lost world. Yet it is with much difficulty that any person can be persuaded he needs a work of grace on his heart, like that which was needful for the conversion of the Gentiles. Let us beware of fatal hesitation in our own conduct; and recollect how far the being almost persuaded to be a Christian, is from being altogether such a one as every true believer is.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Festus said with a loud voice - Amazed at the zeal of Paul. Paul doubtless evinced deep interest in the subject, and great earnestness in the delivery of his defense.<p>Thou art beside thyself - Thou art deranged; thou art insane. The reasons why Festus thought Paul mad were, probably:<p>(1) His great earnestness and excitement on the subject.<p>(2) his laying such stress on the gospel of the despised Jesus of Nazareth, as if it were a matter of infinite moment. Festus despised it; and he regarded it as proof of derangement that so much importance was attached to it.<p>(3) Festus regarded, probably, the whole story of the vision that Paul said had appeared to him as the effect of an inflamed and excited imagination, and as a proof of delirium. This is not an uncommon charge against those who are Christians, and especially when they evince unusual zeal. Sinners regard them as under the influence of delirium and fanaticism; as terrified by imaginary and superstitious fears; or as misguided by fanatical leaders. Husbands often thus think their wives to be deranged, and parents perceive their children that, and wicked people assume the ministers of the gospel to be crazy. The frivolous think it proof of derangement that others are serious, anxious, and prayerful; the rich, that others are willing to part with their property to do good; the ambitious and worldly, that others are willing to leave their country and home to go among the Gentiles to spend their lives in making known the unsearchable riches of Christ. The really sober and rational part of the world they who fear God and keep his commandments; they who believe that eternity is before them, and who strive to live for it - are thus charged with insanity by those who are really deluded, and who are thus living lives of madness and folly. The tenants of a madhouse often think all others deranged but themselves; but there is no madness so great, no delirium so awful, as to neglect the eternal interest of the soul for the sake of the pleasures and honors which this life can give.<p>Much learning - It is probable that Festus was acquainted with the fact that Paul was a learned man. Paul had not, while before him, manifested particularly his learning. But Festus, acquainted in some way with the fact that he was well-educated, supposed that his brain had been turned, and that the effect of it was seen by devotion to a fanatical form of religion. The tendency of long-continued and intense application to produce mental derangement is everywhere known.<p>Doth make thee mad - Impels, drives, or excites thee &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  peritrepei to madness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Festus said with a loud voice&#8212;surprised and bewildered.<p>Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad&#8212;"is turning thy head." The union of flowing Greek, deep acquaintance with the sacred writings of his nation, reference to a resurrection and other doctrines to a Roman utterly unintelligible, and, above all, lofty religious earnestness, so strange to the cultivated, cold-hearted skeptics of that day&#8212;may account for this sudden exclamation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou art beside thyself; </span> this was the opinion of Festus concerning Paul, and such is the opinion of carnal and worldly men concerning such as are truly godly; as the prophet who came to Jehu was counted a <span class="ital">mad fellow, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_kings/9-11.htm" title="Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you?

Paul is reckoned to have been skilful in the Hebrew, Syriac, Greek, and Latin tongues; to have been well read in the poets; and certainly he was an excellent orator, as appears all along in his defence he made for his doctrine, and his life: but there was yet somewhat more than all this; Festus might feel a more than ordinary effect from Paul’s words, and not knowing of the Spirit by which he spake did attribute it to his learning, or madness, or to any thing but the true cause of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as he thus spake for himself,.... Asserting the integrity and innocence of his past life and conversation, in proof of which he appealed to the Jews themselves; setting forth the prejudices to the Christian religion he had been under; declaring the heavenly vision that had appeared to him, and the divine orders he had received; alleging, that in his ministry there was an entire harmony between him, and the writings of Moses, and the prophets, for which the Jews professed a veneration; as he was thus vindicating himself, ere he had well finished his apology, <p>Festus said with a loud voice; that all might hear, and being moved with resentment at what he had heard; and it may be, he was displeased with Paul that he took so much notice of Agrippa, and so often addressed him, and appealed to him, when he scarce ever turned to, or looked at him: <p>Paul, thou art beside thyself; not in thy senses, or right mind, to talk of such an appearance and vision, and especially of the resurrection of a person from the dead. This is no unusual thing for the ministers of the Gospel to be reckoned madmen, and the doctrines they preach madness and folly: our Lord himself was said to be beside himself, and to have a devil, and be mad; and so were his apostles, <a href="/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21</a> and it is not to be wondered at that natural men should entertain such an opinion of them, since what they deliver is quite out of their sphere and reach: Festus added, <p>much learning doth make thee mad; the apostle was a man of much learning, both Jewish, Greek, and Roman; and Festus perceived him to be of great reading by his making mention of Moses, and the prophets, writings which he knew nothing at all of. And as this sometimes is the case, that much reading, and hard study, do cause men to be beside themselves, he thought it was Paul's case: so the philosopher (f) suggests, that men of great wit and learning, and who are closely engaged in study, whether in philosophy, or politics, or poetry, or in technical affairs, are inclined to be melancholy, and phrenetic. <p>(f) Aristotel.

As the same word is taken up in the following verse, it is better that it should be rendered alike in both places.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">much learning doth make thee mad</span>] Lit. (with <span class="ital">R. V.</span>) “doth turn thee to madness.” But there is nothing gained by construing thus, and much is lost in English vigour. “Much learning” is literally “the many writings.” As in <a href="/john/7-15.htm" title="And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?">John 7:15</a>, where the same word is rendered “letters,” it may mean study and learning generally. But it seems better to take it of those writings (viz. the Old Testament) to which Paul had been appealing. For as a religious literature no nation, not even the polished Greeks, had anything to place in comparison with the Sacred Books of the Jews.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/26.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μαίνῃ Παῦλε</span>, <span class="ital">thou art mad, Paul</span>) It is thou, Festus, who art mad. Festus saw that it is not nature which acts in Paul: he was not capable of seeing grace: wherefore he supposes that it was a Jewish kind of enthusiastic phrensy, of the same kind as was that among the Gentiles, according to their own fables. He does not ascribe to Paul habitual madness, but a particular act and feeling of madness then: comp. ch. <a href="/acts/12-15.htm" title="And they said to her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.">Acts 12:15</a>.—<span class="greekheb">γράμματα</span>, <span class="ital">learning</span>) Festus accounts the apostle’s ardour as the effect of overmuch learning [Pedantry].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- Made his</span> defense for <span class="accented">spake for himself</span>, A.V.

So <a href="/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>, "How knoweth this man letters (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)?" is equivalent to Whence hath this man this wisdom?

The excited interruption by Festus shows that he was unable to accept the truths enunciated by the apostle. The ideas of fulfilled prophecy, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of a crucified Jew giving light to the great Roman world, were" foolishness unto him," because he lacked spiritual discernment. He thought the apostle's glowing words must be the outcome of a disordered mind. <span class="cmt_word">Turn thee to madness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>).
