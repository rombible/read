The one unpardonable sin, in their eyes, was that he taught the Gentiles that they might claim every gift and grace which had once been looked on as the privilege and prerogative of Israel. The historical precedence of the Jew remained (see Notes on <a href="/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="/context/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?">Romans 3:1-2</a>), but in all essential points they were placed on a footing of equality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/26-21.htm" title="For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me....">Acts 26:21-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">For these causes </span>— And for no other; <span class="ital">the Jews </span>— Who have the same inveteracy against the gospel of Jesus that I once had; <span class="ital">caught </span>(seized) <span class="ital">me in the temple, and went about </span>(attempted) <span class="ital">to kill me </span>— <span class="greekheb">Διαχειρισασθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to kill me with their own hands. </span>So the word properly signifies; but, <span class="ital">having obtained help of God </span>— By the protection and care of his watchful providence; <span class="ital">I continue unto this day </span>— Am still preserved and upheld, and employ my spared life to the purposes for which it is prolonged; <span class="ital">witnessing both to small and great </span>— What is really a matter of infinite concern, both to the meanest and most exalted of mankind, the gospel of Christ, and the way of salvation for lost sinners through him; <span class="ital">saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say</span> — Advancing no new doctrine whatever; <span class="ital">that Christ should suffer </span>— Not only be a man, and therefore should be capable of suffering, but that, as Messiah, he should be appointed to suffer; and that his sufferings and ignominious death should not only be consistent with, but pursuant of, his undertaking. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and Paul’s preaching it was one great thing that exasperated them; but Paul adheres to that doctrine, and insists that, in preaching it, he preached the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions; and that therefore they ought not only not to be offended at what he preached, but to believe, and embrace it with all their hearts. <span class="ital">And that he should be the first that should rise from the dead — </span>Namely, to an immortal life; the first that should rise to die no more, opening, as it were, the womb of the grave to all the pious dead who should rise after him, and none of whom could have risen, if he had not risen first. Accordingly, to show that the resurrection of all believers is in virtue of his resurrection, just when he rose, many dead bodies of the saints arose, and went into the holy city, <a href="/matthew/27-53.htm" title="And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.">Matthew 27:53</a>. <span class="ital">And should show light unto the people </span>— The Jews in the first place, for he was to be the glory of his people Israel: to them he showed light by himself, and then to the Gentiles by the ministry of his apostles; for he was to be a light to lighten them who sat in darkness. In this Paul refers to his commission, <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>. He rose from the dead on purpose that he might show light to Jews and Gentiles; that he might give a convincing proof of the truth of his doctrine, and might send it with so much the greater power among both descriptions of persons. All this was foretold by the Old Testament prophets; and what was there in it that the Jews could justly be displeased at?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:12-23 Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christ both to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Caught me in the temple - <a href="/acts/21-30.htm">Acts 21:30</a>.<p>And went about ... - Endeavored to put me to death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. showed &#8230; to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem&#8212;omitting Arabia; because, beginning with the Jews, his object was to mention first the places where his former hatred of the name of Christ was best known: the mention of the Gentiles, so unpalatable to his audience, is reserved to the last.<p>repent and return to God, and do works meet for repentance&#8212;a brief description of conversion and its proper fruits, suggested, probably, by the Baptist's teaching (Lu 3:7, 8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By violent hands and indirect means, as we see, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/21-31.htm" title="And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.">Acts 21:31</a></span>, and as they had done unto our Saviour, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a></span>, where the same word is used. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple,....
