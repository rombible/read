He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-15.

And he said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.">Acts 26:15</a>. Evidently the following verses contain a summary of what in the other two accounts of the Conversion is spoken to Paul by Ananias, and revealed by the Lord in a vision, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>, <a href="/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a> (so Alford, Felten, Zöckler). This is far more satisfactory than to suppose that the two narratives in 9 and 22 are really dependent upon 26, the author having employed in them an oral tradition relating to Ananias, without being at all aware that by introducing such an account he was really contradicting a point upon which Paul lays special stress, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the fact that he had received his apostleship neither from man nor through man, <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a> (so Wendt (1899), p. 189, and McGiffert, pp. 120 and 355). But in the first place nothing is said as to the Apostle receiving his Apostleship from Ananias; he receives recovery of sight from him, but his call to his Apostleship commences with his call before Damascus: “epocha apostolatus Paulini cum hoc ipso conversionis articulo incipit,” Bengel; and see specially Beyschlag, <span class="ital">Studien und Kritiken</span>, p. 220, 1864, on <a href="/galatians/1-15.htm" title="But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,">Galatians 1:15</a> (<span class="ital">Witness of the Epistles</span>, p. 379, 1892); and, further, the introduction and omission of Ananias are in themselves strong corroborations of the naturalness of the three accounts of the Conversion. Thus in chap. 22, <a href="/acts/26-12.htm" title="Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,">Acts 26:12</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/9-10.htm" title="And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10</a>, “non conveniebat in hunc locum uberior de An. narratio, <a href="/acts/9-10.htm" title="And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10</a> ff., sed conveniebat præconium ejus, quod non est illic” (Blass); so too it was natural and important to emphasise before a Jewish audience the description of Ananias (in <a href="/acts/9-10.htm" title="And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10</a> he is simply <span class="greekheb">τις μαθητής</span>) as <span class="greekheb">εὐλαβὴς κατὰ τὸν κόμον</span>, well reported of by all the <span class="ital">Jews</span>, whereas in 26 “tota persona Ananiæ sublata est, quippe quæ non esset apta apud hos auditores” (Blass). The three narratives agree in the main facts (see notes in comment., and Zöckler, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, 2nd edit., p. 216), and “the slight variations in the three accounts do not seem to be of any consequence,” Ramsay, <span class="ital">Saint Paul</span>, p. 379, <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Renan, <span class="ital">Apostles</span>, p. 13, E.T., Salmon, <span class="ital">Introd.</span>, p. 121. Clemen, who agrees in the main with Wendt in regarding 26 as the original narrative, refers chap. 9 to his Redactor Antijudaicus, and chap. 22 to his Redactor Judaicus; he sees evidences of the hand of the former in 9, 10, 15, 17, and of the latter in <a href="/acts/22-12.htm" title="And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelled there,">Acts 22:12</a>; <a href="/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a>. If <a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a> f., and the words in <a href="/acts/26-15.htm" title="And I said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.">Acts 26:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς πάντας ἀνθρώπους</span>, do not fit in with this theory, they are ascribed by Clemen to the later Redactor Antijudaicus; but the latter expression <span class="greekheb">πρὸς π</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθ</span>. is already contained in the meaning of the original source, <a href="/acts/26-17.htm" title="Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,">Acts 26:17</a>; <a href="/acts/26-20.htm" title="But showed first to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.">Acts 26:20</a> a and c (20b belonging, according to Clemen, to the Redactor Judaicus). Space forbids any further examination of passages in the three narratives with regard to which the partition critics, Clemen and Jüngst, are again hopelessly at variance with each other, but <span class="ital">cf.</span> Jüngst, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, pp. 84, 87, 89, 94, and the strictures of Knabenbauer, <span class="ital">Actus Apostolorum</span>, p. 11 (1899). But it is strange to find that Clemen should be prepared to fall back upon the view of Baur, <span class="ital">Paulus</span>, <a href="/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>, that the narrative of Paul’s blindness was derived from the spiritual blindness referred to in <a href="/acts/26-17.htm" title="Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,">Acts 26:17</a>, and that <span class="ital">therefore</span> this narrative is evidently older than the other accounts in 9 and 22, which introduce a tragical blindness. As Wendt points out, there is no hint in the text that Paul’s blindness was symbolical, and there is nothing to suggest the circumstantial narratives relating to Ananias in the phrase <a href="/acts/26-17.htm" title="Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,">Acts 26:17</a>, which relates not to the Apostle’s own conversion, but to his power of converting others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">Who art thou, Lord</span>] The readiness with which “Lord,” an expression of allegiance, comes to the Apostle’s lips lends probability to the notion that God’s promptings had been working in his heart before, and that the mad rage against “the Way” was an attempt to stifle them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/26.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/26-15.htm" title="And I said, Who are you, Lord?

Paul often refers to the words of the speech which Jesus spake to Saul, as we shall presently observe.
