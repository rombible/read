Afra, Græca, Syra, are familiar examples of like names. “Lydia” occurs, it will be remembered, once and again, in Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 14; iii. 9). Thyatira, one of the cities in the valley of the Lycus, was, like many other towns of Asia Minor, famous for its dyeing works, especially for purple, or crimson, which rivalled the fame of Tyre or Miletus (Strabo, xiii. 4, § 14). Inscriptions found on the spot bear witness to the existence of a guild, or corporation, of purple-sellers, with which Lydia doubtless was connected. In <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.">Revelation 1:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-18.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things said the Son of God, who has his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;">Revelation 2:18</a>, it appears as one of the seven churches to which special epistles were to be sent from their divine Head. It had been founded as a colony, in the modern sense of the term, from Macedonia, as the sequel of the conquest of the Persian monarchy by Alexander the Great, and this may in part explain Lydia’s presence at Philippi. The fact that she, and not her husband, is named as the purple-seller, is at least presumptive evidence that she was carrying on the business by herself.<p><span class= "bld">Which worshipped God.</span>—She was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a proselyte (see Note on <a href="/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>), and, as the sequel shows, one of the better type, drawn to Judaism, not by superstitious fear, or weak credulity, but by the higher ethical and spiritual teaching which it presented.<p><span class= "bld">Heard.</span>—For “heard” read <span class= "ital">was listening.</span><p><span class= "bld">Whose heart the Lord opened.</span>—The scene is one which might well call for the master touches of a great painter.

We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A seller of purple - Purple was a most valuable color, obtained usually from shellfish.

Whether this woman was a Jewess or a Gentile, is not certain, her name will not determine; she might be called so from the country of Lydia, which was in Asia minor, and where was Thyatira, her native place; Horace makes frequent mention of one of this name (g) and it might be a Jewish name; we read of R. Simeon ben Lydia (h); and as these seem to be Jewish women that met at this oratory, she might be one: <p>a seller of purple; either of purple silks, much wore in the eastern countries; or of the purple dye, which in, <p>"Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great riches.'' (1 Maccabees 4:23) <p>is called "purple of the sea", or "sea purple"; it being the blood or juice of a turbinated shell fish, which the Jews call  "Chalson": this they speak of as a shellfish; hence those words (i), <p>"go and learn of the Chalson, for all the while it grows, its shell grows with it:'' <p>and that purple was dyed with the blood of it, appears from the following instances; "the best fruits in the land", <a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a> are interpreted (k), the things that are the most famous in the world, as the Chalson, &amp;c. with whose blood, as the gloss on the passage says, they dye purple: and the purple dyed with this was very valuable, and fetched a good price; the tribe of Zebulun is represented (l), as complaining to God, that he had given to their brethren fields and vineyards, to them mountains and hills, to their brethren lands, and to them seas and rivers; to which it is replied, all will stand in need of thee, because of Chalson; as it is said, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a> "They shall suck of the abundance of the seas"; the gloss upon it, interpreting the word Chalson, is, it comes out of the sea to the mountains, and with its blood they dye purple, which is sold at a very dear price. The text in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a> is thus paraphrased by Jonathan the Targumist; <p>"at the shore of the sea they dwell (i.e. they of the tribe of Zebulun), and they delight themselves with (the fish) Tuny, and take Chalson, and with its blood dye purple the threads of their garments.'' <p>And so Maimonides says (m), that they use this in dying the fringes on the borders of their garments; after they have scoured the wool, and the like, that it may take the dye, he says, <p>"they take of the blood of Chalson, which is a fish whose colour is like the colour of purple, and its blood is black like ink, and it is found in the salt sea,'' <p>particularly about Tyre; so the husbandmen in <a href="/jeremiah/52-16.htm">Jeremiah 52:16</a> are interpreted (n), they that catch Chalson from the ladder of Tyre to Chippah, or the shore; the gloss explains it, those that squeeze and press the Chalson, to fetch out its blood: and with all this agree the modern accounts given of purple, as follow; <p>"purple was much esteemed among the ancients, especially the Tyrian purple; which underwent more dyes than the rest, and which was almost peculiar to emperors and kings, yet this purple did not exceed that now in use.--The ancient purple was tinged, or given with the blood or juice of a precious turbinated testaceous sea fish, called by the Greeks  and by the Latins "purpura".--In the seas of the Spanish West Indies, about Nicoya, is found a shell fish, which perfectly resembles the ancient "purpura", and in all probability is the very same--these are gathered very plentifully in the spring, and by rubbing one against another, yield a kind of saliva, or thick glair, resembling soft wax; but the purple dye is in the throat of the fish, and the finest part in a little white vein--the chief riches of Nicoya consist in this fish; cloth of Segovia dyed with it, is sold for twenty crowns the ell.--In the Philosoph. Transact., we have an account of a purple fish discovered in 1686, by Mr. W. Cole, on the coasts of Somersetshire, South Wales, &amp;c, where it is found in great abundance.--The fish is a kind of "buccinum", a name given by the ancients to all fishes, whose shell bears any resemblance to a hunting horn; and it appears from Pliny, that part of the ancient purple was taken from this kind of shell fish. The Caribbee Islands have likewise their "purple" fish; it is called "burgan", being of the size of the end of the finger, and resembling our periwinkles; its shell is of a brownish azure, its flesh white, its intestines of a very bright red, the colour whereof appears through the body; and it is this that dyes that froth, which it casts when taken, and which is at first of a violet hue, bordering on blue; to oblige them to yield the greater quantity of froth, they lay them on a plate, and shake and beat them against one another, upon which the plate is immediately covered with the froth, which is received on a linen cloth, and becomes "purple", in proportion as it dries (o).'' <p>It may be further observed, that the fringes which the Jews wore upon their garments, had on them a ribband of blue or purple, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38</a>, for the word there used, is by the Septuagint rendered "purple", in <a href="/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a> and sometimes "hyacinth"; and the whole fringe was by the Jews called  "purple" :hence it is said (p), <p>"does not everyone that puts on the "purple" (i.e. the fringes on his garments) in Jerusalem, make men to wonder? and a little after, the former saints, or religious men, when they had wove in it (the garment) three parts, they put on it  "the purple".'' <p>And there were persons who traded in these things, and were called , "sellers of purple" (q), as here; that is, for the Tzitzith, or fringes for the borders of the garments, on which the ribband of blue or purple was put, as the gloss explains it: the Jews were very curious about the colour, and the dying of it; that it should be a colour that would hold and not change; and that the ribband be dyed on purpose for that use. Maimonides gives rules for the dying of it (r), and they were no less careful of whom they bought it; for they say, that "the purple" was not to be bought, but of an approved person, or one that was authorized for that purpose (s); and a scruple is raised by one, whether he had done right or no, in buying it of the family of a doctor deceased (t): now since Lydia might be a Jewess, or at least, as appears by what follows, was a proselytess of the Jewish religion, this might be her business to sell the purple for their fringes, and it may be the fringes themselves; and if this was her employment, she was thoroughly a religious person in their way, since we find, that , "sellers of purple", were free from reading <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard <i>us</i>: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</span><p>(8) The Lord opens the heart to hear the word which is preached.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/16-14.htm" title="And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.">Acts 16:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καί τις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">Also a woman was listening</span>, etc. <span class="greekheb">Λυδία</span> was a common female name (Hor. <span class="ital">Od</span>. i. 8, iii. 9, vi. 20), and therefore it remains doubtful whether she received her name “a solo natali” (Grotius, de Wette, and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πορφυρόπωλις</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἡ τὰ πορφυρᾶ</span> (fabrics and clothes dyed purple) <span class="greekheb">πωλοῦσα</span> (Hesychius, Phot. <span class="ital">Bibl</span>. 201. 41).

The expression <span class="greekheb">σεβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸν Θεόν</span> shows that she was “a proselyte of the gate”; she could easily have gained her knowledge of the Jewish religion as she was <span class="greekheb">πόλεως Θυατείρων</span> where a Jewish colony had been planted, and there is reason to believe that the Jews were specially devoted to the dyeing industry for which Thyatira and the Lydian land in general were noted.

Thyatira was in Lydia. Lydian women, from the time of Homer downwards, were famous for their purple dyes; and it appears from an inscription found in Thyatira, that there was there a guild of dyers, called <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (Lewin, 2:214). <span class="cmt_word">One that worshipped God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a proselyte. So in <a href="/acts/13-43.htm">Acts 13:43</a> we find <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> the <span class="accented">devout</span> or <span class="accented">religious</span> proselytes. And so <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="accented">devout</span> women. And so, in <a href="/acts/18-7.htm">Acts 18:7</a>, Justus is described as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> one who worshipped God (see too <a href="/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 17</a>). In <a href="/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a> Cornelius is spoken of as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. It has been suggested that possibly Euodias and Syntyche (<a href="/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>) were of the same class, and converted at the same time as Lydia. There is certainly a coincidence between the mention of the women in ver. 13 and the prominence given to the Philippian women in <a href="/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2, 3</a>. It is well observed by Chrysostom, on the latter part of this verse, "<span class="accented">The</span> opening of the heart was God's work, the attending was hers: so that it was both God's doing and man's" (camp. <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>). <span class="accented">To open</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is applied as here to the heart (2 Macc. 1:4); to the eyes (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>); to the ears (<a href="/mark/7-34.htm">Mark 7:34, 35</a>); to the understanding (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>); to the Scriptures (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>); "Corclausum per se.
