It was the heaviest of all the charges brought by Cicero against Verres, the Governor of Sicily, that he had broken this law: “<span class= "ital">Facinus est vinciri civem Romanum, scelus verberari”</span> (Cic. <span class= "ital">in Verr.</span> v. 57). The words <span class= "ital">civis Romanus sum</span> acted almost like a charm in stopping the violence of provincial magistrates. St. Paul was a citizen by birth (see Note on <a href="/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a>), his father having probably been wealthy enough to buy the <span class= "ital">jus civitatis, </span>which brought with it commercial as well as personal privileges. It did not necessarily involve residence at Rome, but makes it probable that there were some points of contact with the imperial city.<p>There is something like a tone of irony in the “being Romans,” echoing, as it did, the very words of his accusers (<a href="/acts/16-21.htm" title="And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.">Acts 16:21</a>). He, too, could stand on his rights as a citizen. The judges had not called on the prisoners for their defence, had not even questioned them. Even if they had not been citizens the trial was a flagrant breach of justice, and St. Paul wished to make the <span class= "ital">strategi</span> feel that it was so. Here we note that he seems to couple Silas with himself. It is possible, as the Latin form of his name, Silvanus (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 1:1</a>) suggests, that he also was a citizen of Rome, but St. Paul’s mode of speech was natural enough, even on the assumption that he only could claim the privilege. We could hardly expect him to say with minute accuracy: “They have beaten <span class= "ital">us</span> uncondemned, and I, for my part, am a Roman citizen.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:35-40 Paul, though willing to suffer for the cause of Christ, and without any desire to avenge himself, did not choose to depart under the charge of having deserved wrongful punishment, and therefore required to be dismissed in an honourable manner. It was not a mere point of honour that the apostle stood upon, but justice, and not to himself so much as to his cause. And when proper apology is made, Christians should never express personal anger, nor insist too strictly upon personal amends. The Lord will make them more than conquerors in every conflict; instead of being cast down by their sufferings, they will become comforters of their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have beaten us openly uncondemned - There are three aggravating circumstances mentioned, of which Paul complains:<p>(1) That they had been beaten contrary to the Roman laws.<p>(2) that it had been public; the disgrace had been in the presence of the people, and the reparation ought to be as public.<p>(3) that it had been done without a trial, and while they were uncondemned, and therefore the magistrates ought themselves to come and release them, and thus publicly acknowledge their error. Paul knew the privileges of a Roman citizen, and at proper times, when the interests of justice and religion required it, he did not hesitate to assert them. In all this, he understood and accorded with the Roman laws. The Valerian law declared that if a citizen appealed from the magistrate to the people, it should not be lawful for magistrate to beat him with rods, or to behead him (Plutarch, Life of P. Valerius Publicola; Livy, ii. 8). By the Porcian law it was expressly forbidden that a citizen should be beaten (Livy, iv. 9). Cicero says that the body of every Roman citizen was inviolable. "The Porcian law," he adds, "has removed the rod from the body of every Roman citizen." And in his celebrated oration against Verres, he says, A Roman citizen was beaten with rods in the forum, O judges; where, in the meantime, no groan, no other voice of this unhappy man, was heard except the cry, 'I am a Roman citizen'! Take away this hope," he says, "take away this defense from the Roman citizens, let there be no protection in the cry I am a Roman citizen, and the praetor can with impunity inflict any punishment on him who declares himself a citizen of Rome, etc."<p>Being Romans - Being Romans, or having the privilege of Roman citizens. They were born Jews, but they claimed that they were Roman citizens, and had a right to the privileges of citizenship. On the ground of this claim, and the reason why Paul claimed to be a Roman citizen, see the notes on <a href="/acts/22-28.htm">Acts 22:28</a>.<p>Privily - Privately. The release should be as public as the unjust act of imprisonment. As they have publicly attempted to disgrace us, so they should as publicly acquit us. This was a matter of mere justice; and as it was of great importance to their character and success, they insisted on it.<p>Nay, verily; but let them come ... - It was proper that they should be required to do this:<p>(1) Because they had been illegally imprisoned, and the injustice of the magistrates should be acknowledged.<p>(2) because the Roman laws had been violated, and the majesty of the Roman people insulted, and honor should be done to the laws.<p>(3) because injustice had been done to Paul and Silas, and they had a right to demand just treatment and protection.<p>(4) because such a public act on the part of the magistrates would strengthen the young converts, and show them that the apostles were not guilty of a violation of the laws.<p>(5) because it would tend to the honor and to the furtherance of religion. It would be a public acknowledgement of their innocence, and would go far toward lending to them the sanction of the laws as religious teachers. We may learn from this also:<p>(1) That though Christianity requires meekness in the reception of injuries, yet that there are occasions on which Christians may insist on their rights according to the laws. Compare <a href="/john/18-23.htm">John 18:23</a>.<p>(2) that this is to be done particularly where the honor of religion is concerned, and where by it the gospel will be promoted. A Christian may bear much as a man in a private capacity, and may submit, without any effort to seek reparation; but where the honor of the gospel is concerned; where submission, without any effort to obtain justice, might be followed by disgrace to the cause of religion, a higher obligation may require him to seek a vindication of his character, and to claim the protection of the laws. His name, and character, and influence belong to the church. The laws are designed as a protection to an injured name, or of violated property and rights, and of an endangered life. And when that protection can be had only by an appeal to the laws, such an appeal, as in the case of Paul and Silas, is neither vindictive nor improper. My private interests I may sacrifice, if I choose; my public name, and character, and principles belong to the church and the world, and the laws, if necessary, may be called in for their protection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37.

The sergeants, who were present when the jailer reported to Paul the message they came with from the magistrates; though the Syriac version reads in the singular number, "Paul said to him", to the jailer: <p>they have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; what the magistrates ordered to be done to them, is reckoned all one as if they had done it themselves; and which was done "openly", before all the people, in the most public manner; to their great reproach, being put to open shame, as if they had been the most notorious malefactors living; when they were "uncondemned", had done nothing worthy of condemnation, being innocent and without fault, as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render the word; nor was their cause heard, or they suffered to make any defence for themselves; and what was an aggravation of all this, that this was done in a Roman colony, and by Roman magistrates; and to persons that were Romans, at least one of them, Paul, who was of the city of Tarsus: for, according to the Porcian and Sempronian laws, a Roman citizen might neither be bound nor beaten (n); but these magistrates, not content to beat Paul and Silas, without knowing the truth of their case, had cast them into prison as malefactors, and for further punishment: <p>and now do they thrust us out privily? nay, verily; or so it shall not be: this shows, that the apostle was acquainted with the Roman laws, as well as with the rites and customs of the Jews; and acted the wise and prudent, as well as the honest and harmless part; and this he did, not so much for the honour of the Roman name, as for the honour of the Christian name; for he considered, that should he and his companion go out of the prison in such a private manner, it might be taken for granted, that they had been guilty of some notorious offence, and had justly suffered the punishment of the law for it, which would have been a reproach to Christianity, and a scandal to the Gospel: wherefore the apostle refuses to go out in this manner, adding, <p>but let them come themselves, and fetch us out; that by so doing, they might own the illegality of their proceedings, and declare the innocence of the apostles. <p>(n) Cicero orat. 10. in Verrem, l. 5. p. 603. &amp; orat. 18. pro Rabirio, p. 714. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{20}</span> But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast <i>us</i> into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</span><p>(20) We must not render injury for injury, and yet nonetheless it is lawful for us to use such helps as God gives us, to bridle the outrageousness of the wicked, so that they do not hurt others in a similar way.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πρὸς αὐτούς</span>] <span class="ital">to the jailor and the lictors;</span> the latter had thus in the meantime come themselves into the prison.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δείραντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">after they had beaten us publicly without judicial condemnation,—us who are Romans</span>. This sets forth, in terse language precisely embracing the several elements, their treatment as an open violation, partly of the law of nature and nations in general (<span class="greekheb">ἀκατακρίτους</span>, found neither in the LXX. or Apocrypha, nor in Greek writers), partly of the Roman law in particular. For exemption from the disgrace of being scourged by rods and whips was secured to every Roman citizen by the <span class="ital">Lex Valeria</span> in the year 254 U.C. (Liv. ii. 8; Valer. Max. iv. 1; Dion. Hal. v. p. 292), and by the <span class="ital">Lex Porcia</span> in the year 506 U.C. (Liv. x. 9; Cic. <span class="ital">Proverbs Rabir.</span> 4), before every Roman tribunal (comp. Euseb. <span class="ital">H. E.</span> v. 1); therefore Cicero, <span class="ital">in Verr.</span> v. 57, says of the exclamation, <span class="ital">Civis Romanus sum:</span> “saepe multis in ultimis terris opem inter barbaros et salutem tulit.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That <span class="ital">Silas</span> was also a Roman citizen, is rightly inferred from the <span class="ital">plural</span> form of expression, in which there is no reason to find a mere synecdoche. The distinction, which was implied in the bestowal of this privilege, cannot be adduced against the historical character of the narrative (Zeller), as we know not the occasion and circumstances of its acquisition. <span class="ital">But how had Paul</span> (by his birth, <a href="/acts/22-18.htm" title="And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get you quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.">Acts 22:18</a>). <span class="ital">Roman citizenship?</span> Certainly not simply as a native of Tarsus. For Tarsus was neither a <span class="ital">colonia</span> nor a <span class="ital">municipium</span>, but an <span class="ital">urbs libera</span>, to which the privilege of having governing authorities of its own, under the recognition, however, of the Roman supremacy, was given by Augustus after the civil war, as well as other privileges (Dio Chrys. II. p. 36, ed. Reiske), but not Roman citizenship; for this very fact would, least of all, have remained historically unknown, and acquaintance with the origin of the apostle from Tarsus would have protected him from the decree of scourging (see <a href="/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>; comp. with <a href="/acts/22-24.htm" title="The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know why they cried so against him.">Acts 22:24</a> ff.). This much, therefore, only may be surely decided, that his father or a yet earlier ancestor had acquired the privilege of citizenship either as a reward of merit (Suet. <span class="ital">Aug.</span> 47) or by purchase (<a href="/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a>; Dio Cass. lx. 17; Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell. Jud.</span> ii. 14), and had transmitted it to the apostle. According to Zeller’s arbitrary preconceptions, the mention of the Roman citizenship here and in chap. 22. had only the unhistorical purpose in view “of recommending the apostle to the Romans as a native Roman.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν λάθρα ἡμᾶς ἑκβάλλ</span>.] is indignantly opposed to <span class="greekheb">δείραντες ἡμᾶς δημοσίᾳ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἔβαλον εἰς φυλακήν</span>: <span class="ital">and now do they cast us out secretly?</span> The <span class="ital">present</span> denotes the action as already begun (by the order given).

It is highly probable that the conversation of the Roman officers would be in Latin, and that the proceedings of the previous day may have been conducted in that language. In this way, if Paul and Silas were unfamiliar with the Latin speech, we might account for the non-mention or the disregard of their Roman citizenship. If either the Apostle did not comprehend all that was going on or could not, amid the confusion of such a tumultuous court, make himself understood, the message which he now sends to the magistrates might have had no chance of being heard before the scourging was inflicted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They have beaten us openly</span>] i.e. publicly.

The crowd shouted with the accusers, and the magistrates, forgetting their position, joined with the mob (<a href="/acts/16-22.htm" title="And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.">Acts 16:22</a>) in the assault on the Apostles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">being Romans</span>] The Greek is more full=<span class="ital">men that are Romans</span>, (so <span class="ital">R. V.</span>) and is in marked contrast with the charge of the accusers, which ran, “These men, being Jews.” The laws which had been violated by this act were the <span class="ital">Lex Valeria</span> (b.c. 508) and the <span class="ital">Lex Porcia</span> (b.c. 300). On the outrage, compare Cicero’s language in the Verrine orations (v. 66), ‘Facinus est vinciri civem Romanum, <span class="ital">scelus verberari</span>, prope parricidium necari.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thrust us out privily</span>] The Apostle would say: let our dismissal from prison be as widely published as was our previous punishment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ῥωμαίους</span>, <span class="ital">Romans</span>) The citizens of Tarsus had the rights of Roman citizenship. Paul does not use the plea of his being a <span class="ital">Roman</span> as his principal argument, but for another reason, viz. to serve as a consideration which would have weight with his adversaries (<span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἄνθρωπον</span>). In the region which he now for the first time visited, a more specious persecution might have created the opinion that he was one of a wicked life, and this would have raised a prejudice in the way of the spreading of the Gospel. Wherefore Paul makes a solemn protestation once for all, that he is innocent. The innocence of the apostles was known at Jerusalem; for which reason they bore all things there in silence.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ</span>) This expresses a degree of just <span class="greekheb">ἀποτομία</span>, <span class="ital">severity</span>, and sternness. For bitterness had no place in the apostle’s mind, especially at so gracious a season: <a href="/acts/16-26.htm" title="And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.">Acts 16:26</a>; <a href="/acts/16-33.htm" title="And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.">Acts 16:33</a>.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">themselves</span>) not by the <span class="ital">sergeants</span> or attendants.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> <span class="accented">- Publicly</span> for <span class="accented">openly</span> A.V. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <a href="/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>; <a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>); <span class="accented">men that are</span> for <span class="accented">being</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">do they now cast</span> for <span class="accented">now do they thrust</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bring for fetch</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Men that are Romans</span>. We have exactly the same phrase in <a href="/acts/22-25.htm">Acts 22:25</a>, on a similar occasion, where also is the only other example of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, uncondemned.  <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with a like meaning ("untried," "without trial"), is common in classical Greek. The Latin phrase is <span class="accented">indicta causa.</span> By the Lex Valeria (A.U.C. 254), "No quis magistratus civem Romanum adversus provocationem necaret neve verberaret," every Roman citizen had a right to appeal (<span class="accented">provocare</span>) to the populace against any sentence of death or stripes pronounced by the consuls or any other magistrate; and by the Lex Porcia (A.U.C. 506), no Roman citizen could be scourged. Silas, it appears from the phrase, "us...  men that are Romans," was also a <span class="accented">civis Romanus.</span> But nothing more is known about it. It does not appear why their exemption as Roman citizens was not made good before; but probably the magistrates refused to listen to any plea in their haste and violence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans<p>Hackett remarks that "almost every word in this reply contains a distinct allegation. It would be difficult to find or frame a sentence superior to it in point of energetic brevity." Cicero in his oration against Verres relates that there was a Roman citizen scourged at Messina; and that in the midst of the noise of the rods, nothing was heard from him but the words, "I am a Roman citizen." He says: "It is a dreadful deed to bind a Roman citizen; it is a crime to scourge him; it is almost parricide to put him to death." </body></html>
