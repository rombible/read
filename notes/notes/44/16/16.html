It should be stated, however, that the Greek noun is used without the article, and that this is so far in favour of the Received rendering. On the other hand, we find the noun <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>or <span class= "ital">church, </span>used without the article in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm" title="Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.">1Corinthians 14:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-35.htm" title="And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.">1Corinthians 14:35</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-6.htm" title="Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:">3John 1:6</a>, and it is, therefore, probable that <span class= "ital">proseucha</span> might be used in the same way, just as we speak of “going to church, or to chapel,” without the article. This was probably on the following Sabbath, or possibly after a longer interval, when the mission of the Apostles had become known, and had caused some excitement.<p><span class= "bld">A certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination.</span>—Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">a spirit of Python, </span>or, as some MSS. give it, <span class= "ital">a Python spirit. </span>The Python was the serpent worshipped at Delphi, as the symbol of wisdom, from whom the Pythian priestesses took their name, and from whom Apollo, as succeeding to the oracular power of the serpent, took the same adjective. The fact that St. Luke, who in his Gospel describes like phenomena as coming from <span class= "ital">daemonia, </span>“evil spirits,” “unclean spirits,” should here use this exceptional description, seems to imply either that this was the way in which the people of Philippi spoke of the maiden, or else that he recognised in her phenomena identical with those of the priestesses of Delphi, the wild distortions, the shrill cries, the madness of an evil inspiration. After the manner of sibyls, and sorceresses, and clairvoyants of other times, the girl, whom Augustine describes as <span class= "ital">fæmina ventriloqua</span>—the phrase probably-expressing the peculiar tones characteristic of hysteria—was looked on as having power to divine and predict (“soothsaying,” as distinct from “prophesying,” exactly expresses the force of the Greek verb), and her wild cries were caught up and received as oracles. Plutarch (<span class= "ital">de Defect. Orac., </span>p. 737) speaks of the name Python as being applied commonly, in his time, to “ventriloquists” of this type. As she was a slave, her masters traded on her supposed inspiration, and made the girl, whom prayer and quiet might have restored to sanity, give answers to those who sought for oracular guidance in the perplexities of their lives.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">As we went to prayer </span>— Or to the place of prayer, mentioned before; <span class="ital">a certain damsel met us </span>(that is, met Paul and his three companions) <span class="ital">possessed with a spirit of divination </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εχουσαν πνευμα πυθωνος</span>, <span class="ital">having a spirit of Python, </span>or Apollo.

Plutarch tells us, that those who were inspired with this spirit were <span class="greekheb">εγγαστριμυθοι</span>, persons who spake as seeming to send the voice from their bellies; and Galen mentions the same fact. The manner in which Luke relates the story, plainly implies that he thought this to be a real possession, and that Paul himself viewed it in that light. Nor can the girl’s behaviour, or his, or that of her masters afterward, be accounted for, without allowing this to have been the case. It is well known that the Hebrews called the spirit with which such persons were supposed to be agitated, <span class="greekheb">אוב</span>, <span class="ital">ob, </span>because the bodies of those who appeared to be possessed by it were violently distended, like leathern bottles full of wine, and ready to burst.

Whether this was on the same day in which the conversion of Lydia occurred, or at another time, is not mentioned by the historian.<p>A certain damsel - A maid, a young woman.<p>Possessed with a spirit of divination - Greek: Python. See the margin. Python, or Pythios, was one of the names of Apollo, the Grecian god of the fine arts, of music, poetry, medicine, and eloquence. Of these he was esteemed to have been the inventor. He was reputed to be the third son of Jupiter and Latona. He had a celebrated temple and oracle at Delphi, which was resorted to from all parts of the world, and which was perhaps the only oracle that was in universal repute. The name Python is said to have been given him because, as soon as he was born, he destroyed with arrows a serpent of that name, that had been sent by Juno to persecute Latona; hence, his common name was the Pythian Apollo. He had temples on Mount Parnassus, at Delphi, Delos, Claros, Tenedos, etc., and his worship was almost universal. In the celebrated oracle at Delphi, the priestess of Apollo pretended to be inspired; became violently agitated during the periods of pretended inspiration; and during those periods gave such responses to inquirers as were regarded as the oracles of the god. Others, it is probable, would also make pretensions to such inspiration; and the art of fortune-telling, or of jugglery, was extensively practiced, and was the source of much gain. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/8-8.htm">Acts 8:8-10</a>. What was the cause of this extensive delusion in regard to the oracle at Delphi it is not necessary now to inquire.

That is, to the house of prayer, or to the oratory, as they were in the way to it; for this is not to be understood of their just going to the act, or duty of prayer; for the damsel that now met them, is said to follow them, and to do so for many days, one after another; and it was by their going to the prayer house, that she knew what they were; and besides, the phrase of "going to prayer", as used by us, for the act or duty of prayer, is a mere Anglicism, and unknown to the eastern writers: now this their going to the oratory, was after they had been at Lydia's house, and had been entertained and refreshed there; whether this was on the same day that she was converted and baptized, is not certain: however, so it was, that <p>a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination, met us; in the Greek text it is, "the spirit of Python"; the Alexandrian copy and the Vulgate Latin version read, "the spirit Python"; the same with Apollo, who was called Pythius, as was his oracle, from the people coming to him,  to inquire of him and consult with him, about difficult matters (y); or rather from the Hebrew word  which signifies a serpent; and so Apollo is said to have his name Pythius, from his killing the serpent Typhon, or Python (z); hence the city of Delphos, where was the oracle of Apollo, was called Pytho (a); the prophetess that sat upon the golden tripos, and delivered out the oracles, Pythia; and the feasts and plays instituted to the honour of Apollo, were called the Pythian feasts and plays, and the place of the oracle Pythium (b): and so this maid, or the spirit in her, pretended to divine and foretell things to come; and the Arabic renders it, "an unclean spirit, foretelling future things": the Jews (c) make this spirit of Python, to be the same with Ob, which we render a familiar spirit, <a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a> and the Septuagint by "Engastrimythos", a ventriloquist, one that seemed to speak out of his belly, and pretended to predict future events; and most of the versions in the Polyglot Bible render it by "Python", the word here used: so the Jews say (d), that a master of Ob (as the woman of Endor is called the mistress of Ob), , this is "Python": and so Jarchi on <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm">Deuteronomy 18:11</a> explains the word, and adds, that it is one that speaks out of his arm holes, as those sort of people did from several parts of their bodies, and even from their secret parts: the word signifies a bottle, and they were called masters or mistresses of the bottle; either because the place on which they sat, and from whence they gave forth their oracles, was in the form of one; or they made use of a bottle in their divinations; or as Schindler (e) observes, being possessed, they swelled and were inflated like bottles; and being interrogated, they gave forth answers out of their bellies, concerning things past, present, and to come: and this speaking out of their bellies might be done, without the possession of a real spirit, and much less was it from God, as Plutarch (f), an Heathen himself, observes; <p>"it is foolish and childish, to think that God, as the ventriloquists formerly called Eurycleans, and now Pythonists, should hide himself in the bodies of the prophets, using their mouths and voices as instruments to speak with, for this was done by turning their voices down their throats.'' <p>The first of this sort was one Eurycles, of whom Aristophanes (g) makes mention; and the Scholiast upon him says, that he was a ventriloquist, and was said by the Athenians to prophesy by a "demon" that was in him, when it was only an artificial way of speaking; Tertullian affirms he had seen such women that were ventriloquists, from whose secret parts a small voice was heard, as they sat and gave answers to things asked: Caelius Rhodiginus writes, that he often saw a woman a ventriloquist, at Rhodes, and in a city of Italy his own country; from whose secrets, he had often heard a very slender voice of an unclean spirit, but very intelligible, tell strangely of things past or present, but of things to come, for the most part uncertain, and also often vain and lying; and Wierus relates of one Peter Brabantius, who as often as he would, could speak from the lower part of his body, his mouth being open, but his lips not moved, whereby he deceived many by this cunning; and there was a man at court in King James the First's time here in England, who could act this imposture in a very lively manner (h): but now whether the spirit that was in this maid was a cheat, an imposture of this kind, is not so easy to say; it seems by the dispossession that follows, that it was a real spirit that possessed her; though some think it was no other than a deluding, devilish, imposture: <p>which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying: divining or prophesying; it seems she had many masters, who had a propriety in her, and shared the gain she brought; unless by them are meant her master and mistress: vast treasures were brought to the temple at Delphos, by persons that applied to the Pythian oracle there; and great quantities were got by particular persons, who pretended to such a spirit, by which they told fortunes, and what should befall people hereafter, or where their lost or stolen goods were, and such like things; and of such sort were the magical boys and servants Pignorius (i) makes mention of, out of Apuleius, Porphyry, and others, who either for gain or pleasure, performed many strange things. <p>(y) Phurnutus de natura deorum, p. 94.

That Paul and his companions accepted this pressing invitation of Lydia, and chose her house for their abode, Luke leaves the reader to infer from <span class="greekheb">καὶ παρεβιάσατο ἡμᾶς</span>, <a href="/acts/16-15.htm" title="And when she was baptized, and her household, she sought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.">Acts 16:15</a>, and he now passes over to another circumstance which occurred on another walk to the same <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span> mentioned before. What now follows thus belongs to quite another day. Heinrichs and Kuinoel assume that it attached itself directly to the preceding: that the conversion and baptism of Lydia had occurred while the women (<a href="/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a>) were waiting at the <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span> for the commencement of divine worship; and that, when they were about to enter into the <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span>, this affair with the soothsaying damsel occurred. In opposition to this it may be urged, first, that <a href="/acts/16-15.htm" title="And when she was baptized, and her household, she sought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.">Acts 16:15</a> would only interrupt and disturb the narrative (especially by <span class="greekheb">καὶ παρεβιάσατο ἡμᾶς</span>); secondly, that the beginning of <a href="/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16</a> itself (<span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο δέ</span>) indicates the narration of a new event; and thirdly, that the instruction and baptism of Lydia, and still more of her whole house, cannot naturally be limited to so short a period.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to the reading <span class="greekheb">ἔχουσαν πνεῦμα πύθωνα</span> (see the critical remarks), the passage is to be interpreted: <span class="ital">who was possessed by a spirit Python</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">by a demon, which prophesied from her belly</span>. The damsel was a ventriloquist, and as such practised soothsaying. The name of the well-known Delphic dragon, <span class="greekheb">Πύθων</span> (Apollod. i. 4. 1), became subsequently the name of a <span class="greekheb">δαιμόνιον μαντικόν</span> (Suidas, who has the quotation: <span class="greekheb">τάς τε πνεύματι Πύθωνος ἐνθουσιώσας</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἠξίου τὸ ἐσόμενον παραγορεῦσαι</span>, but was also, according to Plut. <span class="ital">de def. orac.</span> 9, p. 414 E, used <span class="ital">appellatively</span>, and that of <span class="ital">soothsayers, who spoke from the belly</span>. So also Suidas: <span class="greekheb">ἐγγαστρίμυθος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγγαστρίμαντις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅν τινες νῦν πύθωνα</span>, <span class="greekheb">Σοφοκλῆς δὲ στερνόμαντιν</span>. This use of <span class="greekheb">πύθων</span>, corresponding to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">אוֹב</span> (which the LXX. render by <span class="greekheb">ἐγγαστρίμυθος</span>, <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm" title="Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm" title="And the soul that turns after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm" title="A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:27</a>; see Schleusner, Thes. II. p. 222), and also passing over to the Rabbins (R. Salomo on <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>; Sanhedr. f. 65. 1 in Wetstein), is to be assumed in our passage, as otherwise we could not see why Luke should have used this peculiar word, whose specific meaning (ventriloquist-soothsayer) was certainly the less strange to him, as the thing itself had so important allusions in the O.T. and LXX. suggesting it to those possessed of Jewish culture (<a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm" title="Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that has a familiar spirit at Endor.">1 Samuel 28:7</a>), just as among the Greeks the jugglery which the ventriloquists (the <span class="greekheb">Εὑρυκλεῖς</span> or <span class="greekheb">Εὑρυκλεῖδαι</span>) practised was well enough known; see Hermann, gottesd. Alterth. § xlii. 16. Without doubt, the damsel was considered by those who had their fortunes told by her as possessed by a divinity; and that she so regarded herself, is to be inferred from the effect of the apostolic word (<a href="/acts/16-18.htm" title="And this did she many days.

Hers was a state of enthusiastic possession by this fixed idea, in which she actually might be capable of a certain clairvoyance, as in the transaction in our passage. Paul, in his Christian view (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>), regards this condition of hers as that of a demoniac; Luke also so designates it, and treats her accordingly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῖς κυρίοις</span>] There were thus several, who in succession or conjointly had her in service for the sake of gain.

If therefore the girl was regarded as inspired by the Pythian Apollo, the expression in T.R. simply expresses the current pagan estimate of her state; this is the more probable as the physicians of the time, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Hippocrates, spoke of the way in which some symptoms of epilepsy were <span class="ital">popularly</span> attributed to Apollo, Neptune, etc.; article “Divination,” B.D.2, i., 490; C. and H., p. 231, smaller edition; Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, p. 54; Plumptre and Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and Page on the derivation of the word.—<span class="greekheb">ἐργασίαν</span>: only in Luke and Paul; A. and R.V. “gain,” although primarily the word denotes work done, so Rendall, “business”; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/13-19.htm" title="And for gaining and getting, and for good success of his hands, asketh ability to do of him, that is most unable to do any thing.">Wis 13:19</a> well illustrates its use here.

For though the Greek noun here is without the article it is clearly to be rendered as in the previous verse. This must have been on another occasion than that on which Lydia was converted.

The name Python (Plut.,' De Defect. <span class="accented">Orac.</span>,' cap. 9) came thence to be applied to a ventriloquist (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>), or to the spirit that was conceived to dwell in ventriloquists and to speak by them, just as in Hebrew the ventriloquist was sometimes called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> (or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> if a woman), the owner of a spirit of divination, or simply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, a diviner (see <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a> (twice) for the first use, and <a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>; for the second). In some passages, as 1 Kings 28:6 and <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>, it is doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> means the ventriloquist or the spirit. The feminine plural <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3, 9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>) seems always to denote the women, who, like the damsel in the text, practiced the art of ventriloquistic necromancy, whether really possessed by a spirit or feigning to be so. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is only found here in the New Testament. The LXX. usually render <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Gain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), literally, <span class="accented">work, craft</span>, or <span class="accented">trade</span>; then, by metonymy, <span class="accented">the gain</span> proceeding from such trade (<a href="/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By soothsaying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>). So one name of these ventriloquists was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Damsel<p>See on <a href="/acts/12-13.htm">Acts 12:13</a>.<p>Spirit of divination (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3a0;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., a spirit, a Python. Python, in the Greek mythology, was the serpent which guarded Delphi. According to the legend, as related in the Homeric hymn, Apollo descended from Olympus in order to select a site for his shrine and oracle. Having fixed upon a spot on the southern side of Mount Parnassus, he found it guarded by a vast and terrific serpent, which he slew with an arrow, and suffered its body to rot (&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;) in the sun. Hence the name of the serpent Python (rotting); Pytho, the name of the place, and the epithet Pythian, applied to Apollo. The name Python was subsequently used to denote a prophetic demon, and was also used of soothsayers who practised ventriloquism, or speaking from the belly. The word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ventriloquist, occurs in the Septuagint, and is rendered having a familiar spirit (see <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>, 27; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>, 8). The heathen inhabitants of Philippi regarded the woman as inspired by Apollo; and Luke, in recording this ease, which came under his own observation, uses the term which would naturally suggest itself to a Greek physician, a Python-spirit, presenting phenomena identical with the convulsive movements and wild cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi.<p>Soothsaying (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;)<p>Akin to &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to rave, in allusion to the temporary madness which possessed the priestess or sibyl while under the influence of the god. Compare Virgil's description of the Cumaean Sibyl:<p>"And as the word she spake<p>Within the door, all suddenly her visage and her hue<p>Were changed, and all her sleeked hair and gasping breath she drew,<p>And with the rage her wild heart swelled, and greater was she grown,<p>Nor mortal-voiced; for breath of god upon her heart was blown<p>As he drew nigher."<p>Aeneid, vi., 45 sq. </body></html>
