This is the only passage in which the word translated “restitution” is found in the New Testament; nor is it found in the LXX. version of the Old. Etymologically, it conveys the thought of restoration to an earlier and better state, rather than that of simple consummation or completion, which the immediate context seems, in some measure, to suggest. It finds an interesting parallel in the “new heavens and new earth”—involving, as they do, a restoration of all things to their true order—of <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>. It does not necessarily involve, as some have thought, the final salvation of all men, but it does express the idea of a state in which “righteousness,” and not “sin,” shall have dominion over a redeemed and new created world; and that idea suggests a wider hope as to the possibilities of growth in wisdom and holiness, or even of repentance and conversion, in the unseen world than that with which Christendom has too often been content. The corresponding verb is found in the words, “Elias truly shall come first, and <span class= "ital">restore</span> all things” (see Note on <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>); and St. Peter’s words may well be looked on as an echo of that teaching, and so as an undesigned coincidence testifying to the truth of St. Matthew’s record.<p><span class= "bld">Which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets.</span>—The relative, if we take the meaning given above, must be referred to the “times,” not to “things.” The words, compared with <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>, are, as it were, the utterance of a profound dogmatic truth.

Blessed are those who have felt this. It was not needful for the Holy Spirit to make known the times and seasons of these dispensations. These subjects are still left obscure. But when sinners are convinced of their sins, they will cry to the Lord for pardon; and to the penitent, converted, and believing, times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord. In a state of trial and probation, the glorified Redeemer will be out of sight, because we must live by faith in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom the heavens must receive - The common belief of the Jews was, that the Messiah would reign on the earth forever, <a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>. On this account they would object that Jesus could not be the Messiah, and hence, it became so important for the apostles to establish the fact that he had ascended to heaven. The evidence which they adduced was the fact that they saw him ascend, <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>. The meaning of the expression "whom the heavens must receive," is that it was "fit" or "proper" &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;  dei that he should ascend. One reason of that fitness or propriety he himself stated in <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>; compare <a href="/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>. It was also fit or expedient that he should do it, to direct the affairs of the universe for the welfare of the church <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>, and that he should exercise there his office as a priest in interceding for his people, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1-2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>, etc. It is remarkable that Peter did not adduce any passage of Scripture on this subject; but it was one of the points on which there was no clear revelation. Obscure intimations of it might be found in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1-7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a>; etc., but the fact that he would ascend to heaven was not made prominent in the Old Testament. 'The words "whom the heaven must receive" also convey the idea of "exaltation" and "power"; and Peter doubtless intended to say that he was clothed with power, and exalted to honor in the presence of God. See <a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>, "Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right banal of God; angels, and authorities, and powers being made subject unto him." See the notes on <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>.<p>Until - This word implies that he would then return to the earth, but it does not imply that he would not again ascend to heaven.<p>The times of the restitution of all things - The noun rendered restitution &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  apokatastaseo&#772;s, does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The verb from which it is derived occurs eight times. It means properly "to restore a thing to its former situation," as restoring a "strained" or "dislocated" limb to its former soundness. Hence, it is used to restore, or to heal, in the New Testament: <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-13.htm">Matthew 12:13</a>, "And it (the hand) was restored whole as the other"; <a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>; <a href="/luke/6-10.htm">Luke 6:10</a>. And hence, it is applied to the preparation or fitness for the coming of the Messiah which was to attend the preaching of John in the character of Elias, <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm">Matthew 17:11</a>; <a href="/mark/9-12.htm">Mark 9:12</a>. Thus, in Josephus (Antiq., <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3</a>, <a href="/mark/2-8.htm">Mark 2:8</a>), the word is used to denote the return of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon, and their restoration to their former state and privileges. The word has also the idea of "consummation, completion, or filling up." Thus, it is used in Philo, Hesychius, Phavorinus, and by the Greek Classics. (See Lightfoot and Kuinoel.) Thus, it is used here by the Syriac: "Until the complement or filling up of the times"; that is, of all the events foretold by the prophets, etc. Thus, the Arabic: "Until the times which shall establish the perfection or completion of all the predictions of the prophets," etc. In this sense the passage means that the heavens must receive the Lord Jesus until all thrums spoken by the prophets in relation to his work, his reign, the spread of the gospel, the triumph of religion, etc., shall have been fulfilled. It also conveys the idea of the predicted recovery of the world from sin, and the restoration of peace and order; the con. summation of the work of the Messiah, now begun, but not yet complete; slow it may be in its advances, but triumphant and certain in its progress and its close.<p>All things - All things which have been foretold by the prophets. The expression is limited by the connection to this; and of course it does not mean that all people will be saved, or that all the evils of sin can be repaired or remedied. This can never be, for the mischief is done and cannot be undone; but everything which the prophets have foretold shall receive their completion and fulfillment.<p>Which God hath spoken - Which have been revealed, and are recorded in the Old Testament.<p>Of all his holy prophets - This does not mean that each one of the prophets had spoken of these things, but that all which had been spoken would be fulfilled.<p>Since the world began - This is an expression denoting the same as from the beginning, meaning to affirm with emphasis that all the prophecies would be fulfilled. The apostles were desirous to show that they, as well as the Jews, held entirely to the prophets, and taught no doctrine which they had not taught before them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. until the times&#8212;embracing the whole period between the ascension and the second advent of Christ.<p>restitution of all things&#8212;comprehending, probably, the rectification of all the disorders of the fall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whom the heaven must receive; </span> that is, contain after it hath received him, as a real place doth a true body; for such Christ’s body was, which was received into heaven: and heaven is the palace and throne of this King of kings and Lord of lords, where he shall reign until he hath put all his enemies under his feet, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Until the times of restitution of all things; </span> or restoration of all things, when all things shall be restored to that condition from which sin put them: for the fall hath maimed and disordered the whole universe; and probably there is not that excellency in any of the creatures which there was at first, before man (for whom they were made) by his sin brought death to himself, and as it were a dead colour over all them; this makes the whole creation groan and travail in pain until now, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a></span>.

To imagine the latter reference, especially after <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>, is just as arbitrary, as the supplying of that verbal notion is exceedingly harsh. Hofm. <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 648, follows the correct reference of <span class="greekheb">ὡν</span> to <span class="greekheb">χρόνων</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">μὲν</span>: no answering <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> expressed, but the antithesis is found in the <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι χρόνων ἀποκ</span>., “quasi dicat: ubi illud tempus venerit, ex coelo in terras redibit,” Grotius (so Weiss, Blass).—<span class="greekheb">ὅν δεῖ οὐρανὸν δέξασθαι</span>: the words have been rendered in three ways: (1) “whom the heaven must receive,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, as the place assigned to Him by God until the Parousia, <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>. In this case <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> is not used for <span class="greekheb">ἔδει</span>, as if St. Luke were referring to the past historical fact of the Ascension only, but Christ’s exaltation to heaven is represented as a fact continually present until His coming again; or (2) the words have been taken as if <span class="greekheb">ὅν</span> were the subject, “who must possess the heaven”. But the former seems the more natural rendering, so in A.V. and R.V., as more in accordance with the use of <span class="greekheb">δέχεσθαι</span>, and <span class="greekheb">κατέχειν</span> would be rather the word in the second rendering (see Wendt’s note). Zöckler takes the words to mean “who must receive heaven,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, from the Father. Here St. Peter corrects the popular view that the Messiah should remain on earth, <a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>, and if we compare the words with the question asked in <a href="/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>, they show how his views had changed of his Master’s kingdom (see Hackett’s note).—<span class="greekheb">ἄχρι χρόνων ἀποκαταστάσεως</span>: the latter noun is not found either in LXX or elsewhere in N.T., but it is used by Polybius, Diodorus, Plutarch. In Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xi., 3, 8, 9, it is used of the restoration of the Jews to their own land from the captivity, and also in Philo., <span class="ital">Decal.</span>, 30, of the restoration of inheritances at the Jubilee. The key to its meaning here is found not in the question of the disciples in <a href="/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>, but in our Lord’s own saying, <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>, <a href="/mark/9-12.htm" title="And he answered and told them, Elias truly comes first, and restores all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nothing.">Mark 9:12</a>, “Elias truly first cometh, and shall restore all things,” <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀποκαταστήσει πάντα</span>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> LXX, <a href="/malachi/4-6.htm" title="And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.">Malachi 4:6</a>, where the same verb is found (<span class="greekheb">ἀποκυταστήσει</span>). It was the teaching of the Scriptures that Elias should be the forerunner of the Messiah, <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>, and <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-14.htm" title="And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.">Matthew 11:14</a>. But his activity embraced both an external and an internal, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, a moral restoration, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/48-10.htm" title="Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify the wrath of the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury, and to turn the heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.">Sir 48:10</a>. He is said <span class="greekheb">καταστῆσαι φυλὰς Ἰακώβ</span>, to enable those who had been illegally excluded from the congregation to attain their inheritance. But he is eager also for the moral and religious renewal of his people. All disputes would be settled by him at his coming, and chiefly and above all he conducts the people to a great repentance, which will not be accomplished before he comes, <a href="/context/luke/1-16.htm" title="And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God....">Luke 1:16-17</a> (<a href="/malachi/4-6.htm" title="And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.">Malachi 4:6</a>, LXX). This is the inward and moral side of the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατάστασις</span>, <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>, <a href="/mark/9-12.htm" title="And he answered and told them, Elias truly comes first, and restores all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nothing.">Mark 9:12</a>. But as in <a href="/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a> our Lord had corrected the ideas of the disciples as to an external restoration of the kingdom to Israel, so in the Gospels He had corrected their ideas as to the coming of Elias, and had bidden them see its realisation in the preaching of John the Baptist in turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just. And so the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατάστασις πάντων</span> had already begun, in so far as men’s hearts were restored to obedience to God, the beginning of wisdom, to the purity of family affection, to a love of righteousness and a hatred of iniquity. Even when the thoughts of the N.T. writers embrace the renewal of the visible creation, the moral and spiritual elements of restoration were present and prominent; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2 Peter 3:13</a>, <a href="/context/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God....">Romans 8:19-21</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm" title="And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.">Revelation 21:5</a>. So too the <span class="greekheb">παλινγενεσία</span>, in <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>, is joined with the rule which the disciples would share with their Lord, and involved great moral issues. A renewal of all things had no doubt been foretold by the prophets, <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-6.htm" title="Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.">Isaiah 51:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm" title="For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.">Isaiah 65:17</a>; it was dwelt upon in later Jewish writings, and often referred to by the Rabbis (<span class="ital">cf., e.g.,</span> <span class="ital">Book of Enoch</span>, xlv., 2; lxii., 1; xci., 16, 17; <span class="ital">Apocalypse of Baruch</span>, xxxii., and instances in Edersheim, <span class="ital">Jesus the Messiah</span>, ii., p. 343); but even amongst pious Israelites there was always a danger lest their hopes for the future should be mainly associated with material prosperity and national glorification. It is perhaps significant thas Josephus uses the two terms <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατάστασις</span> and <span class="greekheb">παλινγενεσία</span> in close conjunction of the restoration of the Jews to their own land after the exile. How this restoration of all things was to be effected, and what was involved in it, St. Peter does not say, but his whole trend of thought shows that it was made dependent upon man’s repentance, upon his heart being right with God, see Weber, <span class="ital">Jüdische Theologie</span> p. 352 ff. (1897); Edersheim, <span class="ital">Jesus the Messiah</span>, ii., pp. 343, 706; Hauck’s <span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie</span>, “Apokatastasis,” p. 616 ff. (1896).—<span class="greekheb">ὧν</span> refers to <span class="greekheb">χρόνων</span>, so R.V. “whereof,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, of which times. Holtzmann and Wendt on the other hand refer <span class="greekheb">ὧν</span> to <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>. But the words of our Lord in <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a> certainly point to the former reference, and the words are so taken by Weiss, Page, Hackett. In the article from Hauck quoted above, the writer speaks of the reference to <span class="greekheb">χρόνων</span> as the more correct, and points out that if <span class="greekheb">ὧν</span> is the relative to <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>, the restoration spoken of would no longer be a restoration of all things, but only of those things of which the prophets had spoken. On the prophecies referred to see above. All the words from <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span> to <span class="greekheb">προφητῶν</span> are ascribed by Hilgenfeld to his “author to Theophilus”; the thought of the prophets existing <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ αἰῶνος</span> (<a href="/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:">Luke 1:70</a>) belongs in his opinion to the Paulinism of this reviser, just as in Luke’s Gospel he carries back the genealogy of Jesus not to Abraham but to Adam. To a similar Pauline tendency on the part of the same reviser, Hilgenfeld refers the introduction in <a href="/context/acts/3-25.htm" title="You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed....">Acts 3:25-26</a> of the promise made to Abraham embracing all the nations of the earth (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>), and also the introduction of the word <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>), to show that not only upon the Jews, but also upon the Gentiles had God conferred the blessings of the Christ; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>, where the same revising hand is at work. But St. Peter’s “universalism” here is in no way inconsistent with that of a pious Jew who would believe that all nations should be blessed <span class="ital">through Israel</span>, so far, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, as they conformed to the covenant and the law of Israel.

As Christ’s death was for all men’s redemption, the restoration of all things may be said to have begun then.

It is the same as <span class="greekheb">λαβεῖν βασιλείαν</span>, <span class="ital">to receive a kingdom</span>, <a href="/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12</a>, and <span class="greekheb">βασιλεύειν</span>, <span class="ital">to reign</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>. Nor is the force of the verb <span class="greekheb">δέχομαι</span> opposed to this view, as if the heaven ought to be the thing containing, wherein Christ should be contained. Basilius of Seleucia, Or. 11, writes, <span class="greekheb">δέχεται ἡλίας καταγώγιον ἁμαρτίας ἐλεύθερον</span>: and not dissimilar is that in Or. 14, <span class="greekheb">πῶς ὁ οὐρανὸς σαγηνεύεται</span>. Let those instances be added, which E. Schmidius has brought forward on this passage: <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἦλθες ἐν δέοντι</span>, <span class="greekheb">δέξασθαι δόμους</span>, <span class="ital">thou hast not come seasonably, to take</span> (<span class="ital">occupy</span>) <span class="ital">this house</span>; and Demosthenes, <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ διδόντων ὑμῖν τῶν καιρῶν Ἀμφίπολιν δέξασθαι δύναισθʼ ἄν</span>, <span class="ital">not even if the opportunity itself should give you Amphipolis, would you be able to lay hold of it</span>. Furthermore, the verb <span class="greekheb">δέξασθαι</span> has this emphasis, that it denotes a thing offered to us. For the Father said to the Son, <span class="ital">Take possession of heaven, Sit at My right hand, Sit on My throne which is heaven</span>. In fine, <span class="greekheb">δέξασθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to receive</span> or <span class="ital">take to Himself</span>, has an inceptive notion, and yet it is said in the present <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">it behoves</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ἔδει</span>, <span class="ital">it behoved</span>; although the Ascension had taken place not yesterday or the day before. In fact, Peter speaks concerning a fact which, as compared with His glorious advent from heaven, was still as it were present, especially in relation to His hearers, who were even now approaching to the faith.—<span class="greekheb">ἄχρι χρόνων ἀποκαταστάσεως</span>, <span class="ital">until the times of restitution shall come</span>) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> until they (these times) shall be fulfilled. So <span class="greekheb">ἄχρις ἡμερῶν πέντε</span>, in five days (“ipsos quinque dies”), ch. <a href="/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι χαιροῦ</span>, <span class="ital">for a season</span>, ch. <a href="/acts/13-11.htm" title="And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.">Acts 13:11</a>. Similar phrases occur, <a href="/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-2.htm" title="But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.">Galatians 4:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm" title="But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.">Hebrews 3:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-8.htm" title="And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.">Revelation 15:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-17.htm" title="For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.">Revelation 17:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm" title="And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.">Revelation 20:3</a>. Peter comprises the whole course of the times of the New Testament between the Ascension of the Lord and His Advent in glory, times in which that apostolic age shines forth pre-eminent, <a href="/acts/3-24.htm" title="Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.">Acts 3:24</a>, as also corresponding to it the condition of the Church, which was to be constituted of Jews and Gentiles, together, [32] Justus Jonas says, “Christ is that King, who has now received heaven, reigning in the meantime through the Gospel in the Spirit, until all things be restored, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> until the remainder of the Jews and the Gentiles be converted.” Romans 11. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκατάστασις</span> is the <span class="ital">restitution</span> of things from their confusion into their former order. You will say, Were then all things at any time in such a state as that to which they are to be restored? Answer: 1) They were, at least as far as concerns their beginnings: comp. <a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>, “Elias truly shall first come and <span class="ital">restore</span> all things:” for which reason the apostles also above used this verb, ch. <a href="/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>, “Wilt Thou at this time <span class="ital">restore again</span> the kingdom to Israel?” 2) There is a reference to the Divine intention and promise: as a man born blind is said <span class="ital">to recover his sight</span>, because the sight is a natural blessing. Weigh well the word <span class="greekheb">השיב ἀποκαθίστημι</span>, <a href="/jeremiah/16-15.htm" title="But, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.">Jeremiah 16:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-6.htm" title="For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.">Jeremiah 24:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-19.htm" title="And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on mount Ephraim and Gilead.">Jeremiah 50:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-55.htm" title="When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.">Ezekiel 16:55</a>. The restoration of all things shall be accomplished, when all enemies shall be the footstool of Christ: <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>; a consummation which is being gradually accomplished now, and shall be quickly brought about at some future time.—<span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>, <span class="ital">of all things</span>) <span class="ital">The universal whole</span> is opposed to <span class="ital">heaven</span>, as to a part of that whole.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὯΝ</span></span></span>) for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἃ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">which</span>,—<span class="greekheb">ἐλάλησεν</span>, <span class="ital">spake</span>) <span class="greekheb">נאם</span>, <span class="ital">spake</span> [made a solemn declaration, <a href="/jeremiah/23-31.htm" title="Behold, I am against the prophets, said the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He said.">Jeremiah 23:31</a>].—[<span class="greekheb">τῶν ἁγίων</span>, <span class="ital">the holy</span>) All the prophets were holy: they all entered heaven, <a href="/luke/13-28.htm" title="There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.">Luke 13:28</a>.

If so, the time of restoration is not exactly synchronous with the times of refreshing, but preparatory to them; preparatory, too, to that restoration of the kingdom to Israel of which the apostles spake to the Lord (<a href="/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). Probably, however, St. Peter includes in his view the immediately following times of" the presence of the Lord," just as in St. Mark (<a href="/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>) the preparatory mission of John the Baptist is included in the phrase, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof God spake</span>.
