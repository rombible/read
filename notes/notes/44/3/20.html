Blessed are those who have felt this. It was not needful for the Holy Spirit to make known the times and seasons of these dispensations. These subjects are still left obscure. But when sinners are convinced of their sins, they will cry to the Lord for pardon; and to the penitent, converted, and believing, times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord. In a state of trial and probation, the glorified Redeemer will be out of sight, because we must live by faith in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall send ... - <a href="/acts/1-1.htm">Acts 1:1</a> l. Under this economy of things, he shall send Jesus Christ, that is, the Messiah, to teach people; to redeem them; to save them; to judge the world; to gather his people to himself; and to condemn the wicked. Under this economy they were then. This, therefore, was an argument why they should repent and turn to God, that they might escape in the day of judgment.<p>Which before was preached ... - Who has been proclaimed as the Messiah. The name "Jesus Christ" is equivalent here to "the Messiah." The Messiah had been proclaimed to the Jews as about to come. In his time was to be the period of refreshing. He had come; and they were under the economy in which the blessings of the Messiah were to be enjoyed. This does not refer to his personal ministry, or to the preaching of the apostles, but to the fact that the Messiah had been a long time announced to them by the prophets as about to come. All the prophets had preached him as the hope of the nation. It may be remarked, however, that there is here a difference in the manuscripts. A large majority of them read &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  prokecheirismenon, who was designated or appointed, instead of who was preached. This reading is approved by Griesbach, Knapp, Bengel, etc. It was followed in the ancient Syriac, the Arabic, etc., and is undoubtedly the true reading. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. he shall send Jesus Christ&#8212;The true reading is, "He shall send your predestinated (or foreordained) Messiah, Jesus."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To remove all evils and miseries from his people; when that Sun shines all clouds and mists are scattered.

Or "that he may send Jesus Christ", as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it: not in person, for this regards neither his first, nor his second coming, both which might be terrible to the awakened Jews; the former, because he had been sent, and was come, and was gone again; and therefore might fear there was no hope for them, who had denied him, and crucified him; the latter, because they might conclude he would be sent, and come to take vengeance on them, when they should look upon him whom they had pierced with horror and trembling; but here it regards his being sent, and his coming in the ministration of the word, and by his Spirit, to the comfort of their souls: <p>which before was preached unto you; in the writings of the Old Testament, in the books of Moses, and of the Prophets, <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a> or, as it is read in the Alexandrian copy, and in other copies, and in the Complutensian edition, and in the Syriac and Arabic versions, who was "predetermined" or "prepared for you"; that is, in the purposes, council, and covenant of God.
