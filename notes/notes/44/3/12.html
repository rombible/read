Why do you wonder at what has now happened, when so much greater miracles have lately been performed among you? The fact was indeed marvellous, and they justly wondered at it, but it was no more than what Christ had done many a time. It was but a little before that Christ had raised Lazarus from the dead: nay, and he had lately risen from the dead himself; why did they not marvel at these facts, and why were they not convinced by them? Observe, reader, stupid and thoughtless people think that strange now which might have been very familiar to them, if they had not been wanting to themselves, and void of consideration. <span class="ital">Or why look ye so earnestly on us </span>— With that astonishment which your looks express, as though by <span class="ital">our own power </span>we had effected this cure; or by our own <span class="ital">holiness </span>had deserved that God should perform it by us. <span class="ital">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, </span>&c. — This was wisely introduced here in the beginning of his discourse, that it might appear they taught no new religion, inconsistent with that of Moses, and were far from having the least design to divert their regards from the God of Israel; <span class="ital">hath glorified his son Jesus </span>— Namely, by this miracle, as he also glorified him in his life and in his death, and especially in his resurrection and ascension; <span class="ital">whom </span>— When God had given him to you, and when you ought to have received him as a most precious treasure, and to have preserved him with all your power; <span class="ital">ye delivered up </span>— To the Romans as a criminal, and <span class="ital">denied </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ηρνησασθε</span>, <span class="ital">renounced him; in the presence of Pilate </span>— Or, <span class="ital">against the face of Pilate, </span>as Dr. Hammond renders it; that is, in defiance of his reasonings with you; <span class="ital">when he was determined to let him go </span>— To release him, being fully satisfied he was innocent of the things laid to his charge. <span class="ital">But ye denied the Holy One </span>— Whom God had marked out as such; and the <span class="ital">Just </span>One — Just even in the judgment of Pilate, declaring that you would not own him as your king, nor even be contented to admit his discharge, when it was offered and pressed upon you by the governor: <span class="ital">and desired </span>— With outrageous clamour, one of the most infamous of mankind, a robber, and <span class="ital">a murderer, to be granted unto you </span>— To be spared and released. And while you asked for the deliverance of so vile a wretch, you inhumanly and insolently <span class="ital">killed the Prince of life </span>— Even him who had life in himself, and was appointed to be the Author of life, spiritual and eternal, and glory, to his followers. Observe the antithesis: You desired a destroyer of life to be released, and Christ the Lord and giver of life to be crucified, as if a murderer had deserved better at your hands than the Saviour! than which a greater affront could not have been put upon him. You did at once a wicked and foolish thing, in taking away <span class="ital">his life, </span>who would have been your life and Saviour, thus forsaking and rebelling against your own mercies; and in supposing you could conquer and extinguish in death the Prince of life, who, having life in himself, could soon resume the life he had resigned! <span class="ital">Whom God raised </span>— As we know by the certain and repeated testimony of our own senses; and thereby amply vindicated him; <span class="ital">whereof we are witnesses </span>— Constituted such by God, in order to the conviction and salvation of others. <span class="ital">And his name </span>— He himself, his power and love; <span class="ital">through faith in his name </span>— A confidence in him, a dependance on him, a believing application to him, and expectation of power to proceed from him; <span class="ital">hath made this man strong </span>— Hath effected a perfect cure of his lameness. Dr. Lightfoot suggests, that faith is twice named in this verse, because of the apostles’ faith in working this miracle, and the cripple’s faith in receiving it. But it seems to relate chiefly, if not only, to the former: they that wrought this miracle by faith, derived power from Christ to work it, and, therefore, returned all the glory to him. By this true and just account of the miracle, Peter both confirmed the great gospel truth they were to preach to the world, that Jesus Christ is the fountain of all power and grace, and the great Healer and Saviour; and recommended the great gospel mystery of our salvation by Christ. It is his name that justifies us, that glorious name of his, the Lord our righteousness; but we, in particular, are justified by that name, through faith in it, applying it to ourselves. Thus doth Peter preach unto them Jesus and him crucified, being a faithful friend of the bridegroom, to whose service he devoted all his interest.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-18 Observe the difference in the manner of working the miracles. Our Lord always spoke as having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive the greatest honour that was given to him on account of his Divine miracles. But the apostles referred all to their Lord, and refused to receive any honour, except as his undeserving instruments. This shows that Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while the apostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for every thing on Jesus, whose power effected the cure. Useful men must be very humble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory. Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed the Jews the greatness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them to despair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do it through ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When Peter saw it - Saw the people assembling in such multitudes and wondering at the miracle.<p>He answered - The word "answer," with us, implies that a question had been asked, or that some subject had been proposed for consideration. But the word is used in a different sense in the Bible. It is often used when no question was asked, but when an occasion was offered for remarks, or when an opportunity was presented to make a statement. It is the same as replying to a thing, or making a statement in regard to some subject, <a href="/daniel/2-26.htm">Daniel 2:26</a>; <a href="/acts/5-8.htm">Acts 5:8</a>.<p>Ye men of Israel - Jews. Compare <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>.<p>Why marvel ye at this? - The particular thing which he intended to reprove here was not that they wondered, for that was proper; but that they looked on himself and John as if they had been the authors of this healing. They ought to have understood it. The Jews were sufficiently acquainted with miracles to interpret them and to know whence they proceeded; and they ought not, therefore, to ascribe them to man, but to inquire why they had been performed by God.<p>Why look ye ... - Why do ye fix the eyes with amazement on us, as though we could do this? Why not look at once to God?<p>By our own power - By any art of healing or by any medicine we had done this.<p>Or holiness - Piety. As if God had bestowed this on us on account of our personal and eminent piety. It may be remarked that here was ample opportunity for them to establish a reputation of their own. The people were disposed to pay them honor; they might at once have laid claim to vast authority over them; but they refused all such personal honor, and ascribed all to the Lord Jesus. Whatever success may attend the ministers of the gospel, or however much the world may be disposed to do them honor, they should disclaim all power in themselves, and ascribe it to the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not by the talents or personal holiness of ministers, valuable as these are, that people are saved; it is only by the power of God, designed to honor his Son.

That this <span class="ital">telic</span> designation of <span class="ital">that which</span> was done is given with the <span class="ital">genitive of the infinitive</span>, is certainly to be traced to the frequent use of this form of expression in the LXX. (see Winer, p. 306 [E. T. 410]); but the conception of the aim is not on that account to be obliterated as the defining element of the expression, especially as even in classical writers this mode of conception is found, and presents itself in the expression <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν ὅπως</span>.

This address of St. Peter divides itself into two parts, 12–16, 17–26, and although it covers much of the same ground as in chap. 2, there is no need to regard it with Overbeck and Holtzmann as unhistorical: see Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and Feine; the latter points out that St. Peter would naturally, as in chap. 3, take the incident before him as his text, place it in its right light, and draw from it an appeal to repentance and conversion. But whilst we may grant the common and identical aim of the two discourses, to proclaim the Messiahship of Jesus before the Jews, none can fail to see that in chap. 3 the Messianic idea becomes richer and fuller. Jesus is the prophet greater than Moses: Jesus is the fulfilment of the Abrahamic covenant, through which the blessing of Abraham is to extend to all the earth, <a href="/matthew/8-11.htm" title="And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 8:11</a>. And more than this: St. Peter has learnt to see in the despised Nazarene not only the suffering servant of Jehovah (<span class="greekheb">παῖς</span>), but in the servant the King, and in the seed of David the Prince of Life. And in the light of that revelation the future opens out more clearly before him, and he becomes the first prophet in the Messianic age—the spiritual presence which the believers now enjoyed, and by which those mighty deeds are wrought, is only a foretaste of a more visible and glorious Presence, when the Messiah should return in His glory; and for that return repentance and remission of sins must prepare the way (see Briggs, <span class="ital">Messiah of the Apostles</span>, pp. 31, 32). On St. Peter’s discourses see additional note at end of chapter.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπεκρίνατο</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/13-14.htm" title="And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said to the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.">Luke 13:14</a>; <a href="/luke/14-3.htm" title="And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?">Luke 14:3</a>, answered, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to their looks of astonishment and inquiry.

In the N.T. the word is used, in addition to its use here, by St. Paul ten times in the Pastoral Epistles, and it is found no less than four times in 2 Peter, but nowhere else.

An honorable and conciliatory form of address. The term Israelite gradually gave place to that of Jew; but Israel was the sacred name for the Jews, as the nation of the theocracy, the people under God's covenant, and hence was for the Jew his especial badge and title of honor. "To be descendants of Abraham, this honor they must share with the Ishmaelites; of Abraham and Isaac, with the Edomites; but none except themselves were the seed of Jacob, such as in this name of Israelite they were declared to be. Nor was this all, but more gloriously still, their descent was herein traced up to him, not as he was Jacob, but as he was Israel, who, as a prince, had power with God and with men, and had prevailed" (Trench, "Synonyms"). So Paul, in enumerating to the Philippians his claims to have confidence in the flesh, says he was "of the stock of Israel." It is said that the modern Jews in the East still delight in this title.<p>Our own (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)<p>See on <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>. </body></html>
