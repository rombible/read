It consisted, in the Herodian Temple, of a double row of Corinthian columns, about thirty-seven feet high, and received its name as having been in part constructed, when the Temple was rebuilt by Zerubbabel, with the fragments of the older edifice. The people tried to persuade Herod Agrippa the First to pull it down and rebuild it, but he shrank from the risk and cost of such an undertaking (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 9, § 7). It was, like the porticos in all Greek cities, a favourite place of resort, especially as facing the morning sun in winter. (See Note on <a href="/john/10-23.htm" title="And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.">John 10:23</a>.) The memory of what had then been the result of their Master’s teaching must have been fresh in the minds of the two disciples. Then the people had complained of being kept in suspense as to whether Jesus claimed to be the Christ, and, when He spoke of being One with the Father, had taken up stones to stone Him (<a href="/context/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31-33</a>).

Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole!

It derived its name from Solomon, and was the only remnant of his temple. A comparison of the notices in Josephus, <span class="ital">B. J.</span>, v., 5, 1; <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xv., 11, 5 and xx., 9, 7, make it doubtful whether the foundations only, or the whole colonnade, should be referred back to Solomon. Ewald’s idea that the colonnade was so called because it was a place of concourse for the wise in their teaching has not found any support: Stanley’s <span class="ital">Jewish Church</span>, ii., 184; Edersheim, <span class="ital">Temple and its Services</span>, pp. 20, 22, and Keim, <span class="ital">Geschichte Jesu</span>, iii., 161. It was situated on the eastern side of the Temple, and so was sometimes called the Eastern Cloister, and from its position it was a favourite resort.—<span class="greekheb">τῇ καλ</span>.: the present participle is used just as the present tense is found in the notice in St. John’s Gospel, chap. <a href="/acts/5-2.htm" title="And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.">Acts 5:2</a> (see Blass, <span class="ital">Philology of the Gospels</span>, pp. 241, 242), and if we cannot conclude from this that the book was composed before the destruction of the Temple, the vividness of the whole scene and the way in which Solomon’s Porch is spoken of as still standing, points to the testimony of an eye-witness. Nösgen argues that this narrative and others in the early chapters may have been derived directly from St. John, and he instances some verbal coincidences between them and the writings of St. John (<span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 28). But if we cannot adopt his conclusions there are good reasons for referring some of these Jerusalem incidents to St. Peter, or to John Mark, see introduction and chap. 12.

There is no account of any such porch in Solomon’s own Temple, but Josephus tells us (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. xx. 9. 7) that there was an eastern porch in Herod’s Temple called by this name. The mention of this feature in the building is a sign that the writer, from whom St Luke drew, was one acquainted with the localities about which he speaks, and that the account was written before the fall of Jerusalem, or he would not have said <span class="ital">is called</span>, or if he had done so would have been convicted of inconsistency of language by those to whom his work was first presented.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/3-11.htm" title="And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.">Acts 3:11</a>.
