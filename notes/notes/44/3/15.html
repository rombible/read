The “Prince of life,” the “Captain of salvation,” is accordingly He who is the source from which life and salvation flow.

Our Lord always spoke as having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive the greatest honour that was given to him on account of his Divine miracles. But the apostles referred all to their Lord, and refused to receive any honour, except as his undeserving instruments. This shows that Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while the apostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for every thing on Jesus, whose power effected the cure. Useful men must be very humble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory. Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed the Jews the greatness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them to despair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do it through ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And killed the Prince of life - The word rendered "prince" denotes properly "a military leader or commander." Hence, in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>, it is translated "captain:" "It became him ...to make the "Captain of their salvation" perfect through sufferings." As a captain or commander leads on to victory and is said to obtain it, so the word comes to denote one who is the "cause," the "author," the "procurer," etc. In this sense it is used, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>, "Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel," etc. In <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a> it is properly rendered author, "Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith." The word "author," or "giver," would express the meaning of the word here. It also implies that he has dominion over life; an idea, indeed, which is essentially connected with that of his being the author of it. The word "life" here is used in a large sense, as denoting "all manner of life." In this sense it is used in reference to Christ in <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>, "In him was life."

The use of the word in the LXX may help to justify such a distinction, for whilst it is found in the sense of a leader or a captain (<a href="/numbers/14-4.htm" title="And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.">Numbers 14:4</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/14-2.htm" title="And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shall come forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and go forth every valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over them, as though ye would go down into the field toward the watch of the Assyrians; but go not down.">Jdt 14:2</a>), or the chief of a family or tribe (R.V. renders it “every one a prince” in <a href="/numbers/13-2.htm" title="Send you men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall you send a man, every one a ruler among them.">Numbers 13:2</a>, but in the next verse “heads of the children of Israel”), it is also used to signify the author, or beginner, the source, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-61.htm" title="Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that were authors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them.">1Ma 9:61</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-47.htm" title="But with Alexander they were well pleased, because he was the first that entreated of true peace with them, and they were confederate with him always.">1Ma 10:47</a>, <a href="/micah/1-13.htm" title="O you inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.">Micah 1:13</a> (although it was never used for a prince or to describe kingly attributes); but in many respects the rendering “Prince” may be compared with the Latin <span class="ital">princeps</span>, which signifies the first person in order, a chief, a leader, an originator, the founder of a family (in the time of the emperors it was used of the heir to the throne). So in classical Greek the word was used for a leader, a founder, Latin <span class="ital">auctor</span>, for the first cause, author, so God <span class="greekheb">τῶν πάντων</span>, Plat., and also for a prince, a chief, and, especially in later Greek, of the person from whom anything good or bad first proceeds in which others have a share, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγὸς καὶ αἴτιος</span> combined (<span class="ital">antesignanus et auctor</span>), Polyb., i., 66, 10; Hdian., ii., 6, 22, and as Alford points out in <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>, this later usage throws a light upon its meaning in <a href="/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Chrys. on <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας τούτεστι τὸν αἴτιον τῆς σωτηρίας</span>. Christ is the source of life, a life in which others share through Him; in this very place where St. Peter was speaking our Lord had spoken of Himself as the giver of eternal life, <a href="/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a>, although doubtless the expression may include the thought that in Him was life in its fullest and widest sense—physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual. St. Chrysostom comments on the words “Prince of Life,” <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, xi.: “It follows that the life He had was not from another, the Prince or Author of Life must be He who has life from Himself”. Theophylact and Oecumenius see in the words a contrast to the <span class="greekheb">φονέα</span>, in that Christ gives life, while the murderer takes it away—a contrast deepened by the words of St. Peter’s fellow-disciple whom he here associates with himself in his appeal to the people, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a>.

The marginal rendering <span class="accented">of</span> whom is equally literal, and may be defended by reference to <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="/acts/13-31.htm">Acts 13:31</a>; but the rendering <span class="accented">whereof</span> is in accordance with the more frequent phrases (<a href="/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>; <a href="/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>, etc.). The meaning is practically the same. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The Prince of life (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>The Greek brings out by the position of these words what Bengel calls "the magnificent antithesis" between a murderer and the Prince of life. "Ye demanded a murderer, but the Prince of life ye killed." This is the only place where the phrase occurs. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, though sometimes rendered prince, means, primarily, beginning, and thence originator, author. Better here as Rev., in margin, author, and so by Rev. at <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>. </body></html>
