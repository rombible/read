And so “he entered with them into the Temple,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>into the Court of Women, upon which the Beautiful Gate opened. At this hour, the hour of the evening sacrifice, it would be naturally filled with worshippers.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 The apostles and the first believers attended the temple worship at the hours of prayer. Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he, leaping up - This was a natural expression of joy, and it was a striking fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>; "Then shall the lame man leap as an hart." The account here given is one that is perfectly natural. The man would be filled with joy, and would express it in this manner. He had been lame from a child; he had never walked; and there was more in the miracle than merely giving strength. The art of "walking" is one that is acquired by long practice. Children learn slowly. Caspar Hauser, discovered in one of the cities of Germany, who had been confined in prison from a child, was unable to walk in an easy way when released, but stumbled in a very awkward manner (see his Life). When, therefore, this man was able at once to walk, it was clear proof of a miracle.<p>Praising God - This was the natural and appropriate expression of his feelings on this occasion. His heart would be full; and he could have no doubt that this blessing had come from God alone. It is remarkable that he did not even express his gratitude to Peter and John. They had not pretended to restore him in their own name, and he would feel that man could not do it. It is remarkable that he praised God without being taught or entreated to do it. It was instinctive - the natural feeling of the heart. So a sinner. His first feelings, when he is converted, will be to ascribe the praise to God. While he may and will feel regard for the ministry by whose instrumentality he has received the blessing, yet his main expression of gratitude will be to God. And this he will do instinctively. He needs no prompter; he knows that no power of man is equal to the work of converting the soul, and will rejoice, and give all the praise to the God of grace. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. leaping up, stood &#8230; walked &#8230; entered the temple walking, leaping, and praising God&#8212;Every word here is emphatic, expressing the perfection of the cure, as Ac 3:7 its immediateness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm" title="Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.">Isaiah 35:6</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Then shall the lame man leap as an hart; </span> and thus the lame man manifested that he was perfectly cured, though in an instant, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">walking, and leaping, and praising God, </span> to whom alone he attributed that sudden and perfect (and therefore miraculous) cure; nay, he attributes nothing unto the means; the apostle’s words he knew did little or nothing, but God is all in all unto him: and he leaped, to evidence the truth of the miracle that was wrought upon him, and that his soul rejoiced in God his Saviour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he leaping up,.... From off the bed or couch, or ground on which he lay: <p>stood and walked; stood firm and strong upon his feet, and walked about; by which it was abundantly manifest to himself and others, that he had a perfect cure. The Ethiopic version is a very ridiculous one, "and he went with them catching fishes"; as if upon this, before they went into the temple, he and the apostles went a fishing together, which has not the least foundation in the text: <p>and entered with them into the temple; to join with them in divine worship, to acknowledge the goodness of God to him, and to show respect to the instruments he made use of in his cure: <p>and leaping; for joy of the mercy, and that it might appear to all that he was thoroughly cured of his lameness: and thus the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a> "then shall the lame man leap as an hart", was literally fulfilled: <p>and praising God; and not the apostles; for he knew that this was owing to the power of God, and could never have been done by man; though he might not be ungrateful to the instruments. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/3-8.htm" title="And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.">Acts 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξαλλόμενος</span>: not leaping out of his couch (as has sometimes been supposed), of which there is no mention, but leaping up for joy (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm" title="For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.">Isaiah 55:12</a>, <a href="/joel/2-5.htm" title="Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.">Joel 2:5</a>) (on the spelling with one <span class="greekheb">λ</span> see Blass, p. 51); <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm" title="Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.">Isaiah 35:6</a>. This seems more natural than to suppose that he leaped because he was incredulous, or because he did not know how to <span class="ital">walk</span>, or to avoid the suspicion of hypocrisy (Chrys., <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, viii., so too Oecumenius). St. Chrysostom remarks that it was no less than if they saw Christ risen from the dead to hear Peter saying: “In the name,” etc., and if Christ is not raised, how account for it, he asks, that those who fled whilst He was alive, now dared a thousand perils for Him when dead?—<span class="greekheb">ἔστη καὶ περιεπάτει</span>: “he stood and began to walk” R.V., thus marking the difference between the aorist and the imperfect. Such vivid details may have been derived from St. Peter himself, and they are given here with a vividness characteristic of St. Mark’s Gospel, of which St. Peter may reasonably be regarded as the main source. If St. Luke did not derive the narrative directly from St. Peter, he may easily have done so from the same Evangelist, John Mark, see on chap. 12, and Scharfe, <span class="ital">Die petrinische Strömung der N.

This exultant use of the gift was a part of his “praising God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We can hardly fail to see, if we compare the narrative of this miracle with that of the similar one wrought at Lystra by St Paul (14), to which we have already referred, that St Luke has used faithfully the materials with which he was furnished by “eye-witnesses,” and has given the accounts as he received them without any colouring of his own. In this chapter we have a description such as a painter would desire; the scene is brought vividly before us, and all the characters are in lively action. It is just such an account as we find in St Mark’s Gospel of the cure of the demoniac child (<a href="/context/mark/9-14.htm" title="And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them....">Mark 9:14-27</a>), and both are quite in accord with all that we know of St Peter’s mode of speaking, and from St Peter it is most probable that the narrative in this chapter is derived. On the contrary, the story of the cure wrought at Lystra by St Paul is told in the fewest possible words and with no touch of the graphic power of which this description is so full. The difference bespeaks the faithfulness of the writer of the Acts, and shews us that he has left the narratives as they came to his hand, without any attempt to stamp on them an individuality of his own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/3-8.htm" title="And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.">Acts 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ περιεπάτει</span>, <span class="ital">and he walked about</span>) although he had never learned to walk.
