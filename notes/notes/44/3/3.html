<span class="ital">said, Look on us </span>— This the lame man readily did, <span class="ital">expecting to receive something of them </span>— Namely, for the relief of his temporal necessities. Little did he suppose that a much greater blessing was prepared for him. <span class="ital">Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none </span>— How unlike was Peter to his supposed successor! Can the bishop of Rome either say this, or do what Peter now did? This, we may observe, was after the estates were sold, as mentioned <a href="/acts/2-45.htm" title="And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.">Acts 2:45</a>, and plainly shows how far the apostles were from enriching themselves by the treasures which passed through their hands. <span class="ital">But such as I have give I thee </span>— What is in my power, I willingly impart; and thou shalt find it not less valuable than money. <span class="ital">In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth — </span>That is, by the power of him who, in contempt, is called, <span class="ital">Jesus of Nazareth; rise up and walk </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Be immediately and perfectly healed of thy malady. <span class="ital">And he took him by the hand </span>— Thereby encouraging him to do as he had said; <span class="ital">and lifted him up</span> — In the same name in which he had bid him rise. Not that his doing this could contribute any thing to the lame man’s cure: it was but a sign, intimating the supernatural help that he should receive, if he exerted himself, as he was commanded. When God by his word enjoins us to rise, and walk in the ways of his commandments, if we mix faith with that word, and rely on the power of it, he will give us his Spirit, to take us by the hand, as it were, and lift us up. If we set ourselves to do what we can in dependance on the divine aid, God has promised us his grace to enable us to do what of ourselves we cannot; and by faith in that promise we receive a new nature productive of a new practice: for the grace of God thus received and used shall not be in vain; as it was not here: <span class="ital">his feet and ankle-bones received strength </span>— Which would not have been the case if he had not attempted to rise. <span class="ital">And he, leaping up </span>— From the place where he lay; <span class="ital">stood </span>— In an erect posture, which he had never before been able to do; <span class="ital">and walked </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">περιεπατει</span>, <span class="ital">walked about, </span>with strength and steadiness; <span class="ital">and entered with them into the temple </span>— Into the court of Israel, there to offer the first-fruits of his thanksgivings, sometimes <span class="ital">walking, </span>and sometimes <span class="ital">leaping, </span>for joy, and to show that he was perfectly healed; <span class="ital">and praising God </span>— In a rapture of astonishment and thankfulness for so wonderful a mercy bestowed upon him. Thus was the prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm" title="Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.">Isaiah 35:6</a>) remarkably fulfilled, <span class="ital">Then shall the lame man leap as a hart. </span>This man, being now newly cured, was in this excess of joy and thankfulness: all true converts walk and praise God; but young converts, perhaps, leap more, as it were, in his praises.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 The apostles and the first believers attended the temple worship at the hours of prayer. Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who, seeing Peter ... - There is no evidence that he was acquainted with them or knew who they were.
