This gate, on the east side of the temple, was made of that brass, and exceeded the other gates, as in its dimensions, so especially in its workmanship and splendour, though most of them were covered over with silver or gold. It was thirty cubits high, and fifteen broad, and was added by Herod the Great.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 The apostles and the first believers attended the temple worship at the hours of prayer. Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lame from his mother's womb - The mention of this shows that there was no deception in the case. The man had been always lame; he was obliged to be carried; and he was well known to the Jews.<p>Whom they laid daily - That is, his friends laid him there daily. He would therefore be well known to those who were in the habit of entering the temple. Among the ancients there were no hospitals for the sick, and no alms-houses for the poor. The poor were dependent, therefore, on the Charity of those who were in better circumstances. It became an important matter for them to be placed where they would see many people. Hence, it was customary to place them at the gates of rich men <a href="/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a>; and they also sat by the highway to beg where many persons would pass, <a href="/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a>; <a href="/luke/18-35.htm">Luke 18:35</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-8</a>. The entrance to the temple would be a favorable place for begging; for:<p>(1) great multitudes were accustomed to enter there; and,<p>(2) when going up for the purposes of religion, they would be more inclined to give alms than at other times; and especially was this true of the Pharisees, who were particularly desirous of publicity in bestowing charity. It is recorded by Martial (i. 112) that the custom prevailed among the Romans of placing the poor by the gates of the temples; and the custom was also observed a long time in the Christian churches.<p>At the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful - In regard to this gate there have been two opinions, one of which supposes that it was the gate commonly called Nicanor, which led from the court of the Gentiles to the court of the women (see Plan in notes on <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>), and the other that it was the gate at the eastern entrance of the temple, commonly called Susan. It is not easy to determine which is intended; though from the fact that what is here recorded occurred near Solomon's porch (<a href="/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>; compare the Plan of the Temple, <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>), it seems probable that the latter was intended. This gate was large and splendid. It was made of Corinthian brass, a most valuable metal, and made a magnificent appearance (Josephus, Jewish Wars, book 5, chapter 5, section 3).<p>To ask alms - Charity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. a certain man lame from his mother's womb&#8212;and now "above forty years old" (Ac 4:22).<p>was carried&#8212;was wont to be carried.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Lame from his mother’s womb, </span> and not by any casualty, that so the miracle might be the greater, and the power of the God of nature appear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They laid daily; </span> by which it was manifest, that it could not be by any correspondence between the apostles and the lame man upon this occasion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At the gate of the temple; </span> where there must needs be the greater notice taken of him; none going in or out but such as might see him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Called Beautiful, </span> for the excellency of the workmanship: it was at the entering into the second court, or the court of the Jews from that of the Gentiles.

He was born so; his lameness came not through any disease or fall, or any external hurt, but from a defect in nature, in one of his limbs, or more; which made the after miracle the more extraordinary: and he was so lame that he <p>was carried; he could not walk of himself, or go, being led, but they were obliged to carry him: <p>whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple; it had been a common usage, it may be, for years past, to bring him every day, at prayer time, and lay him at the gate of the temple where the people went in; hence he was well known by the people, and to have been of a long time lame, even ever since he was born; so that there could be no imposture in this case: and it was at the gate of the temple he lay, <p>which is called beautiful; which some think was the gate Shushan, which was the eastern gate of the mountain of the house, or the outmost wall, and was so called, because Shushan, the metropolis of Persia, was pourtrayed upon it (q), which made it look very beautiful. The reason commonly given by the Jewish commentators (r) why this was done, is this; when the Jews returned from captivity, the king of Persia commanded that they should make a figure of the palace of Shushan upon one of the gates of the temple, that they might fear the king, and not rebel against him; and accordingly they drew one upon the eastern gate: but some say (s), that the children of the captivity did this (upon their return) that they might remember the wonder of Purim, (their deliverance from Haman,) which was done in Shushan; moreover, it might be so called from the word Shushan, which signifies joy and gladness: but this does not bid so fair to be the gate here meant, since it was lower than all the rest; for as the eastern wall was lower than the rest of the walls, that when the high priest burnt the red heifer on the top of Mount Olivet, he might see the gate of the temple at the time of the sprinkling of the blood; so the gate itself was four cubits lower than the others (t), and therefore could not look so grand and beautiful as the rest. Indeed, concerning this eastern gate of the mountain of the house, it is said (u), that <p>"in the time when the sanctuary stood, when they prayed on the mountain of the house, they went in by the way of the eastern gate.'' <p>And as this was now the hour of prayer, and the people were going to the temple to pray, whose entrance was at the east gate; here it might be thought, in all probability, was laid the lame man: though it seems rather to be the eastern gate of the court of the women, which was made of Corinthian brass, and looked brighter than gold itself; of which Josephus (w) thus speaks: <p>"nine of the gates were covered all over with gold and silver, likewise the side posts and lintels; but there was one, without the temple, of Corinthian brass, which in dignity greatly exceeded the silver and golden ones.'' <p>And since at this gate was the greatest frequency of persons, both men and women entering here; it is most likely, that here lay the lame man a begging: this is thought, by some, to be the higher gate of the house of the Lord; said to be built by Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, <a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> upon which text, a Jewish commentator of great note (x) has this remark, <p>"observe it is said of Jotham, that he built it, because he made a building on it,  "more glorious and great" than it had been:'' <p>and this is also called the new gate of the house of the Lord, <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a> and which both the Targum and Kimchi on the place say is the eastern gate. <p>To ask alms of them that entered into the temple; who going to religious exercises, might be thought to be more disposed to acts of liberality and charity: and besides, these were known to be Jews, of whom only alms were to be asked and taken; for so run their canons (y), <p>"it is forbidden to take alms of Gentiles publicly, except a man cannot live by the alms of Israelites; and if a king, or a prince of the Gentiles, should send money to an Israelite for alms, he must not return it, because of the peace of the kingdom, but must take it of him, and give it to the poor of the Gentiles secretly, that the king may not hear.'' <p>(q) Misn.

Others (Wagenseil, Lund, Bengel, Walch) understand it of the gate <span class="ital">Susan</span>, which was in the neighbourhood of Solomon’s porch, and at which the market for pigeons and other objects for sacrifice was held. But this is at variance with the signification of the word <span class="greekheb">ὡραῖος</span>; for the name <span class="ital">Susan</span> is to be explained from the Persian capital (<span class="greekheb">שׁוּשַׁן</span>, town of lilies), which, according to Middoth, 1 Kal. 3, was depicted on the gate.[143] Others (Kuinoel, <span class="ital">et al.</span>) think that the gate <span class="ital">Chulda, i.e. tempestiva</span>, leading to the court of the Gentiles, is meant. See Lightf. <span class="ital">Hor. ad Joh.</span> p. 946 f. But this derivation of the name (from <span class="greekheb">חלד</span> <span class="ital">tempus</span>) cannot be historically proved, nor could Luke expect his reader to discover the singular appellation porta tempestiva in <span class="greekheb">ὡραίαν</span>, seeing that for this the very natural “porta speciosa” (Vulg.) could not but suggest itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Among the Gentiles also <span class="ital">beggars sat at the gates of their temples</span> (Martial. 1:112)—a usage probably connected with the idea (also found in ancient Israel) of a special divine care for the poor (Hermann, Privatalterth. § 14. 2).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ αἰτεῖν</span>] <span class="ital">eo fine, ut peteret</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[143] Perhaps, however, this picture of Susa on the gate of the temple is only an invention on account of the name, and the latter might be sufficiently explained from the lily-shaped decorations of the columns (מַעֲשֵׂה שׁוּשַׁן, <a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm" title="And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.">1 Kings 5:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/3-2.htm" title="And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;">Acts 3:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">τις</span>, by its position as in <a href="/luke/11-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which you have sucked.">Luke 11:27</a> directs attention to this man, “the man was conspicuous both from the place and from his malady” Chrys., <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, viii.—<span class="greekheb">χωλὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑπάρχων</span>: “a certain man that was lame” R.V., otherwise <span class="greekheb">ὑπάρχων</span> is not noticed, fittingly used here in its classical sense expressing the connection between the man’s present state and his previous state, see on <a href="/acts/2-30.htm" title="Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;">Acts 2:30</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐβαστάζετο</span>: imperf., expressing a customary act, the man was being carried at the hour of worship when the Temple would be filled with worshippers (Chrysostom); or the verb may mean that he was being carried in the sense that the bearers had not yet placed him in the accustomed spot for begging, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear.

Another interpretation refers the term to the gate Shushan, which was not only close to the Porch of Solomon, but also to the market for the sale of doves and other offerings, and so a fitting spot for a beggar to choose (Zöckler). The gate may have been so called because a picture of the Persian capital Susa was placed over it (Hamburger, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, Town of Lilies. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Hebrew Shushan, a lily, the lily being regarded as the type of beauty.

(so too Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. i., p. 180, E.T.). This court was the place of assembly for the services, and a beggar might naturally choose a position near it. The decision as to which of these gates reference is made to is rendered more difficult by the fact that, so far as we know, no gate bore the name “Beautiful”. But the decision apparently lies between these alternatives, although others have been proposed, <span class="ital">cf.</span> John Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Hor.

Perhaps the lame man leant against one of the open doors. <span class="cmt_word">Which is called Beautiful</span>. It is not certain what gate this was. In the 'Dictionary of the Bible' it is described as "the great eastern gate leading from the court of the women to the upper court," following apparently Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5. 5:3. But it is impossible to reconcile Josephus's two accounts - that in the 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. and that in 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 11. In the former he says distinctly that there were ten gates - four on the north, four on the south, and two on the east. In the latter he says there were three gates on the north, three on the south, and one on the east. In the former he says that fifteen steps led up <span class="accented">from</span> the women's enclosure to the great gate, exactly opposite the gate of the temple itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); in the latter he says very distinctly that women were allowed to enter through the great gate on the east. With such discrepancies in the description of the only eye-witness whose evidence has been preserved, it is impossible to speak with certainly. But it seems probable that there were two gates on the east - one the beautiful and costly gate of Corinthian brass, elaborately described by Josephus, through which the women did pass; the other the greater gate, just opposite to and above the beautiful gate (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), leading from the court of the women to the inner court; and that Josephus has confounded one with the other in his descriptions. Anyhow, the beautiful gate was probably on the east. Its correct name is said to be the gate of Nicanor. <span class="cmt_word">The temple</span>. It must be remembered that the whole platform, including the porches, and the courts of the Gentiles and of the women, and the outer court and the court of the priests, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; the actual house was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; that part of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> to which only Israelites were admitted, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Josephus also divides the precincts into the first, second, and third <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The description of this lame man laid at the gate of the temple to ask alms is very similar to that in <a href="/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> of Lazarus laid at the rich man's gate; only that the word for <span class="accented">laid</span> is in St. Luke <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and here is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>That was (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., being.
