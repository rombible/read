Paul relates the history of his early life very particularly; he notices that his conversion was wholly the act of God. Condemned sinners are struck blind by the power of darkness, and it is a lasting blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews. Convinced sinners are struck blind as Paul was, not by darkness, but by light. They are for a time brought to be at a loss within themselves, but it is in order to their being enlightened. A simple relation of the Lord's dealings with us, in bringing us, from opposing, to profess and promote his gospel, when delivered in a right spirit and manner, will sometimes make more impression that laboured speeches, even though it amounts not to the full proof of the truth, such as was shown in the change wrought in the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Hebrew tongue - See the notes on <a href="/acts/21-40.htm">Acts 21:40</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. when they heard &#8230; the Hebrew tongue&#8212;(See on [2090]Ac 21:40).<p>they kept the more silence&#8212;They could have understood him in Greek, and doubtless fully expected the renegade to address them in that language, but the sound of their holy mother tongue awed them into deeper silence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Hebrew tongue; </span> the ordinary Hebrew; that which was taken for Hebrew, and spoken by the Hebrews after their return from the captivity, though mixed with the Syriac; as <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/21-40.htm" title="And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people.

It was strikingly in harmony with his addressing them as "brethren" that he should speak to them in their own mother tongue. There is a living reality in such touches which seems at once to refute Renan's suspicion that St. Luke invented this and other of St. Paul's speeches in the later chapters of the Acts. The full report of these later speeches is abundantly accounted for by the fact that through this time St. Luke was with St. Paul, and heard the speeches. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Kept - silence (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., gave quiet. </body></html>
