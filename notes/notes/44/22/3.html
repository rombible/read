Paul relates the history of his early life very particularly; he notices that his conversion was wholly the act of God. Condemned sinners are struck blind by the power of darkness, and it is a lasting blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews. Convinced sinners are struck blind as Paul was, not by darkness, but by light. They are for a time brought to be at a loss within themselves, but it is in order to their being enlightened. A simple relation of the Lord's dealings with us, in bringing us, from opposing, to profess and promote his gospel, when delivered in a right spirit and manner, will sometimes make more impression that laboured speeches, even though it amounts not to the full proof of the truth, such as was shown in the change wrought in the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Born in Tarsus - See the notes on <a href="/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11</a>.<p>Brought up in this city - In Jerusalem, sent there for the advantage of more perfect instruction in the Law.<p>At the feet of Gamaliel - As a scholar or disciple of Gamaliel.

It is probable that the expression arose from the fact that the learners occupied a lower place or seat than the teacher. On the character and rank of Gamaliel, see the notes on <a href="/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a>.

By birth, a thorough genuine one; an Hebrew of the Hebrews, both by father and mother side, both parents being Jews, and so a true descendant from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: <p>born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia; See Gill on <a href="/acts/21-39.htm">Acts 21:39</a>. <p>yet brought up in this city; the city of Jerusalem; though Tarsus was the place of his birth, he had his education at Jerusalem: <p>at the feet of Gamaliel; of whom see <a href="/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a> it was the custom of scholars among the Jews, to sit at the feet of their masters, when instructed by them; see <a href="/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a> hence that saying of Jose ben Joezer (a); <p>"let thy house be an house of resort for the wise men, and be thou dusting thyself, , "with the dust of their feet":'' <p>which by one of their commentators (b) is interpreted two ways, either <p>"as if it was said that thou shouldst walk after them; for he that walks raises the dust with his feet, and he that goes after him is filled with the dust which he raises with his feet; or else that thou shouldst sit at their feet upon the ground, for so it was usual, that the master sat upon a bench, and the scholars sat at his feet upon the floor.'' <p>This latter sense is commonly understood, and adapted to the passage here, as illustrating it; though it may be, that the sense may only be this, that the apostle boarded in Gamaliel's house, ate at his table, and familiarly conversed with him; which he modestly expresses by being brought up at his feet, who was a man that was had in great reverence with the Jews; and this sense seems the rather to be the sense of the passage, since his learning is expressed in the next clause; and since; till after Gamaliel's time, it was not usual for scholars to sit when they learned; for the tradition is (c), that <p>"from the times of Moses to Rabban Gamaliel, they (the scholars) did not learn the law but standing; after Rabban Gamaliel died, sickness came into the world, and they learned the law sitting; and hence it is said, that after Rabban Gamaliel died, the glory of the law ceased.'' <p>It follows, <p>and taught according to the perfect law of the fathers; not the law which the Jewish fathers received from Moses, though Paul was instructed in this, but in the oral law, the "Misna", or traditions of the elders, in which he greatly profited, and exceeded others, <a href="/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>. <p>And was zealous towards God; or "a zealot of God"; one of those who were called "Kanaim", or zealots; who in their great zeal for the glory of God, took away the lives of men, when they found them guilty of what they judged a capital crime; see <a href="/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>.
