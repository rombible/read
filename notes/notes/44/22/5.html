(See Notes on <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>; <a href="/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>.) At the time which we have now reached, the office was filled by Ananias, son of Nebedseus, who owed his appointment to Herod Agrippa II., then King of Chalcis, to whom Claudius had conceded the privilege of nominating the high priests (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 5, § 2). The official acts of his predecessors would of course be known to the high priest for the time being, and St. Paul can therefore appeal to his knowledge as confirming his own statements.<p><span class= "bld">All the estate of the</span> <span class= "bld">elders.</span>—The word is perhaps used as identical with the Sanhedrin, or Council; perhaps, also, as including the <span class= "ital">Gerousia, </span>or “Senate,” of <a href="/acts/5-21.htm" title="And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.

Paul relates the history of his early life very particularly; he notices that his conversion was wholly the act of God. Condemned sinners are struck blind by the power of darkness, and it is a lasting blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews. Convinced sinners are struck blind as Paul was, not by darkness, but by light. They are for a time brought to be at a loss within themselves, but it is in order to their being enlightened. A simple relation of the Lord's dealings with us, in bringing us, from opposing, to profess and promote his gospel, when delivered in a right spirit and manner, will sometimes make more impression that laboured speeches, even though it amounts not to the full proof of the truth, such as was shown in the change wrought in the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As also the high priest ... - See the notes on <a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>.<p>All the estate of the elders - Greek: all the presbytery; that is, the whole body of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation.<p>Unto the brethren - The Jewish brethren who were at Damascus.

Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. xviii. 5, 3) tells us that in a.d. 37 Theophilus, son of Ananus, was made high priest in the place of his brother Jonathan. The high priest to whom St Paul here alludes was one of these two brothers, for Theophilus held office till he was removed by Agrippa and his place occupied by Simon, called Kantheras (see Jos. <span class="ital">Ant</span>, xix. 6, 2, and cp. Farrar’s <span class="ital">St Paul</span>, i. 178). Ananias was high priest at the time of St Paul’s arrest.
