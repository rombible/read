The Lord having chosen the sinner, that he should know his will, he is humbled, enlightened, and brought to the knowledge of Christ and his blessed gospel. Christ is here called that Just One; for he is Jesus Christ the righteous. Those whom God has chosen to know his will, must look to Jesus, for by him God has made known his good-will to us. The great gospel privilege, sealed to us by baptism, is the pardon of sins. Be baptized, and wash away thy sins; that is, receive the comfort of the pardon of thy sins in and through Jesus Christ, and lay hold on his righteousness for that purpose; and receive power against sin, for the mortifying of thy corruptions. Be baptized, and rest not in the sign, but make sure of the thing signified, the putting away of the filth of sin. The great gospel duty, to which by our baptism we are bound, is, to seek for the pardon of our sins in Christ's name, and in dependence on him and his righteousness. God appoints his labourers their day and their place, and it is fit they should follow his appointment, though it may cross their own will. Providence contrives better for us than we do for ourselves; we must refer ourselves to God's guidance. If Christ send any one, his Spirit shall go along with him, and give him to see the fruit of his labours. But nothing can reconcile man's heart to the gospel, except the special grace of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For thou shalt be his witness ... - As an apostle - to testify to all people that the Messiah has come, that he has died, that he has risen, and that he is the Saviour of the world.<p>Of what thou hast seen and heard - Of the remarkable proof which has been furnished you of the divine mission and character of the Lord Jesus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. that thou shouldest &#8230; see that&#8212;"the"<p>Just One&#8212;compare Ac 3:14; 7:52.<p>hear the voice of his mouth&#8212;in order to place him on a level with the other apostles, who had "seen the [risen] Lord."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His witness; </span> the apostles were in a more special manner Christ’s witnesses; as <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/24-48.htm" title="And you are witnesses of these things.">Luke 24:48</a> <a href="/john/1-7.htm" title="The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.">John 1:7</a> <a href="/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a></span>; God giving them extraordinary gifts, not for their own sakes chiefly, but to profit others withal; as the tree bears not fruit, nor the field yields its increase, for itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of what thou hast seen and heard; </span> not that St. Paul’s commission extended only to the publishing this wonder at his conversion: for he was intrusted with the gospel, and had that treasure in his earthen vessel: but this miracle is expressly mentioned, because it was unto him and others a great confirmation of the truths which he believed himself, and recommended to the faith of others.
