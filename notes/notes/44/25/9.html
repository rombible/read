The invitation was in itself plausible enough. It practically admitted that there was no evidence on the last head of the accusation of which he, as procurator, need take cognizance. It offered the prisoner a trial before his own national tribunal, with the presence of the procurator as a check upon violence and injustice. It is manifest from St. Paul’s answer that this was practically what Festus meant. The proposed trial would, he says, not be before Caesar’s judgment seat, and he, for his part, preferred the secular to the ecclesiastical tribunal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/25-9.htm" title="But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?...">Acts 25:9-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure </span>— To ingratiate himself with them by a popular action, at the beginning of his government; to gratify the prosecutors rather than the prisoner, as far as he could go with safety against one that was a citizen of Rome; <span class="ital">answered Paul, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem and there be judged? </span>— Festus could have ordered this without asking Paul. But God secretly overruled the whole, that he might have an occasion of appealing to Rome. In suffering times the prudence of the Lord’s people is tried as well as their patience. Being sent forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, they have need to be wise as serpents. <span class="ital">Then said Paul </span>— Apprehensive of the attempt which might be made upon his life in his journey, or in the city itself; <span class="ital">I stand at Cesar’s judgment-seat </span>— For all the courts of the Roman governors were held in the name of the emperor, and by commission from him; <span class="ital">where </span>— As a Roman citizen; <span class="ital">I ought to be judged </span>— And I insist upon my privilege of having my cause decided there; <span class="ital">to the Jews have I done no wrong </span>— In any respect whatever; <span class="ital">as thou very well knowest </span>— As thou must have perceived clearly by what has this day been examined before thee. Or, Festus might know that Paul had done the Jews no wrong, from the relation Felix had made unto him, as also from such as were present with Felix when Paul’s cause was heard. Thus it very well becomes those that are innocent to plead their innocence, and to insist upon it; it is a debt we owe to our own good name, not only not to bear false witness against ourselves, but to maintain our own integrity against those who bear false witness against us. <span class="ital">For if I be an offender, </span>&c. — If I have injured the Jews, and my fault be such as by law deserves death, I ask no favour; <span class="ital">I refuse not to die </span>— But will willingly accept the punishment of mine iniquity. <span class="ital">But if </span>— As I know in my own conscience, and as thou, from the course of this trial, hast the greatest reason to believe; <span class="ital">there be none of these things </span>— That is, that these things, <span class="ital">whereof </span>they <span class="ital">accuse me </span>— Have had no existence, and that their accusations proceed from malice, and are founded on falsehood; <span class="ital">no man may deliver me unto them </span>— Nor can, without palpable injustice. He expresses himself modestly, but his meaning is, Thou canst not deliver me to them; it being a governor’s business, as much to protect the innocent, as to punish the guilty. <span class="ital">I appeal unto Cesar</span> — Which any Roman citizen might do before sentence was passed. <span class="ital">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council </span>— It was customary for a considerable number of persons of distinction to attend the Roman governors into the provinces. These constituted a kind of council, with whom they frequently advised; <span class="ital">answered </span>— Having called in the prisoner; <span class="ital">Hast thou appealed unto Cesar? unto Cesar shalt thou go </span>— For how desirous soever I am to oblige the people of my province, I will never allow myself, upon any occasion, to violate the privileges of a Roman citizen. Festus, therefore, gave proper orders for conveying him to Rome as soon as possible, that he might be there presented before the emperor himself; and, in the mean time, Paul was remanded to his confinement, and his accusers returned to Jerusalem a second time, with the mortification of not having been able to accomplish their purpose against him. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-12 See how restless malice is. Persecutors deem it a peculiar favour to have their malice gratified. Preaching Christ, the end of the law, was no offence against the law. In suffering times the prudence of the Lord's people is tried, as well as their patience; they need wisdom. It becomes those who are innocent, to insist upon their innocence. Paul was willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let that take its course. If he deserved death, he would accept the punishment. But if none of the things whereof they accused him were true, no man could deliver him unto them, with justice. Paul is neither released nor condemned. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence takes; by which we are often made ashamed, both of our hopes and of our fears, and are kept waiting on God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure - Desirous of securing their favor, as he had just entered on his administration. Compare <a href="/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>. In this he evinced rather a desire of popularity than an inclination to do justice. Had he been disposed to do right at once, he would have immediately discharged Paul. Festus perceived that the case was one that did not come fairly within the jurisdiction of a Roman magistrate; that it pertained solely to the customs and questions among the Jews <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/25-18.htm">Acts 25:18-20</a>; and he therefore proposed that the case should be tried before him at Jerusalem. It is remarkable, however, that he had such a sense of justice and law as not to suffer the case to go out of his own hands. He proposed still to hear the cause, but asked Paul whether he was willing that it should be tried at Jerusalem. As the question which he asked Paul was one on which he was at liberty to take his own course, and as Paul had no reason to expect that his going to Jerusalem would facilitate the cause of justice, it is not remarkable that he declined the offer, as perhaps Festus supposed he would. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10.
