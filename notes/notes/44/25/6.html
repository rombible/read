Persecutors deem it a peculiar favour to have their malice gratified. Preaching Christ, the end of the law, was no offence against the law. In suffering times the prudence of the Lord's people is tried, as well as their patience; they need wisdom. It becomes those who are innocent, to insist upon their innocence. Paul was willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let that take its course. If he deserved death, he would accept the punishment. But if none of the things whereof they accused him were true, no man could deliver him unto them, with justice. Paul is neither released nor condemned. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence takes; by which we are often made ashamed, both of our hopes and of our fears, and are kept waiting on God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>More than ten days - See the margin.

Thus though God hath provided so, as there is little or no variety in setting down those truths or doctrines in Scripture which concern faith and manners, or our believing and holy living; yet in circumstances which (though they pertain to complete the history or genealogies in Scripture) are not necessary to be so exactly known, God left them not so, designed to exercise us in this state, wherein <span class="ital">we know</span> but <span class="ital">in part, </span>\ <a href="/1_corinthians/13-9.htm" title="For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.">1 Corinthians 13:9</a>.
