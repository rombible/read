Persecutors deem it a peculiar favour to have their malice gratified. Preaching Christ, the end of the law, was no offence against the law. In suffering times the prudence of the Lord's people is tried, as well as their patience; they need wisdom. It becomes those who are innocent, to insist upon their innocence. Paul was willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let that take its course. If he deserved death, he would accept the punishment. But if none of the things whereof they accused him were true, no man could deliver him unto them, with justice. Paul is neither released nor condemned. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence takes; by which we are often made ashamed, both of our hopes and of our fears, and are kept waiting on God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which among you are able - Enjoy all the advantages of just trial, and exhibit your accusations with all the learning and talent in your power.
