When we have faith, that most precious gift of God, we shall be delivered from the spiritual helplessness in which we were born, and from the dominion of sinful habits since formed; we shall be made able to stand upright and walk cheerfully in the ways of the Lord. When Christ, the Son of God, appeared in the likeness of men, and did many miracles, men were so far from doing sacrifice to him, that they made him a sacrifice to their pride and malice; but Paul and Barnabas, upon their working one miracle, were treated as gods. The same power of the god of this world, which closes the carnal mind against truth, makes errors and mistakes find easy admission. We do not learn that they rent their clothes when the people spake of stoning them; but when they spake of worshipping them; they could not bear it, being more concerned for God's honour than their own. God's truth needs not the services of man's falsehood. The servants of God might easily obtain undue honours if they would wink at men's errors and vices; but they must dread and detest such respect more than any reproach. When the apostles preached to the Jews, who hated idolatry, they had only to preach the grace of God in Christ; but when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must set right their mistakes in natural religion. Compare their conduct and declaration with the false opinions of those who think the worship of a God, under any name, or in any manner, is equally acceptable to the Lord Almighty. The most powerful arguments, the most earnest and affectionate addresses, even with miracles, are scarcely enough to keep men from absurdities and abominations; much less can they, without special grace, turn the hearts of sinners to God and to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there sat - There dwelt, <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a>; <a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a> (margin).

Comp. Baur, I. p. 112 ff. ed. 2. In a corresponding manner have the miracles of Paul generally been placed in parallelism with those of Peter, to the prejudice of their historical truth. Comp., in opposition to this view, Trip, <span class="ital">Paulus nach d. Apostelgesch</span>. p. 161 ff.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/14-8.htm" title="And there sat a certain man at Lystra, weak in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:">Acts 14:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν Λύστροις</span>: here neuter plural, and not as in <a href="/acts/14-6.htm" title="They were ware of it, and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the region that lies round about:">Acts 14:6</a>; <a href="/acts/14-21.htm" title="And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,">Acts 14:21</a>; feminine. Clemen, p. 115, and Jüngst, p. 131, see a proof in this that 8–18, or 21a, was interpolated by a redactor. But Hilgenfeld points out that the same interchange of feminine singular and neuter plural recurs in <a href="/context/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:...">Acts 16:1-2</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="/2_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Persecutions, afflictions, which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.">2 Timothy 3:11</a>. The miracle which follows has often been compared with those narrated in <a href="/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a> ff., and it has been alleged that this second miracle is a mere imitation of the first, to keep up the parallel between Peter and Paul. But whilst there are, no doubt, features in common in the two narratives—no great matter for surprise in similar healings, where a similarity of expressions would fitly recur, especially in the literary usage of a medical writer (see Zöckler, p. 240)—the differences are also marked: <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in the Petrine miracle the man is a beggar, and asks only for alms; in the Pauline nothing is said of all this, even if the first fact is implied—in the Petrine miracle nothing is said of the man’s faith, although it is implied (see notes, <span class="ital">in loco</span>); here it is distinctly stated—in the earlier miracle Peter is represented as taking the man and raising him up; here nothing of the kind is mentioned (see further on the two miracles, and the different motive in their performance, Nösgen, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 267). On St. Paul’s own claim to work miracles see <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>, <a href="/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>. If the latter passage occurs in an Epistle addressed amongst other Churches to Christians in Lystra, in accordance with the South Galatian theory, the assertion of miraculous powers is the more notable; see also McGiffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 189.—<span class="greekheb">ἀδύν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῖς π</span>.: adjective only here in N.T. in this sense, <span class="ital">cf.</span> LXX, . <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/2-10.htm" title="And I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall, and mine eyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes, and a whiteness came in mine eyes: and I went to the physicians, but they helped me not: moreover Achiacharus did nourish me, until I went into Elymais.">Tob 2:10</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/5-9.htm" title="So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.">Tob 5:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀδύν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς</span>.

There is no mention of a synagogue in Lystra, and it is very improbable that there was one. The Apostles therefore would seek out some place of public resort where they might proclaim their message, and such a position would also be most adapted for the purposes of a begging cripple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">at Lystra</span>] This place lay almost south from Iconium, if the site generally assigned to it, at the foot of the <span class="ital">Kara-dagh</span>, be the correct one.

We cannot conclude this absolutely from <a href="/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>, because both Derbe and Lystra are there mentioned, but in <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a> we have an enumeration in which are the words “Gaius of Derbe and Timotheus,” where the form of the expression makes it almost certain that the latter was not of Derbe. Further, when St Paul recalls to Timothy his sufferings undergone at this period (<a href="/context/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,...">2 Timothy 3:10-11</a>), he says “Thou hast fully known … the persecutions and afflictions which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra,” words which seem to connect Timothy with the last-named place, and when taken in connection with the other passages to be conclusive that Timothy did not live at Derbe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That Timothy was made a convert to Christianity at this first visit of St Paul is plain from <a href="/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>, where on the Apostle’s second visit he is called “a disciple.” It is also clear from the same passage (<a href="/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>) that there could have been but few Jews at Lystra at this time, or else the son of a religious Jewess would hardly have remained uncircumcised till he had reached man’s estate.
