The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent of the corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty that men are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease they are persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have been Mercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city. Thus men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive the truth in the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed in the faith; all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, and nothing less, effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It is true, we must count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement that we shall not be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power and grace the converts and the newly-established churches are commended, clearly was the Lord Jesus, on whom they had believed. It was an act of worship. The praise of all the little good we do at any time, must be ascribed to God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both to will and to do, but also worketh with us to make what we do successful. All who love the Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has opened the door of faith wide, to those who were strangers to him and to his salvation. And let us, like the apostles, abide with those who know and love the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Throughout Pisidia - See the note at <a href="/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14</a>.<p>They came to Pamphylia - See the notes on <a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>.

But as that would imply that this was done by the apostles' own hands, many render the word, as in our version, "ordained." Still, as there is no evidence in the New Testament that the word had then lost its proper meaning, as this is beyond doubt its meaning in 2Co 8:19, and as there is indisputable evidence that the concurrence of the people was required in all elections to sacred office in the earliest ages of the Church, it is perhaps better to understand the words to mean, "when they had made a choice of elders," that is, superintended such choice on the part of the disciples.<p>and had prayed with fasting&#8212;literally, "fastings," thus setting them solemnly apart. This last clause confirms our interpretation of the former. For if "ordination" was by prayer and fasting (see Ac 13:3), why should it be said they first "ordained elders," and after that "prayed with fasting?" Whereas if the first clause refer to the choice and the second to the ordination, all is natural.<p>they commended&#8212;"committed"<p>them&#8212;that is, all these churches.<p>to the Lord&#8212;Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Going the same way back which they had come, as appear by <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/13-13.htm" title="Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.">Acts 13:13</a>,14</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And after they had passed throughout Pisidia,....
