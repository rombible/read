Yet the success was not to be reckoned to the manner of their preaching, but to the Spirit of God who used that means. Perseverance in doing good, amidst dangers and hardships, is a blessed evidence of grace. Wherever God's servants are driven, they should seek to declare the truth. When they went on in Christ's name and strength, he failed not to give testimony to the word of his grace. He has assured us it is the word of God, and that we may venture our souls upon it. The Gentiles and Jews were at enmity with one another, yet united against Christians. If the church's enemies join to destroy it, shall not its friends unite for its preservation? God has a shelter for his people in a storm; he is, and will be their Hiding-place.

Hitherto the evil results indicated in <a href="/acts/14-2.htm" title="But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brothers.">Acts 14:2</a> had not resulted in an open combination of Jews and Gentiles to injure Paul and Barnabas, but now the Jews and their rulers were prepared to act in concert with the Gentiles, so that the opposition assumed a public shape, and a definite accusation of blasphemy could be formulated against the Apostles.—<span class="greekheb">ὁρμὴ</span>, “onset,” R.V.; “assault,” A.V., but neither word seems appropriate, since neither onset nor assault actually occurred. It seems therefore better to take the word as expressing the inclination, or hostile intention, or instigation, and to connect it with the infinitives. In classical Greek the word is used of eagerness (joined with <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>), of impulse, of eager desire of, or for, a thing, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Thuc. iv. 4, Plat., <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, 35 D, although it is also used of an assault or attack.

Hesychius regards it as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">βουλή</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span> but see also for its use as expressing attack, violence, 3Ma 1:16; 3Ma 1:23; 3Ma 4:5.—<span class="greekheb">σὺν τοῖς ἄρχουσιν αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, of the Jewish synagogues, as <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> shows. Hackett and Lumby take it of the heathen magistrates. On the distinction between these and the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχισυνάγωγος</span>, see Schürer, div. ii., vol. ii., pp. 64, 250, E.T. The magistrates of the city could not have participated in an act of mob-violence, and the plot to <span class="ital">stone</span> the Apostles seems to point to Jewish instigation for enforcing the punishment of blasphemy.—<span class="greekheb">ὑβρίσαι</span>, “to entreat them shamefully,” so A. and R.V., indicating outrage, insolence in act, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/22-6.htm" title="And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.">Matthew 22:6</a>, <a href="/luke/18-32.htm" title="For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:">Luke 18:32</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-42.htm" title="Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:">2Ma 14:42</a>, 3Ma 6:9; in <a href="/luke/11-45.htm" title="Then answered one of the lawyers, and said to him, Master, thus saying you reproach us also.">Luke 11:45</a> of insulting words.

It rather applies to the excitement, urging, and instigation which the Jews were applying to their heathen companions, and which was likely to end in violence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with their rulers</span>] The word is of the most general character, and it is impossible to form any conjecture from it what these authorities <span class="bld">were</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and to stone them</span>] From this we see that the prompting came from the Jews. Stoning was their mode of punishment for blasphemy, and such they would represent the teaching of the Apostles to be. We need not suppose that any regular legal stoning like that of Stephen was intended, or that to accomplish that object the rulers here mentioned were such Jewish authorities as could be gathered together in Iconium, and that they are indicated by a vague term because they had no very settled position. The previous verb “to use them despitefully” rather points to the opposite conclusion, and marks the intended proceeding as a piece of mob-outrage, for which the countenance of any authority was gladly welcomed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In connection with St Paul’s residence at Iconium, there exists a story of the conversion of a maiden named Thecla, of which the apocryphal “Acts of Paul and Thecla” represents the form into which the legend had grown in the fourth century. Thecla, who was espoused to Thamyris, is said to have been deeply affected by the preaching of the Apostle, which she accidentally heard, and when the Apostle was put in prison on the accusation of being a magician, she bribed the gaoler and visited the prisoner, and was fully instructed by him in the Christian faith. The Apostle was punished and sent away from Iconium. Thecla was condemned to die for her refusal to marry Thamyris, but was miraculously saved, and after many troubles joined St Paul in his missionary travels, and ultimately made her home in the neighbourhood of Seleucia, where she led the life of a nun till her death, which took place when she was ninety years old.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This story may at first have had some basis of truth to rest on, but it has been so distorted with inconsistent details, that it is impossible now to judge what the foundation of it may have been.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">Made an onset</span> for <span class="accented">an assault made</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of the Jews</span> for <span class="accented">also of the Jews</span>, A.V.; to <span class="accented">entreat them shamefully</span> for to use <span class="accented">them despitefully</span>, A.V., as <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>.
