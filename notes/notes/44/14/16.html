We have here the first germ of what may be fairly described as St. Paul’s philosophy of history. The times of ignorance had been permitted by God, and those who had lived in them would be equitably dealt with, and judged according to their knowledge. The same thought meets us again in the speech at Athens (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>). In Romans 1, 2, 11, we meet with it, in an expanded form, as a more complete vindication of the righteousness of God. The ignorance and the sins of the Gentile world had been allowed to run their course, as the Law had been allowed to do its partial and imperfect work among the Jews, as parts, if one may so speak, of a great divine drama, leading both to feel the need of redemption, and preparing both for its reception. All were included in unbelief that God might have mercy upon all (<a href="/romans/11-32.htm" title="For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.">Romans 11:32</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:8-18 All things are possible to those that believe. When we have faith, that most precious gift of God, we shall be delivered from the spiritual helplessness in which we were born, and from the dominion of sinful habits since formed; we shall be made able to stand upright and walk cheerfully in the ways of the Lord. When Christ, the Son of God, appeared in the likeness of men, and did many miracles, men were so far from doing sacrifice to him, that they made him a sacrifice to their pride and malice; but Paul and Barnabas, upon their working one miracle, were treated as gods. The same power of the god of this world, which closes the carnal mind against truth, makes errors and mistakes find easy admission. We do not learn that they rent their clothes when the people spake of stoning them; but when they spake of worshipping them; they could not bear it, being more concerned for God's honour than their own. God's truth needs not the services of man's falsehood. The servants of God might easily obtain undue honours if they would wink at men's errors and vices; but they must dread and detest such respect more than any reproach. When the apostles preached to the Jews, who hated idolatry, they had only to preach the grace of God in Christ; but when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must set right their mistakes in natural religion. Compare their conduct and declaration with the false opinions of those who think the worship of a God, under any name, or in any manner, is equally acceptable to the Lord Almighty. The most powerful arguments, the most earnest and affectionate addresses, even with miracles, are scarcely enough to keep men from absurdities and abominations; much less can they, without special grace, turn the hearts of sinners to God and to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who in times past - Previous to the gospel; in past ages.<p>Suffered all nations - Permitted all nations; that is, all Gentiles, <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>.

They were permitted to follow their own reason and passions, and their own system of religion. God gave them no written laws, and sent to them no messengers. Why he did this we cannot determine. It might have been, among other reasons, to show to the world conclusively:<p>(1) The insufficiency of reason to guide people in the matters of religion. The experiment was made under the most favorable circumstances. The most enlightened nations, the Greeks and Romans, were left to pursue the inquiry, and failed no less than the most degraded tribes of people.

In all nations, in all circumstances, people had shown the same alienation from God.

It has been thought that the words <span class="greekheb">οὐρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν διδούς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. are rhythmical, and may have been some familiar fragment of a song, or a citation from a Greek poet, in which the Apostle expressed his thoughts; others have maintained that they may have formed part of the hymn sung in the procession for the sacrifice, and that St. Paul made the words his text; see Humphry, <span class="ital">in loco;</span> Farrar, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, i., p. 384; Felten, <span class="ital">in loco;</span> but it may be fairly said that the O.T. language was in itself quite sufficient to suggest the Apostle’s words.
