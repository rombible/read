Observe, the multitude of them that err, does not turn error into truth. Though all nations practised idolatry, yet every kind and species of it is founded on a lie. <span class="ital">Nevertheless </span>— Though even then; <span class="ital">he left not himself without witness </span>— Of his being, perfections, and providence, in any country. Besides the witness for God within them, the dictates of conscience, they had witnesses for God around them, in the bounties of his providence. Their not having inspired teachers among them, nor the Holy Scriptures, did in part excuse them; and therefore God did not destroy them for their idolatry, as he did the Jewish nation. But that did not wholly excuse them; notwithstanding it they were deeply criminal before God: for there were other witnesses for God, sufficient to inform them that he, and he only, was to be worshipped; and that to him they owed all their services, from whom they received all their comforts, and therefore were guilty of the highest injustice and ingratitude imaginable, in alienating their services from him. <span class="ital">In that he did good </span>— To all his creatures, with a bountiful hand, and especially to mankind. Even by punishments God testifies of himself: but more peculiarly by benefits. <span class="ital">And gave us </span>— All, whether Jews or Gentiles; <span class="ital">rain from heaven and fruitful seasons </span>— Which could not come by chance, nor were caused by the vain idols of the heathen. Observe, reader, 1st, All the powers of nature witness to us a sovereign power in the God of nature, from whom they are derived, and on whom they depend. It is not the heaven that gives us rain, but God that gives us rain from heaven. 2d, The benefits which we have, by these powers of nature, witness to us that we ought to make our acknowledgments, not to the creatures that are made serviceable to us, but to the Creator, who makes them so. God seems to reckon the instances of his <span class="ital">goodness </span>to be more cogent proofs of his title to our homage and adoration, than the evidences of his <span class="ital">greatness; </span>for his goodness is his glory. “As a friend, in sending us frequent presents, expresses his remembrance of us and affection to us, though he neither speak nor write to us; so all the gifts of the divine bounty, which are scattered abroad on every side, are so many witnesses sent to attest the divine care and goodness, and they speak it in very sensible language to the heart, though not to the ear.” <span class="ital">And with these sayings </span>— Plain and reasonable as they were; <span class="ital">scarce restrained they the people </span>— From their purpose of sacrificing to them. So strongly were idolaters in love with their idolatrous practices!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:8-18 All things are possible to those that believe. When we have faith, that most precious gift of God, we shall be delivered from the spiritual helplessness in which we were born, and from the dominion of sinful habits since formed; we shall be made able to stand upright and walk cheerfully in the ways of the Lord. When Christ, the Son of God, appeared in the likeness of men, and did many miracles, men were so far from doing sacrifice to him, that they made him a sacrifice to their pride and malice; but Paul and Barnabas, upon their working one miracle, were treated as gods. The same power of the god of this world, which closes the carnal mind against truth, makes errors and mistakes find easy admission. We do not learn that they rent their clothes when the people spake of stoning them; but when they spake of worshipping them; they could not bear it, being more concerned for God's honour than their own. God's truth needs not the services of man's falsehood. The servants of God might easily obtain undue honours if they would wink at men's errors and vices; but they must dread and detest such respect more than any reproach. When the apostles preached to the Jews, who hated idolatry, they had only to preach the grace of God in Christ; but when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must set right their mistakes in natural religion. Compare their conduct and declaration with the false opinions of those who think the worship of a God, under any name, or in any manner, is equally acceptable to the Lord Almighty. The most powerful arguments, the most earnest and affectionate addresses, even with miracles, are scarcely enough to keep men from absurdities and abominations; much less can they, without special grace, turn the hearts of sinners to God and to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the priest of Jupiter - He whose office it was to conduct the worship of Jupiter by offering sacrifices, etc.<p>Which was before their city - The word "which" here refers not to the priest, but to Jupiter.

Not that the priest was before the city, but Jupiter; and the phrase denotes either his presidency over the city, and so the Arabic version renders it, "who was the chief god of their city"; or the place where his image stood, which was out of the city, and so may be said to be before it; accordingly the Syriac version renders it, "who was without the city"; he who officiated as priest to him: <p>brought oxen and garlands unto the gates; either "of the city", as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions add, where was the statue of Jupiter; or else, and which is most likely, he brought them to the gates of the house, where Paul and Barnabas were; and to this sense the Syriac version renders it, "to the door of the dwelling place where they abode": what the oxen were brought for is easy to conceive, had it not been expressed; but for what should garlands or crowns be brought? These were used in sacrifices, for different purposes; sometimes they crowned the gods (t), to whom they sacrificed, and these might be brought to be put upon the heads of Paul and Barnabas; and sometimes the priests wore them (u), and which seems to be in imitation of the mitre, wore by the high priest among the Jews; and sometimes even those who came to sacrifice, and implore the assistance of their deities, wore them (w); likewise the altars on which they offered sacrifice were crowned with these garlands (x); and the sacrifices themselves, and which last seems to be the case here: the garlands were brought to be put upon the oxen; and these were for the most part made of cypress; sometimes of the pine tree, and sometimes of other leaves and flowers, such as were peculiar to the gods (y): and there was something like this among the Jews, at the offerings of their first fruits, which were done in this manner (z); <p>"they that were nearest (to Jerusalem) brought green figs and grapes; and they that were more remote brought dried figs and raisins; and an ox went before them, whose horns were covered with gold,  , "and a crown of olives" on his head; a pipe sounded before them, till they came near to Jerusalem, and then they sent some before them, who "crowned" their first fruits.'' <p>And would have done sacrifice with the people; that is, the priest and the people with him, would have offered sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas, as to two deities; and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions add, "to them"; to both the apostles, with which agrees the Arabic version. <p>(t) Baruch vi. 9.

Ramsay defends (p. 118), and points out that at each of the great temples in Asia Minor a college of priests would be in regular service: see also <span class="ital">Church in the Roman Empire</span>, pp. 52, 53.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ ὄντος πρὸ τῆς π</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, see critical notes. R.V., omitting <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, renders “whose <span class="ital">temple</span> was before the city,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, enshrined in the temple outside the gate as the protecting deity. Zöckler, with Ramsay, compares “<span class="greekheb">Ζωῦς Προάστιος</span>” on an inscription at Claudiopolis, <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <span class="greekheb">παρὰ Διΐ</span> (= ad fanum Jovis), <span class="greekheb">παρʼ Ἥρῃ</span>, and modern, the name of a church in Rome, “S.

In this phrase, as read in , the force of the participle is retained in a way characteristic of Acts, as almost = <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ὀνομαζομένου</span>: see on <a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>, a characteristic lost by the transposition of <span class="greekheb">ὄντος</span>; see on the whole question Ramsay, <span class="ital">Church in the Roman Empire</span>, p. 51 ff., and also on the possible site of the temple. The words cannot refer to the statue of Jupiter (so lately Rendall), to which no priests would be attached. See Blass in <span class="ital">Studien u.

The words do not refer to the Apostles; the aim seems to be indicated in <span class="greekheb">ἤθελε θύειν</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τοὺς πυλῶνας</span>: some see a reference to the gates of the city, mainly because of the collocation <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ὄντος πρὸ τῆς Π</span>. Blass supposes that the priest came from the temple outside to the city gates, but in that case Ramsay urges that Lucan usage would = <span class="greekheb">πύλη</span> rather than <span class="greekheb">πυλών</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/9-24.htm" title="But their laying await was known of Saul.

Others again refer the words to the gates leading into the <span class="ital">atrium</span> or courtyard of the house in which the Apostles were lodging, partly on the ground that the word <span class="greekheb">ἐξεπήδησαν</span> is best referred to the house (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/14-17.htm" title="After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when he found her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried,">Jdt 14:17</a>, and Susannah, Acts ver. 39).

The temple was just outside the gates; the lame man, it is likely, sat inside near the gates through which men were passing in and out. Paul and Barnabas would address the -people in the square or open space inside the gates. Seeing a stir at the gates, and hearing that it was the priest of Jupiter coming with oxen and garlands to sacrifice to them, they immediately ran forward to prevent it. The ox was the proper sacrifice for Jupiter. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of Jupiter (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Properly, the Jupiter, the tutelary deity of Lystra.
