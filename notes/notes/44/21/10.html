There was, at any rate, time for the tidings of his arrival to reach Jerusalem, and for Agabus (see Note on <a href="/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>) to come down in consequence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/21-10.htm" title="And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus....">Acts 21:10-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">And as we tarried there many days </span>— There being many disciples in that city, the fruit, as appears, of the ministry and miracles of Philip; <span class="ital">there came from Judea a prophet named Agabus — </span>Paul, and some part of his company, had become acquainted with this prophet some years before, at Antioch, where he foretold the famine which afterward happened in the days of Claudius Cesar, <a href="/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>. <span class="ital">And when he was come unto us </span>— Several of the disciples of Cesarea and Paul’s friends being together; <span class="ital">he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet </span>— In the manner that malefactors were wont to be bound when apprehended; <span class="ital">and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost </span>— By whose inspiration I now speak and act; <span class="ital">So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle — </span>Thus Agabus, like the prophets of old, accompanied his prediction with a significant prophetic symbol: and thus the nearer the event was, the more express and impressive were the predictions intended to prepare Paul for it. <span class="ital">When we </span>— Of Paul’s company; <span class="ital">and they of that place </span>— The brethren of Cesarea; <span class="ital">heard these things </span>— And believed if he went to Jerusalem the prediction would be fulfilled; we <span class="ital">besought him not to go </span>— In the most pressing manner, and with many tears of sincere and fervent affection, <a href="/acts/21-13.htm" title="Then Paul answered, What mean you to weep and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.">Acts 21:13</a>; being ignorant, it appears, that this and the former prediction were intended, not to hinder him from going to Jerusalem, but to make him the more courageous, by signifying to him beforehand what was to befall him, (<a href="/context/acts/20-22.htm" title="And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:...">Acts 20:22-23</a>,) and that he would not be put to death at Jerusalem. <span class="ital">Then Paul </span>— Sensibly touched with the concern which they expressed on his account, and yet resolutely bent upon following what he apprehended to be the call of duty, whatever sufferings it might expose him to; <span class="ital">answered, What mean ye to weep and break my heart? </span>— By these affectionate salutations? Observe, reader, the admirable mixture of tenderness and firmness of spirit manifested in this answer. <span class="ital">I am ready, not to be bound only </span>— And cast into prison; <span class="ital">but also to die at Jerusalem </span>— Or wherever else I may be called to it; <span class="ital">for the name of the Lord Jesus </span>— For he feared neither sufferings nor death in any form, if he might thereby defend the gospel, and promote the glory of its Author, which were the ends he had chiefly in view in all his labours and sufferings, and which he preferred to all other things whatever. <span class="ital">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased </span>— It was not obstinacy in Paul that hindered his yielding to their persuasions, but true Christian resolution, not to relinquish what he believed to be the line of duty. We should never be persuaded either to do what we know to be evil, or to omit what we believe to be good, when it is in our power: <span class="ital">saying, The will of the Lord be done — </span>Which they were satisfied Paul knew.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:8-18 Paul had express warning of his troubles, that when they came, they might be no surprise or terror to him. The general notice given us, that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God, should be of the same use to us. Their weeping began to weaken and slacken his resolution Has not our Master told us to take up our cross? It was a trouble to him, that they should so earnestly press him to do that in which he could not gratify them without wronging his conscience. When we see trouble coming, it becomes us to say, not only, The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy; but, Let the will of the Lord be done; for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth all according to the counsel of it. When a trouble is come, this must allay our griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it coming, this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be done; and we ought to say, Amen, let it be done. It is honourable to be an old disciple of Jesus Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of God to continue long in a course of duty, stedfast in the faith, growing more and more experienced, to a good old age. And with these old disciples one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their years shall teach wisdom. Many brethren at Jerusalem received Paul gladly. We think, perhaps, that if we had him among us, we should gladly receive him; but we should not, if, having his doctrine, we do not gladly receive that.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There came down - See the notes on <a href="/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>.<p>Named Agabus - See the notes on <a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. tarried there many&#8212;"a good many"<p>days&#8212;Finding himself in good time for Pentecost at Jerusalem, he would feel it a refreshing thing to his spirit to hold Christian communion for a few days with such a family.<p>there came down from Judea&#8212;the news of Paul's arrival having spread.<p>a certain prophet &#8230; Agabus&#8212;no doubt the same as in Ac 11:28.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Of whom mention is made, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a></span>; of whose prophecy they could not be ignorant, by reason of the great collection which, on that account, was made for the poor at Jerusalem. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as we tarried there many days,....
