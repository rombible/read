God had honoured him more than any of the apostles, yet they did not envy him; but on the contrary, glorified the Lord. They could not do more to encourage Paul to go on cheerfully in his work. James and the elders of the church at Jerusalem, asked Paul to gratify the believing Jews, by some compliance with the ceremonial law. They thought it was prudent in him to conform thus far. It was great weakness to be so fond of the shadows, when the substance was come. The religion Paul preached, tended not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. He preached Christ, the end of the law for righteousness, and repentance and faith, in which we are to make great use of the law. The weakness and evil of the human heart strongly appear, when we consider how many, even of the disciples of Christ, had not due regard to the most eminent minister that even lived. Not the excellence of his character, nor the success with which God blessed his labours, could gain their esteem and affection, seeing that he did not render the same respect as themselves to mere ceremonial observances. How watchful should we be against prejudices! The apostles were not free from blame in all they did; and it would be hard to defend Paul from the charge of giving way too much in this matter. It is vain to attempt to court the favour of zealots, or bigots to a party. This compliance of Paul did not answer, for the very thing by which he hoped to pacify the Jews, provoked them, and brought him into trouble. But the all-wise God overruled both their advice and Paul's compliance with it, to serve a better purpose than was intended. It was in vain to think of pleasing men who would be pleased with nothing but the rooting out of Christianity. Integrity and uprightness will be more likely to preserve us than insincere compliances. And it should warn us not to press men to doing what is contrary to their own judgment to oblige us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Them take - Take with you. Join yourself with them.<p>And purify thyself with them - Join them in observing the forms of purification prescribed by the Law of Moses in the observance of the vow of the Nazarite. The purifying here refers to the vows of sanctity which the Nazarites were to observe. They were to abstain from wine and strong drink; they were to eat no grapes, moist or dried; they were to come near no dead body, nor to make themselves "unclean" for their father, mother, brother, or sister, when they died <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3-7</a>; and they were to present an offering when the days of the vow were completed, <a href="/numbers/6-8.htm">Numbers 6:8</a>.<p>And be at charges with them - Share with them the expense of the offerings required when the vow is completed. Those offerings were a ram of a year old for a burnt-offering, a sheep of the same age for a sin-offering, a ram for a thank-offering, a basket of unleavened cakes, and a libation of wine. See <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/6-13.htm">Numbers 6:13-20</a>.<p>That they may shave their heads - The shaving of the head, or the cutting off the hair which had been suffered to grow during the continuance of the vow <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>, was an observance indicating that the vow had been performed. Paul was requested to join with them in the expense of the offerings, that thus, the whole of the ceremonies having been observed, their heads might be shaved as an indication that every part of the vow had been complied with.<p>And all may know - By the fact of your observance of one of the rites of the Mosaic religion, all may have evidence that it is not your purpose or practice to speak contemptuously of those rites, or to undervalue the authority of Moses.<p>Are nothing - Are untrue, or without any foundation.<p>Walkest orderly - That you live in accordance with the real requirements of the Law of Moses. To walk, in the Scriptures, often denotes "to live, to act, to conduct in a certain manner." All, probably, that they wished Paul to show by this was, that he was not an enemy of Moses. They who gave this counsel were Christians, and they could not wish him to do anything which would imply that he was not a Christian. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. be at charges with them&#8212;that is, defray the expense of the sacrifices legally required of them, along with his own, which was deemed a mark of Jewish generosity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Purify thyself; </span> they advise Paul to perform all those rites required of a Nazarite, the observation of which did legally purify him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Be at charges with them; </span> these charges were about the threefold sacrifice which were to be offered, two turtles or young pigeons, a lamb, unleavened bread, and cakes of fine flour, as <span class="bld"><a href="/context/numbers/6-10.htm" title="And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:...">Numbers 6:10-12</a>,15</span>: and the other four, spoken of <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/21-23.htm" title="Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;">Acts 21:23</a></span>, being poor, they require Paul here to bear their charges also, that so he might appear to be the chief amongst them, and the more zealous in their law, to take away the scandal that was taken up by the Jews against him; these ceremonies being as yet not deadly, or evil, though they were dead and indifferent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shave their heads; </span> which was done at the end of their separation, and was the accomplishment of all; and they burned the hair which they shaved off under their sacrifices, to show, that all their legal performances were only acceptable unto God through Jesus Christ, who was sacrificed for us, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened.

But how far the obligation of the vow extended in such a case is not clear (Edersheim, <span class="ital">Temple and its Services</span>, p. 326), and the time specified does not seem to allow for the commencement and completion of a vow on the part of the Apostle, although we cannot satisfactorily explain such expressions as the one before us, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἡγνισμένον</span>, <a href="/acts/24-18.htm" title="Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.">Acts 24:18</a>, on the supposition that St. Paul only associated himself with the company of the four votaries and incurred the expenses of their sacrifices.

As regards the transaction recommended by James, Kypke (quoted by Meyer) says, "It was a received thing among the Jews, and was reckoned an act of eminent piety, for a rich man to undertake to bear, on behalf of poor Nazarites, the expense of those sacrifices which they had to offer when they shaved their heads at the expiration of their vow." Josephus seems to allude to the custom, and to speak of King Agrippa as acting in accordance with it, when he says of him that he ordered great numbers of Nazarites to be shaved ('Ant. Jud.,' 19. 6:1). The sacrifices were costly, consisting of" three beasts, one for a burnt offering, another for a sin offering, and a third for a peace offering" (Lightfoot, vol. 9. p. 307). Alexander Jannaeus is said to have contributed nine hundred victims for three hundred Nazarites ('Dict. of Bible,' under "Nazarite;" comp. 1 Macc. 3:49). <span class="cmt_word">Purify thyself</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, the word used in the LXX. of <a href="/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2, 3, 8</a> (with its compound <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and co-derivatives <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) for the corresponding Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, to take the Nazarite vow.

Pay the necessary charges on their account. Hence Rev., rightly, "for them." The person who thus paid the expenses of poor devotees who could not afford the necessary charges shared the vow so far that he was required to stay with the Nazarites until the time of the vow had expired. "For a week, then, St. Paul, if he accepted the advice of James and the presbyters, would have to live with four paupers in the chamber of the temple which was set apart for this purpose; and then to pay for sixteen sacrificial animals and the accompanying meat-offerings" (Farrar, "Life and Work of Paul"). He must also stand among the Nazarites during the offering of the sacrifices, and look on while their heads were shaved, and while they took their hair to burn it under the caldron of the peace-offerings, "and while the priest took four sodden shoulders of rams, and four unleavened cakes out of the four baskets, and four unleavened wafers anointed with oils and put them on the hands of the Nazarites, and waved them for a wave-offering before the Lord" (Farrar).<p>Walkest orderly (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>See on elements, <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>. </body></html>
