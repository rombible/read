Wherever Paul came, he inquired what disciples were there, and found them out. Foreseeing his troubles, from love to him, and concern for the church, they wrongly thought it would be most for the glory of God that he should continue at liberty; but their earnestness to dissuade him from it, renders his pious resolution the more illustrious. He has taught us by example, as well as by rule, to pray always, to pray without ceasing.

See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>. God is everywhere, and can as easily hear prayer on the seashore as in the most magnificent temple. This is an instance, as well as that in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36</a>, where the apostle evidently prayed with the church without a form of prayer. No man can believe that he thus poured forth the desires of his heart at parting, and commended them to God in a prescribed form of words. Scenes like this show more clearly than abstract arguments could do that such a form was not needed, and would not be used. Paul and his fellow-Christians, on the sand of the sea-shore, would pour forth the gushing emotions of their souls in language such as their circumstances would suggest, and no man can read this narrative in a dispassionate manner without believing that they offered an extempore prayer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. they all brought us on our way with wives and children &#8230; and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed&#8212;(See on [2082]Ac 20:36).
