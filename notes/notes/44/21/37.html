They falsely charged him with ill doctrine and ill practice against the Mosaic ceremonies. It is no new thing for those who mean honestly and act regularly, to have things laid to their charge which they know not and never thought of. It is common for the wise and good to have that charged against them by malicious people, with which they thought to have obliged them. God often makes those a protection to his people, who have no affection to them, but only have compassion for sufferers, and regard to the public peace. And here see what false, mistaken notions of good people and good ministers, many run away with. But God seasonably interposes for the safety of his servants, from wicked and unreasonable men; and gives them opportunities to speak for themselves, to plead for the Redeemer, and to spread abroad his glorious gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>May I speak unto thee? - May I have the privilege of making my defense before thee; or of stating the case truly; the cause of my accusation; of this tumult, etc.<p>Canst thou speak Greek? - Implying that if he could, he might be permitted to speak to him. The Greek language was what was then almost universally spoken, and it is not improbable that it was the native tongue of the chief captain. It is evident that he was not a Roman by birth, for he says <a href="/acts/22-28.htm">Acts 22:28</a> that he had obtained the privilege of citizenship by paying a great sum. The language which the Jews spoke was the Syro-Chaldaic; and as he took Paul to be an Egyptian Jew <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-38.htm">Acts 21:38</a>, he supposed, from that circumstance also, that he was not able to speak the Greek language. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37-40.

Just as he was got up to the top of the steps, or stairs, that led up to the castle, and was about to go into the door of it: <p>he said unto the chief captain, may I speak unto thee? the apostle was one that had had a good education, and was a man of address, and this his modest and respectful way of speaking to the chief captain shows; and the question he put to him, was in the Greek language: hence it follows, <p>who said to him, canst thou speak Greek? or "dost thou know the Hellenistic language?" which the Jews who were born and lived in Greece spoke; hence such were called Hellenists; see <a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a> of this language we read in the Talmud (h); <p>"R. Levi bar Chajethah went to Caesarea, and heard them reading "Shema", (hear O Israel), &amp;c. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a> Nytoynwla in the Hellenistic language; he sought to hinder them; R. Rose heard of it, and was angry; and said, he that knows not to read in the Hebrew language, must he not read at all? yea, he may read in whatsoever language he understands.'' <p>The nearest to this language spoken by the Jews dispersed in Greece, must be the Greek language, in which Jews have written; as the books of the Old Testament translated by the "seventy" interpreters, who were Jews; and indeed it was this Bible which the Jews called Hellenists made use of; and the writings of Josephus, and Philo the Jew of Alexandria, and even the books of the New Testament, which are written by Jews; and Paul being a Jew of Tarsus, and so an Hellenist, could speak this language; as he did, when he disputed against the Hellenists, in <a href="/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29</a>. This the chief captain said, either as wondering to hear him speak Greek, when he thought he had been a Jerusalem Jew, or rather an Egyptian, as in the next verse; or it may be he put this question to him, as choosing rather that he should speak in Greek, it being the language he might best understand himself, and was the least known to the people, who he might not care should hear what he had to say; since if he took him for the Egyptian, the Greek tongue was what was chiefly spoken by such. <p>(h) T.

Defeated with his followers by the procurator Felix, he had taken to flight (Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell</span>. ii. 13. 5, <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xx. 8. 6); and therefore Lysias, in consequence of his remembrance of this event still fresh after the lapse of a considerable time,[132] lighted on the idea that the dreaded enthusiast, now returned or drawn forth from his long concealment, had fallen into the hands of popular fury.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τετρακισχιλ</span>.] Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell. l.c</span>. gives the followers of the Egyptian at <span class="greekheb">τρισμυρίους</span>; but this is only an apparent inconsistency with our passage, for here there is only brought forward a single, specially remarkable appearance of the rebel, perhaps the first step which he took with his most immediate and most dangerous followers, and therefore the reading in Josephus is not to be changed in accordance with our passage (in opposition to Kuinoel and Olshausen).[133]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How greatly under the worthless Felix the evil <span class="ital">of banditti</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῶν σικαρίων</span>, the <span class="ital">daggermen</span>, see Suicer, <span class="ital">Thes</span>.

But this contradiction is simply chargeable to Josephus himself, as the incompatibility of his statements discloses a historical error, concerning which our passage shows decisively that it was committed either in the assertion that <span class="ital">the greater part</span> were captured or slain, or in the statement of the numbers in <span class="ital">Antt. l.c</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/21-37.htm" title="And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to you?
