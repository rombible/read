The mention of the distance, and the measure of distance employed are, both of them, remarkable, and suggest the thought that St. Luke’s reckoning was a different one from that which Christendom has commonly received, and that the “forty days” expired before the last renewal of our Lord’s intercourse with His disciples, and that this ended on the following sabbath—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>eight days before the day of Pentecost. On this supposition we get a reason, otherwise wanting, for this manner of stating the distance. Symbolically, too, there seems a fitness in our Lord’s entering into His rest, on the great day of rest, which is wanting in our common way of reckoning. On the other hand, it may be noted that it is after St. Luke’s manner as in the case of Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm" title="And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.">Luke 24:13</a>) to give distances. The “Sabbath day’s journey” was reckoned at 2,000 paces, or about six furlongs.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/acts/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE ASCENSION<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/acts/1-1.htm" title="The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,">Acts 1:1</a> - <a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Ascension is twice narrated by Luke. The life begun by the supernatural birth ends with the supernatural Ascension, which sets the seal of Heaven on Christ’s claims and work. Therefore the Gospel ends with it. But it is also the starting-point of the Christ’s heavenly activity, of which the growth of His Church, as recorded in the Acts, is the issue. Therefore the Book of the Acts of the Apostles begins with it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The keynote of the ‘treatise’ lies in the first words, which describe the Gospel as the record of what ‘Jesus <span class="ital">began</span> to do and teach,’ Luke would have gone on to say that this second book of his contained the story of what Jesus went on to do and teach after He was ‘taken up,’ if he had been strictly accurate, or had carried out his first intention, as shown by the mould of his introductory sentence; but he is swept on into the full stream of his narrative, and we have to infer the contrast between his two volumes from his statement of the contents of his first.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The book, then, is misnamed Acts of the Apostles, both because the greater number of the Apostles do nothing in it, and because, in accordance with the hint of the first verse, Christ Himself is the doer of all, as comes out distinctly in many places where the critical events of the Church’s progress and extension are attributed to ‘the Lord.’ In one aspect, Christ’s work on earth was finished on the Cross; in another, that finished work is but the beginning both of His doing and teaching. Therefore we are not to regard His teaching while on earth as the completion of Christian revelation. To set aside the Epistles on the plea that the Gospels contain Christ’s own teaching, while the Epistles are only Paul’s or John’s, is to misconceive the relation between the earthly and the heavenly activity of Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The statement of the theme of the book is followed by a brief summary of the events between the Resurrection and Ascension. Luke had spoken of these in the end of his Gospel, but given no note of time, and run together the events of the day of the Resurrection and of the following weeks, so that it might appear, as has been actually contended that he meant, that the Ascension took place on the very day of Resurrection. The fact that in this place he gives more detailed statements, and tells how long elapsed between the Resurrection Sunday and the Ascension, might have taught hasty critics that an author need not be ignorant of what he does not mention, and that a detailed account does not contradict a summary one,-truths which do not seem very recondite, but have often been forgotten by very learned commentators.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Three points are signalised as occupying the forty days: commandments were given, Christ’s actual living presence was demonstrated {by sight, touch, hearing, etc.}, and instructions concerning the kingdom were imparted. The old blessed closeness and continuity of companionship had ceased. Our Lord’s appearances were now occasional. He came to the disciples, they knew not whence; He withdrew from them, they knew not whither. Apparently a sacred awe restrained them from seeking to detain Him or to follow Him. Their hearts would be full of strangely mingled feelings, and they were being taught by gentle degrees to do without Him. Not only a divine decorum, but a most gracious tenderness, dictated the alternation of presence and absence during these days.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The instructions then given are again referred to in Luke’s Gospel, and are there represented as principally directed to opening their minds ‘that they might understand the Scriptures.’ The main thing about the kingdom which they had then to learn, was that it was founded on the death of Christ, who had fulfilled all the Old Testament predictions. Much remained untaught, which after years were to bring to clear knowledge; but from the illumination shed during these fruitful days flowed the remarkable vigour and confidence of the Apostolic appeal to the prophets, in the first conflicts of the Church with the rulers. Christ is the King of the kingdom, and His Cross is His throne,-these truths being grasped revolutionised the Apostles’ conceptions. They are as needful for us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> From <a href="/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a> onwards the last interview seems to be narrated. Probably it began in the city, and ended on the slopes of Olivet. There was a solemn summoning together of the Eleven, which is twice referred to {<a href="/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a>, <a href="/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>}. What awe of expectancy would rest on the group as they gathered round Him, perhaps half suspecting that it was for the last time! His words would change the suspicion into certainty, for He proceeded to tell them what they were not to do and to do, when left alone. The tone of leave-taking is unmistakable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The prohibition against leaving Jerusalem implies that they would have done so if left to themselves; and it would have been small wonder if they had been eager to hurry back to quiet Galilee, their home, and to shake from their feet the dust of the city where their Lord had been slain. Truly they would feel like sheep in the midst of wolves when He had gone, and Pharisees and priests and Roman officers ringed them round. No wonder if, like a shepherdless flock, they had broken and scattered! But the theocratic importance of Jerusalem, and the fact that nowhere else could the Apostles secure such an audience for their witness, made their ‘beginning at Jerusalem’ necessary. So they were to crush their natural longing to get back to Galilee, and to stay in their dangerous position. We have all to ask, not where we should be most at ease, but where we shall be most efficient as witnesses for Christ, and to remember that very often the presence of adversaries makes the door ‘great and effectual.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These eleven poor men were not left by their Master with a hard task and no help. He bade them ‘wait’ for the promised Holy Spirit, the coming of whom they had heard from Him when in the upper room He spoke to them of ‘the Comforter.’ They were too feeble to act alone, and silence and retirement were all that He enjoined till they had been plunged into the fiery baptism which should quicken, strengthen, and transform them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The order in which promise and command occur here shows how graciously Jesus considered the Apostles’ weakness. Not a word does He say of their task of witnessing, till He has filled their hearts with the promise of the Spirit. He shows them the armour of power in which they are to be clothed, before He points them to the battlefield. Waiting times are not wasted times. Over-eagerness to rush into work, especially into conspicuous and perilous work, is sure to end in defeat. Till we feel the power coming into us, we had better be still.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The promise of this great gift, the nature of which they but dimly knew, set the Apostles’ expectations on tiptoe, and they seem to have thought that their reception of it was in some way the herald of the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. So it was, but in a very different fashion from their dream. They had not learned so much from the forty days’ instructions concerning the kingdom as to be free from their old Jewish notions, which colour their question, ‘Wilt Thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?’ They believed that Jesus could establish His kingdom when He would. They were right, and also wrong,-right, for He is King; wrong, for its establishment is not to be effected by a single act of power, but by the slow process of preaching the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Our Lord does not deal with their misconceptions which could only be cured by time and events; but He lays down great principles, which we need as much as the Eleven did. The ‘times and seasons,’ the long stretches of days, and the critical epoch-making moments, are known to God only; our business is, not to speculate curiously about these, but to do the plain duty which is incumbent on the Church at all times. The perpetual office of Christ’s people to be His witnesses, their equipment for that function {namely, the power of the Holy Spirit coming on them}, and the sphere of their work {namely, in ever-widening circles, Jerusalem, Samaria, and the whole world}, are laid down, not for the first hearers only, but for all ages and for each individual, in these last words of the Lord as He stood on Olivet, ready to depart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The calm simplicity of the account of the Ascension is remarkable. So great an event told in such few, unimpassioned words! Luke’s Gospel gives the further detail that it was in the act of blessing with uplifted hands that our Lord was parted from the Eleven. Two expressions are here used to describe the Ascension, one of which {‘was taken up’} implies that He was passive, the other of which {‘He went’} implies that He was active. Both are true. As in the accounts of the Resurrection He is sometimes said to have been raised, and sometimes to have risen, so here. The Father took the Son back to the glory, the Son left the world and went to the Father. No chariot of fire, no whirlwind, was needed to lift Him to the throne. Elijah was carried by such agency into a sphere new to him; Jesus ascended up where He was before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No other mode of departure from earth would have corresponded to His voluntary, supernatural birth. He carried manhood up to the throne of God. The cloud which received Him while yet He was well within sight of the gazers was probably that same bright cloud, the symbol of the Divine Presence, which of old dwelt between the cherubim. His entrance into it visibly symbolised the permanent participation, then begun, of His glorified manhood in the divine glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Most true to human nature is that continued gaze upwards after He had passed into the hiding brightness of the glory-cloud. How many of us know what it is to look long at the spot on the horizon where the last glint of sunshine struck the sails of the ship that bore dear ones away from us! It was fitting that angels, who had heralded His birth and watched His grave, should proclaim His Second Coming to earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It was gracious that, in the moment of keenest sense of desolation and loss, the great hope of reunion should be poured into the hearts of the Apostles. Nothing can be more distinct and assured than the terms of that angel message. It gives for the faith and hope of all ages the assurance that He will come; that He who comes will be the very Jesus who went; that His coming will be, like His departure, visible, corporeal, local. He will bring again all His tenderness, all His brother’s heart, all His divine power, and will gather His servants to Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No wonder that, with such hopes flowing over the top of their sorrow, like oil on troubled waters, the little group went back to the upper room, hallowed by memories of the Last Supper, and there waited in prayer and supplication during the ten days which elapsed till Pentecost. So should we use the interval between any promise and its fulfilment. Patient expectation, believing prayer, harmonious association with our brethren, will prepare us for receiving the gift of the Spirit, and will help to equip us as witnesses for Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then returned they unto Jerusalem — </span>According to their Master’s appointment, having first worshipped him, <a href="/luke/24-52.htm" title="And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:">Luke 24:52</a>. Here they were in the midst of enemies; but it seems, though immediately after Christ’s resurrection they were watched, and were in fear of the Jews, yet after it was known that they were gone into Galilee, no notice was taken of their return to the city, nor any further search made for them. In Jerusalem they employed themselves in a daily course of public and private devotion, rejoicing in what they had seen and heard, and firmly believing some extraordinary event was at hand, whereby they should be more fully qualified for the great work assigned them; which, whatever the hazard of it might be, they were firmly determined to undertake and prosecute.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-14 God can find hiding-places for his people. They made supplication. All God's people are praying people. It was now a time of trouble and danger with the disciples of Christ; but if any is afflicted, let him pray; that will silence cares and fears. They had now a great work to do, and before they entered upon it, they were earnest in prayer to God for his presence. They were waiting for the descent of the Spirit, and abounded in prayer. Those are in the best frame to receive spiritual blessings, who are in a praying frame. Christ had promised shortly to send the Holy Ghost; that promise was not to do away prayer, but to quicken and encourage it. A little company united in love, exemplary in their conduct, fervent in prayer, and wisely zealous to promote the cause of Christ, are likely to increase rapidly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then returned they unto Jerusalem - In <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a>, we are told that they worshipped Jesus before they returned, and it is probable that the act of worship to which he refers was what is mentioned in this chapter their gazing intently on their departing Lord.<p>From the mount called Olivet - From the Mount of Olives.

The distance of a lawful journey on the Sabbath was not fixed by the laws of Moses, but the Jewish teachers had fixed it at 2,000 paces. This measure was determined on because it was a tradition that in the camp of the Israelites, when coming from Egypt, no part of the camp was more than 2000 paces from the tabernacle, and over this space, therefore, they were permitted to travel for worship. Perhaps, also, some countenance was given to this from the fact that this was the extent of the suburbs of the Levitical cities, <a href="/numbers/35-5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>. Mount Olivet was only 5 furlongs from Jerusalem, and Bethany was 15 furlongs. But on the eastern declivity of the mountain the tract of country was called, for a considerable space, the region of Bethany; and it was from this place that the Lord Jesus ascended. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ac 1:12-26.

With great joy, after the angels had told them that he should come again in like manner: <p>from the mount called Olivet; which was on the east side of Jerusalem, a mountain Christ much frequented, and from whence he ascended to heaven. This is the hill which in <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a> is said to be "before Jerusalem"; and accordingly Jarchi interprets it of the Mount of Olives; and in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> it is expressly said to be "before Jerusalem on the east"; hence, when our Lord sat upon it, he is said to be over against the temple, <a href="/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>. It has its name from the multitude of olive trees which grew upon it: it is by the Jewish writers sometimes called , "the Mount of Olives" (n), as in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a> and sometimes  (o), and  (p), "the Mount of Oil"; i.e. of olive oil, which was made out of the olives that grew upon it. It is said, that in an old edition of the Latin version of this text it is called "the Mountain of Three Lights"; and this reason is given for it, because on the west side it was enlightened in the night by the continual fire of the altar in the temple; and on the east side it had the first beams of the sun before the city was enlightened with them; and it produced plenty of olives, by which the light is maintained in the lamps. Josephus (q) relates, that in the earthquake in the times of Uzziah, half part of this mountain, which was to the west, was divided from it, and was rolled four furlongs to the eastern part of it, so that the ways and king's gardens were stopped up, <p>Which, is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. The Syriac version renders it, "about seven furlongs", or near a mile; though Josephus (r) writes, that the Mount of Olives was but five furlongs from Jerusalem: perhaps this may be a mistake in the present copies of Josephus, since Chrysostom on this place cites this passage of Josephus, and reads seven furlongs; which exactly agrees with the Syriac version. A sabbath day's journey, according to the Jews, was two thousand cubits from any city or town, and which they often called, , "the bound of the sabbath" (s); and which they collect partly from <a href="/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4</a> which they understand thus (t): <p>"a thousand cubits are the suburbs (of the city), and two thousand cubits the bounds of the sabbath. <p>And these were so many middling paces; for so they say (u), <p>"a walk of two thousand middling paces, this is the bound of the sabbath. <p>And that this was the proper space they also gather from <a href="/joshua/3-4.htm">Joshua 3:4</a> it being the distance between the ark and the people when they marched; and though this was not fixed by the law, yet being a tradition of the elders, was strictly observed by them: so when Ruth desired to become a proselytess, the Targumist on <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a> introduces Naomi thus speaking to her, <p>"says Naomi, we are commanded to keep the sabbaths, and the good days, (or feasts,) and not to walk above "two thousand cubits"; <p>i.e. on those days; for to go further was reckoned a profanation of them: so it is said (w), <p>"the sabbath day is profaned with the hands by work, and with the feet by walking more than "two thousand cubits". <p>Yea, this was punishable with beatings (x): <p>"a man might go on the sabbath without the city two thousand cubits on every side--but if he went beyond two thousand cubits, they beat him with the beating of rebels, <p>or in the same manner a rebellious son was beaten. Nay, not only they might not go out of a city or town where they were, further than this, but from whatsoever place they happened to be, as appears by these following rules (y), <p>"if anyone falls asleep in the way (or on the road), and he does not know that it was dark (and so that the sabbath is begun), he has two thousand cubits (allowed him) on every side.--Whoever is on a journey, and it is dark, and he knows a tree, or a hedge, and says, let my sabbath (or sabbatical seat) be under it, he says nothing; but if he says, let my sabbath be at the root of it, then he may go from the place of his feet, and to the root of it, two thousand cubits, and from the root of it to his house two thousand cubits; by which means he may go four thousand cubits after it is dark. But if he does not know (any), and is not expert in walking, and says, let my sabbath be in my place, (i.e. in which he stands,) then from his place he has two thousand cubits on every side. <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> day's journey.</span><p>(h) About two miles.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a>.

It is not the distance of the <span class="ital">place</span> of the ascension, but of the <span class="ital">Mount of Olives</span>, on which it occurred, that is meant.

(neither is the formula found in <a href="/john/8-1.htm" title="Jesus went to the mount of Olives.">John 8:1</a>). It is therefore probable that St. Luke speaks as he does as one who was a stranger to Jerusalem, or, as writing to one who was so. Blass, <span class="ital">ubi supra</span>, pp. 32, 84, contends that <span class="greekheb">Ἐλαιῶνος</span> ought to give place to <span class="greekheb">ἐλαιῶν</span>, which he also reads in <a href="/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a>; <a href="/luke/21-37.htm" title="And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.">Luke 21:37</a> (W.H[102] <span class="greekheb">Ἐλαιῶν</span>, and in <a href="/luke/19-37.htm" title="And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;">Luke 19:37</a>; <a href="/luke/22-39.htm" title="And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.">Luke 22:39</a>, <span class="greekheb">τῶν Ἐλαιῶν</span>, in each case as genitive of <span class="greekheb">ἐλαία</span>), the former word being found only here and in Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, vii., 9, 2. But it is found in all the MSS. in this passage, although <span class="ital">falso . cum cæt.</span>, says Blass. Blass would thus get rid of the difficulty of regarding <span class="greekheb">Ἐλαιών</span> as if used in <a href="/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a>; <a href="/luke/21-37.htm" title="And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.">Luke 21:37</a> as an indeclinable noun, whilst here he would exchange its genitive for <span class="greekheb">ἐλαιῶν</span>. Deisstmann, however, is not inclined to set aside the consensus of authoritities for <span class="greekheb">Ἐλαιῶνος</span>, and he regards <span class="greekheb">ἐλαιών</span> in the two passages above as a lax use of the nominative case. As the genitive of <span class="greekheb">ἐλαιών</span> it would correspond to the Latin <span class="ital">Olivetum</span> (so Vulgate), an olive-orchard; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἄμπελος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀμπελών</span> in N.T., the termination <span class="greekheb">ών</span> in derivative nouns indicating a place set with trees of the kind designated by the primitive. for instances <span class="ital">cf.</span> Grimm-Thayer, <span class="ital">sub</span> <span class="greekheb">Ἐλαιών</span>, but see on the other hand Deissmann, <span class="ital">Neue Bibelstudien</span>, p. 36 ff. With regard to the parallel between our verse and Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, vii., 9, 2, it is evident that even if St. Luke had read Josephus he was not dependent upon him, for he says here <span class="greekheb">τοῦ καλ</span>. just as in his Gospel he had written <span class="greekheb">τὸ καλ</span>., probably giving one or more popular names by which the place was known; Gloël, <span class="ital">Galaterbrief</span>, p. 65 (see also on the word W.H[103], ii., Appendix, p. 165; Plummer, <span class="ital">St. Luke</span>, p. 445; and Winer-Schmiedel, p. 93).—<span class="greekheb">σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχον</span>: the distance is represented as something which the mountain has, Meyer-Wendt; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/24-13.htm" title="And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.">Luke 24:13</a>.

Nor is it likely that our Lord would lead His disciples into a village for the event of His Ascension. It should be remembered that Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Hor. Heb.</span>, says that “the Ascension was from the place where that tract of the Mount of Olives ceased to be called Bethphage and began to be called Bethany”. The recent attempt of Rud. Hoffmann to refer the Ascension to a “Galilee” in the Mount of Olives rests upon a tradition which cannot be regarded as reliable (see <span class="ital">Galilæa auf dem Oelberg</span>, Leipzig, 1896), although he can quote Resch as in agreement with him, p. 14. On Hoffmann’s pamphlet see also <span class="ital">Expositor</span> (5th series), p. 119 (1897), and <span class="ital">Theologisches Literaturblatt</span>, No. 27 (1897).

Jehudah ha-Nasi’s lectures and so not embodied in the Mishna proper, but incorporated amongst the Gemara or in other ways] on <a href="/exodus/16-29.htm" title="See, for that the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.">Exodus 16:29</a>, ‘Abide ye every man <span class="ital">in his place</span>’ (<span class="ital">takhtav</span>), that means the four yards (which is the space allowed for downsitting and uprising), and in the same verse it says ‘Let no man go out of <span class="ital">his place</span> (<span class="ital">makom</span>), this is the two thousand yards.’ ” The argument intended to be founded on this explanation is, that as Holy Writ, which does not uselessly multiply words, has used here two different words for <span class="ital">place</span>, this is done because there is a different meaning for each. “But (continues the questioner) how do you learn this?” (viz. that <span class="ital">makom</span> implies two thousand yards). Rab Chisda says “We have learnt the meaning of <span class="ital">makom</span> from the use of <span class="ital">makom</span> elsewhere, and we learn what that [second] <span class="ital">makom</span> means from <span class="ital">nisah</span> (= flight, with which word, in one passage, it is connected), and what <span class="ital">nisah</span> means we have learnt from another <span class="ital">nisah</span>, and the meaning of the [second] <span class="ital">nisah</span> we gather from <span class="ital">gebul</span> (= border, which is found in connection with it in a certain passage), and what <span class="ital">gebul</span> means we gather from another <span class="ital">gebul</span>, and what that <span class="ital">gebul</span> means from <span class="ital">khuts</span> (= extremity), and what <span class="ital">khuts</span> means from another <span class="ital">khuts;</span> for it is written (<a href="/numbers/35-5.htm" title="And you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the middle: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.">Numbers 35:5</a>) ‘and ye shall measure from the extremity (<span class="ital">mikhuts</span>) of the city, on the east side, two thousand yards.’ ”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So taking <span class="ital">khuts</span> in this last passage as defined, they, by an equation <span class="ital">khuts = gebul = nisah = makom</span>, defined the second word <span class="ital">place</span> mentioned in <a href="/exodus/16-29.htm" title="See, for that the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.">Exodus 16:29</a>, as also equal to two thousand yards.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Scriptural passages on which the above reasoning is based are (1) <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm" title="And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.">Exodus 21:13</a>, “I will appoint thee a <span class="ital">place</span> (<span class="ital">makom</span>) whither <span class="ital">he shall flee</span>” (<span class="ital">yanus</span>), and from the verb <span class="ital">yanus</span> the noun <span class="ital">nisah</span> is formed; (2) <a href="/numbers/35-26.htm" title="But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, where he was fled;">Numbers 35:26</a>, “But if the slayer shall at any time come without the <span class="ital">border</span> (<span class="ital">gebul</span>) of the city of his refuge whither <span class="ital">he is fled</span>,” which passage connects <span class="ital">gebul</span> and <span class="ital">nisah</span>; and (3) <a href="/numbers/35-27.htm" title="And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:">Numbers 35:27</a>, “If the avenger of blood find him <span class="ital">without</span> (<span class="ital">mikhuts</span>) the <span class="ital">border</span> of the city of his refuge,” which brings <span class="ital">khuts</span> into connection with <span class="ital">gebul</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A traditional development of an interpretation like this must have been received, by him who announces it, from his teacher and must not be his own invention, and in this way a very high antiquity is assured for all such interpretations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐλαιῶνος</span>, <span class="ital">of Olives</span>) where His agony had taken place.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγγὺς</span>, <span class="ital">near to</span>) five furlongs.—<span class="greekheb">Σαββάτου ὁδὸν</span>, <span class="ital">a Sabbath day’s journey</span>) As far as a Jew was permitted to journey on the Sabbath day, without fatigue; <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as much as two thousand cubits (ells).
