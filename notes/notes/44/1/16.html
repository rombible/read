To do that work faithfully was a worthier fruit of repentance than any public confession of his guilt would have been.

It is certain the sixty-ninth Psalm is not to be confined to Judas; for Paul (<a href="/context/romans/11-9.htm" title="And David said, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them:...">Romans 11:9-10</a>) has quoted the 22d and 23d verses of it as applicable to the unbelieving Jews in general: and “there are so many passages in both these psalms more applicable to David than to Christ, that I was very inclinable,” says Dr. Doddridge, “to render the words before us thus: <span class="ital">The scripture which the Holy Ghost spake before, by the mouth of David, must necessarily have been fulfilled concerning Judas, </span>&c.; and to have explained them as if the apostle had said, ‘That vengeance which David foretold, as to be executed on his enemies, must much more fall on Judas, whose perfidious and cruel attack on Christ himself rendered him so much more criminal.’ But it is certain, the order of the Greek words will not naturally admit this interpretation. I therefore conclude that, while David prophesied of the calamities which should befall his persecutors, it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that the enemies and murderers of the Messiah should inherit those curses in all their terror, and be yet more miserable than the persons on whom they were more immediately to fall. This fact I take to be asserted in these words, as what was revealed by the same Spirit to the Apostle Peter:” an interpretation “which may serve as a key to many other passages of the New Testament.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-26 The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ's resurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will.

The passage to which Peter refers is commonly supposed to be that recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, "Yea, mine own familiar friend ...hath lifted up his heel against me." This is expressly applied to Judas by our Saviour, in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>.

Which is said not so much by Peter to express his modesty, and humility, and his brotherly love; or on account of the spiritual relation that subsisted between him and the persons he speaks to, as it was a common form used in addresses; see <a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a> it should seem, that the women, were not reckoned into the number of the hundred and twenty here addressed; and the Syriac version calls that number, "the number of men", unless they are supposed to be included in them: <p>this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled; or "must needs be fulfilled": referring either to <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> or rather to the passages after cited out of <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>. There was a necessity of the fulfilling of it, consistent with the prescience of God, his counsel, and decree, and the veracity of the Scripture; which necessity does not at all excuse the sin of Judas, who acted freely from the wickedness of his own heart, and not from any force that this laid upon him: and the apostle might observe this also, to make the minds of the disciples easy, under this awful providence, since it was no other than what was predicted: and <p>which the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of David, spake before; even many hundreds of years before the event; and which shows the omniscience, and so the deity of the Holy Ghost, and the divine authority of David's Psalms; as well as the honour that was put upon him to be the instrument by which the Holy Ghost speaks, and to be his amanuensis: the particular referred to, is, "concerning" Judas; who is sometimes called Iscariot, to distinguish him from another apostle of the same name; and what is hereafter said sufficiently does that; or <p>concerning that Judas, as the Syriac version renders it: <p>which was a guide to them that took Jesus; to the band of soldiers and officers, who came with swords and staves, as to take a thief, or a robber; before these Judas went and showed them, not only the place where he was, but gave them a sign by which they should know him, and also advice to take him and hold him fast, and lead him away safely; so that he was not only a guide as to the way, but was a director, and conductor, and manager of the whole affair. And it may be observed, that though Peter did not conceal, but declares the sin of Judas; yet not in a rough manner, aggravating it, but with much softness and tenderness; though with no design to lessen it, as appears by what follows, and which may be instructive to us in speaking of other men's sins. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Men <i>and</i> brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</span><p>(7) Peter anticipates the offence that might be taken at the falling away of Judas the betrayer, showing that all things which happened to him were foretold by God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus....">Acts 1:16-17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄνδρες ἀδελφοί</span> is more honourable and solemn than the simple familiar <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>.

It expresses a divine necessity, and is used by all the Evangelists, as by St. Peter here, and by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>), of the events connected with and following upon the Passion.—<span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">oportet</span>, expresses logical necessity rather than personal moral obligation <span class="greekheb">ὤφειλεν</span>, <span class="ital">debuit</span>, or the sense of fitness, <span class="greekheb">ἔπρεπεν</span>, <span class="ital">decebat</span>. The three words are all found in <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm" title="Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.">Hebrews 2:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>, on which see Westcott, <span class="ital">Hebrews</span>, p. 36, and Plummer’s <span class="ital">St. Luke</span>, p. 247.

St. Luke uses this, or a similar expression, <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span> or <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἅγιον πνεῦμα</span>, about forty times in Acts alone, whilst in St. Luke’s Gospel alone it is used about as many times as in the three other Evangelists together (Lekebusch, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 65, and Plummer, <span class="ital">St. Luke</span>, p. 14).—<span class="greekheb">ὁδηγοῦ τοῖς συλλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸν Ἰησοῦν</span>. St. Peter simply states a fact, but does not heap scorn or abuse upon Judas (Chrysostom, <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, iii., <span class="ital">cf.</span> Theophylact). St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. John simply say of Judas <span class="greekheb">ὁ παραδιδούς</span>, “he who delivered Him up,” or employ some similar expression; he is never called “<span class="ital">the</span> traitor” (St. <a href="/luke/6-16.htm" title="And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.">Luke 6:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο προδότης</span>, “<span class="ital">became a</span> traitor,” see Plummer, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). This self-restraint is remarkable on the part of men who must have regarded their Master’s Death as the most atrocious of murders (see Row, <span class="ital">Bampton Lectures</span>, pp. 179, 180, note). At the same time the word <span class="greekheb">ὁδηγός</span> seems to bring before us the scene in Gethsemane, how Judas went before the multitude, and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him (<a href="/luke/22-47.htm" title="And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.">Luke 22:47</a>), and to show us how vividly the memories of the Passion were present to St. Peter; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1 Peter 2:21</a> ff.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Men and brethren</span>] The original is meant for one epithet, and would be fully enough rendered by <span class="bld">brethren</span> alone, here and in other places where it occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">this scripture</span>, &c.] “<span class="ital">This</span>” is omitted by the best authorities.

It is to be noticed that Peter can thus speak because he had now been taught to understand the Scriptures (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm" title="Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,">Luke 24:45</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">must needs have been fulfilled</span>] Christ was to die on the cross, betrayed to death by one in whom He had trusted. David had spoken in the Psalms of his own afflictions from a similar treachery and also of the destruction which he invoked upon those who were guilty of such infidelity. But while David spake of himself and of his own circumstances, the Holy Ghost through him was speaking of the betrayal of the “Son of David,” and the words which had been true of David, must have their still more complete fulfilment in the betrayal of the Saviour, by him “who was guide to them that took Jesus” (<a href="/matthew/26-47.htm" title="And while he yet spoke, see, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.">Matthew 26:47</a>, &c.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄνδρες ἀδελφοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">men brethren</span>) This is a more blessed mode of address than the well-known one of Demosthenes, etc., <span class="ital">Men of Athens</span>.

(<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25-27, 44-46</a>). It is most important to our Christian integrity that we should view the Scriptures in the same light as our Lord and his apostles did, as containing real prophecies, spoken by the Holy Ghost. (Compare the manner in which the sixty-ninth psalm is here quoted with that of <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7</a>.) So the Creed, "I believe in the Holy Ghost .... who spake by the prophets" (comp. <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>; <a href="/acts/28-25.htm">Acts 28:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who was guide</span>, etc. If St. Peter had only been addressing his brother apostles, who were well acquainted with the treachery of Judas, it would scarcely have been natural to introduce these words; they would have seemed rather to be explanatory words added by the historian. But the circumstances might be very imperfectly known to many of the hundred and twenty brethren assembled on this occasion; and if so, the reference to Judas's treachery would not be out of place in St. Peter's mouth. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Men and brethren (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>Lit., men, brothers.
