It is called in the Alexandrian copy "Acheldamach"; and often by Jerom (p) "Acheldemach", but very wrongly; for not "Demach", but "Dema", in the Syriac and Chaldee dialect, signifies "blood"; which Peter calls the dialect of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, being now spoken by them, in distinction from the Galilean dialect used by him; which, it is plain, was different from the Jerusalem dialect by what is said, <a href="/mark/14-70.htm">Mark 14:70</a>.

The passage in Matthew, <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, gives another and more probable reason for the name.

But many critics, who refuse to see in the whole of the two verses any parenthetical remarks of the historian, adopt the view that <span class="greekheb">τῇ διαλέκτῳ αὐτῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">τοῦτʼ ἔστιν χωρίον αἵματος</span> are explanations introduced by St. Luke, who could trust to his Gentile readers to distinguish between his words and those of St. Peter (Wendt, Holtzmann, Zöckler, Nösgen, Jüngst. Matthias).—<span class="greekheb">τῇ διαλέκτῳ</span>: only in Acts in the N.T., where it is used six times in all parts; it may mean dialect or language, but here it is used in the latter sense (R.V.) to distinguish Aramaic from Greek (<span class="ital">cf.</span> its use in Polybius).—<span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the dwellers of Jerusalem, who spoke Aramaic—unless the whole expression is used rhetorically, it would seem that it contains the words, not of St. Peter, who himself spoke Aramaic, but of the author (see Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>).—<span class="greekheb">Ἀκελδαμά</span>: the Aramaic of the Field of Blood would be <span class="greekheb">חֲקַל דְּמָא</span>, and it is possible that the <span class="greekheb">χ</span> may be added to represent in some way the guttural [108], just as <span class="greekheb">Σιράχ</span> = <span class="greekheb">סירא</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and <span class="ital">Grammatik des N.

W.H[109] (so Blass) read <span class="greekheb">Ἁκελδαμάχ</span> (and <span class="greekheb">Ἀχελδαμάχ</span>, Tisch. and Treg.); see also on the word Winer-Schmiedel, pp. 60 and 63.

But why should there not be two reasons? If the traitor in the agony of his remorse rushed from the Temple into the valley of Hinnom, and across the valley to “the potter’s field” of Jeremiah, the old name of the potter’s field might easily become changed in the popular language into that of “field of blood,” whilst the reason given by St. Matthew for the name might still hold good, since the blood-money, which by a fiction of law was still considered to belong to Judas, was employed for the purchase of the accursed spot as a burial ground for strangers. See Edersheim, <span class="ital">Jesus the Messiah</span>, ii., 574, 575. Whatever may be alleged as to the growth of popular fancy and tradition in the later account in Acts of the death of Judas, it cannot be said to contrast unfavourably with the details given by Papias, <span class="ital">Fragment</span>, 18, which Blass describes as “insulsissima et fœdissima”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">And it was known</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">became</span> <span class="ital">known</span>.

The addition of these words and the explanation of the name <span class="ital">Akeldama</span> point to this passage as an insertion made by St Luke for the information of Theophilus, who, as his name indicates, was probably of Greek origin, and, it may be, unacquainted with the vernacular speech of Palestine. There could have been no need for St Peter to make such an explanation to the one hundred and twenty who listened to his address. Nor, indeed, is it probable that the name “Field of Blood” became of such common use within the time between the Crucifixion and the election of Matthias, as to make it possible for St Peter to have used the words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For a similar insertion of a significant name introduced into a compiled narrative before the time at which the name was actually given, cp. <a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm" title="And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.
