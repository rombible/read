The room may have been the same as that in which the Paschal Supper had been eaten (<a href="/mark/14-15.htm" title="And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.">Mark 14:15</a>). On the other hand, that room seems to have been different from that in which the disciples had lodged during the Paschal week, and to have been chosen specially for the occasion (<a href="/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>). The word used is also different in form. So far as we are able to distinguish between the two words, the room of the Paschal Supper was on the first floor, the guest-chamber, used for meals; that in which the disciples now met, on the second floor, or loft, which was used for retirement and prayer. It would seem from <a href="/luke/24-53.htm" title="And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.">Luke 24:53</a>, that they spent the greater part of each day in the Temple, and met together in the evening. The better MSS. give “prayer” only, without “supplication.” The prayer thus offered may be thought of as specially directed to the “promise of the Father.” Whether it was spoken or silent, unpremeditated or in some set form of words, like the Lord’s Prayer, we have no <span class= "ital">data</span> to determine.<p><span class= "bld">Peter, and James.</span>—On the lists of the Twelve Apostles see Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2-4</a>.

The upper rooms, so frequently mentioned in Scripture, were chambers in the highest part of the houses, set apart by the Jews for private prayer.

They made supplication. All God's people are praying people. It was now a time of trouble and danger with the disciples of Christ; but if any is afflicted, let him pray; that will silence cares and fears. They had now a great work to do, and before they entered upon it, they were earnest in prayer to God for his presence. They were waiting for the descent of the Spirit, and abounded in prayer. Those are in the best frame to receive spiritual blessings, who are in a praying frame. Christ had promised shortly to send the Holy Ghost; that promise was not to do away prayer, but to quicken and encourage it. A little company united in love, exemplary in their conduct, fervent in prayer, and wisely zealous to promote the cause of Christ, are likely to increase rapidly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were come in - To Jerusalem.<p>They went up into an upper room - The word &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  huperoo&#772;n, here translated "upper room," occurs only four times in the New Testament: <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-37.htm">Acts 9:37</a>, "She (Dorcas) was sick and died; whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber" (see also <a href="/acts/9-39.htm">Acts 9:39</a>); <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/20-8.htm">Acts 20:8</a>, "And there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together." The room so designated was an upper chamber used for devotion, or as a place where to lay the dead before burial, or occasionally for conversation, etc. Here it evidently means the place where they were assembled for devotion. <a href="/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a> says they were continually "in the temple" praising and blessing God; and some have supposed that the upper room here designated was one of the rooms in the temple. But there is no evidence of that, and it is not very probable. Such a room as that here referred to was a part of every house, especially in Jerusalem; and the disciples probably selected one where they might be together, and yet so retired that they might be safe from the Jews. The expression used in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>, "They were continually - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  diapantos - in the temple," signifies no more than that this was a frequent or customary resort; they were always in the temple at the usual seasons of devotion, or they were in the constant habit of resorting thither.

Some think it was the house of John the Evangelist, whither he had taken Mary the mother of our Lord, <a href="/john/19-27.htm">John 19:27</a> which is not improbable: others, that it was the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where the disciples met for prayer when Peter was put into prison, <a href="/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a> others, that it was the house of Simon the leper; but his house was not at Jerusalem, but in Bethany, <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>. Some have thought it was the house of Nicodemus, or of Joseph of Arimathea; but after all it seems most likely, that it was not any private house, but the temple into which the disciples immediately went, and where they continued; see <a href="/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a> and <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>. <p>they went up into an upper room; which, if in a private house, they might choose for retirement and secrecy; and might be the same in which they had eaten the passover; and so a Syriac scholiast, in manuscript, on the place, says it was the same. It was usual to meet in upper rooms for devotion and religious conversation;  see Gill on <a href="/mark/2-4.htm">Mark 2:4</a> though this upper room might be one of the chambers in the temple; for not only from the scriptural account of the temple, there were chambers round about it, and upper chambers; see <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a> and one of these is called the chamber of Gemariah, in which Baruch read the prophecies of Jeremiah, <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a> but also from the Jewish writings, in which frequent mention is made of the chamber Palhedrin, where the high priest was brought seven days before the day of atonement (c); and the chamber of the counsellors (d); and the chamber Gazith, where the sanhedrim sat; and the chamber of the house of Abtines (e); and the chamber of wood; and the chamber of the lepers; and the chamber of the house of oil (f); and the chamber of salt; and the chamber of Parvah; and the chamber of them that wash, besides others (g). And into a chamber, or upper room in the temple they might be let by Joses Barnabas, a Levite, one of their own company, <a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a> who might have the care of it, for they are said to be continually in the temple, <a href="/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>. <p>Where abode both Peter, and James, and John. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, "Peter, and John, and James"; and so the Alexandrian copy. These were the three favourite disciples of Christ, and are often mentioned together, as here first, <p>and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions put Matthew before Bartholomew, <p>James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas, the brother of James; all the Oriental versions read, "Judas the son of James": of the names of the apostles; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-2.htm">Matthew 10:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>.

Both words are found in classical Greek, but only the latter in the LXX, where it is frequent. In the N.T. it is used by St. Luke alone, and only in Acts. Holtzmann, following Lightfoot and Schöttgen, considers that an upper room in the Temple is meant, but this would be scarcely probable under the circumstances, and a meeting in a private house, <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>, <a href="/acts/4-23.htm" title="And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.">Acts 4:23</a>, <a href="/acts/5-42.htm" title="And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.">Acts 5:42</a>, is far more likely.—<span class="greekheb">ὅ τε Π</span>.: in a series of nouns embraced under one category only the first may have the article, Winer-Schmiedel, pp. 154–157. In comparing this list of the Apostles with that given by the Synoptists we notice that whilst St. Peter stands at the head in the four lists, those three are placed in the first group who out of the whole band are prominent in the Acts as also in the Gospels, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, Peter, John, and James; all the Synoptists, however, place St. James as the elder brother before St. John. In St. Luke’s first list, as in St. Matthew’s list, the brothers Peter and Andrew stand first, followed by another pair of brothers James and John; but in Acts Andrew gives place, as we might expect, to the three Apostles who had been admitted to the closest intimacy with Jesus during His earthly life, and St. John as St. Peter’s constant companion in the Gospel narrative makes a pair with him. The list in Acts agrees with that given by St. Luke in his Gospel in two particulars (see Friedrich, <span class="ital">ubi supra</span>, p. 50, and so too Zeller): (1) Simon the Zealot is called not <span class="greekheb">ὁ Καναναῖος</span>, as in Matthew and Mark, but <span class="greekheb">ὁ Ζηλωτής</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/6-15.htm" title="Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,">Luke 6:15</a>; (2) instead of Thaddæus (or Lebbæus) we have “Judas of James,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/6-16.htm" title="And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.">Luke 6:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου</span>, “the <span class="ital">son</span> of James,” R.V. (so too above <span class="greekheb">Ἰάκωβος Ἀλφαίου</span>, “James the <span class="ital">son</span> of Alphæus”), placing the words “or, brother, see <a href="/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1</a>,” in the margin, so too in <a href="/luke/6-16.htm" title="And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.">Luke 6:16</a>. The rendering of the words as Jude the <span class="ital">brother</span> of James was probably caused by <a href="/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1</a>, and it is difficult to believe, as Nösgen argues (see also Winer-Schmiedel, p. 262), that in the same list and in such close proximity these two meanings “the son of” and “the brother of” should occur for the genitive, although no doubt it is possible grammatically; see Nösgen and Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>. On the other hand, see Felten, note, p. 66. But Winer, to whom the latter refers, is by no means positive, and only expresses the opinion that <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφός</span> is perhaps to be supplied here and in <a href="/luke/6-16.htm" title="And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.">Luke 6:16</a> if the same Apostle is referred to in <a href="/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1</a>. (Winer-Moulton, p. 238). But the identification with the latter is very improbable, as he was most likely the brother of James, known as “the Lord’s brother” (see Plummer on <span class="ital">Luke</span>, <a href="/luke/6-16.htm" title="And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.">Luke 6:16</a>, and Salmon, <span class="ital">Introduction to N. T.</span>, pp. 473, 474, fifth edit.). It is also noteworthy that St. Luke uses <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφός</span> where he means “brother,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>; <a href="/luke/6-14.htm" title="Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,">Luke 6:14</a>; <a href="/acts/12-2.htm" title="And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.">Acts 12:2</a>. Blass, <span class="ital">Grammatik des N.

The list, it has been thought, is given here again by St. Luke to show the recovery of the Apostolic band from their denial and flight—so St. Chrysostom remarks that Luke did well to mention the disciples, for since one had betrayed Christ and another had been unbelieving, he hereby shows that, except the first, all were preserved (so to the same effect Œcumenius, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). There may also have been the desire of the author to intimate that although only the works of a few on the list would be chronicled, yet all alike were witnesses to Christ and workers for Him (Lumby).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">And when they were come in</span>] i.e. into the city, from the open country where the Ascension had taken place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they went up into an</span> [<span class="bld">the</span>] <span class="ital">upper room</span>] Probably the upper room which has been mentioned before (<a href="/mark/14-15.htm" title="And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.">Mark 14:15</a>; <a href="/luke/22-12.htm" title="And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.">Luke 22:12</a>) as used by our Lord and His disciples for the passover feast. The Greek word in the Gospels is not the same as here, but in both cases it is evident that it was some room which could be spared by the occupiers and which was let or lent to the Galilæan band and their followers. The next words indicate die temporary occupancy, and would be better rendered <span class="ital">where they were abiding, namely Peter</span>, &c. The eleven were the tenants of the upper room, to which the other disciples resorted for conference and communion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Peter</span>, &c.] The names of the Apostles are again given, though they had been recorded for Theophilus in “the former treatise” (<a href="/context/luke/6-14.htm" title="Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,...">Luke 6:14-16</a>), perhaps because it seemed fitting that the names of those who are now to be the leaders of the new teaching should be recited at the outset, that each one may be known to have taken his share in the labour, though it will not fall within the plan of the writer to give a notice of their several works; and secondly, as all the twelve had fled before the Crucifixion, this enumeration of them as again at their post, may shew that there had been in all of them, except Judas, only weakness of the flesh, and not unwillingness of the spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may be noticed that, whereas in the list of Apostles given in St Luke’s Gospel the name of Andrew stands second in the first group of four and next after Peter, in this repeated list Andrew is placed fourth. The history gives no reason for this change, but we see in the Gospels, when important events occurred in Christ’s ministry, such as the raising of the daughter of Jaïrus, the Transfiguration, and the Agony in Gethsemane, that the three disciples chosen to be present with Jesus are Peter, James and John, but not Andrew. Whatever may have been the reason for such an omission, the fact may in some degree explain the altered position of Andrew’s name in the list of the twelve. It appears no more in Holy Writ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The order of the next group of four differs from their arrangement in the Gospel, but as none of them are mentioned after this verse there is nothing to explain the variation in order. In the next group the A. V. is inconsistent in rendering James <span class="ital">the son</span> of Alphæus, and afterwards a like construction by Judas <span class="ital">the brother</span> of James. It is more common to find this dependent genitive in descriptions of a son, though the relationship of brother to brother is found so indicated. Judas is called <span class="ital">the brother</span> of James here because it is assumed that he is the same person as the author of the Epistle of St Jude, who (Judges 1) calls himself brother of James. But as it is not certain that the writer of that Epistle was one of the twelve, it is better to render the two identical constructions standing so close together in the same way, and so to read <span class="ital">Judas</span> <span class="bld">the son</span> <span class="ital">of James</span>. James in that case would be the name of some otherwise unknown person, but it was a very common name among the Jews.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Simon Zelotes</span>] called Simon the <span class="ital">Canaanite</span> (<a href="/matthew/10-4.htm" title="Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.">Matthew 10:4</a>; <a href="/mark/3-18.htm" title="And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,">Mark 3:18</a>). The last-named title is a corruption of an Aramaic word of like meaning with the Greek <span class="ital">Zelotes</span>, and signifying Zealot, a name applied in our Lord’s time to those Jews who were most strict in their observance of the Mosaic ritual.

Where they were abiding. A slight change in the order of the words, as adopted in the text of the R.V., makes Peter and the other apostles the nominative case to the verb "went up," instead of, as in the A.V., to "abode." In regard to the list of the apostles which follows, it may be noticed first, that it is identical with that of <a href="/luke/6-14.htm">Luke 6:14-16</a>, except in the omission of Judas Iscariot and the order in which the apostles are named. The order in Luke seems to have followed that of natural birth and association. The brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, are classed together; Philip and Bartholomew, or Nathanael, go together, and so on. But in this list John follows Peter, his close companion in missionary work (<a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>, etc.; Acts 4:12; 8:14); James follows instead of preceding John; and others are classed somewhat differently, for reasons probably analogous, but which we know not. Of the other lists that in <a href="/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16-19</a> agrees most nearly with that before us. In all, Simon Peter stands <span class="accented">first.</span> The Jude of <a href="/luke/6-16.htm">Luke 6:16</a> (comp. <a href="/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>) and <a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a> is called <span class="accented">Thaddaeus</span> in <a href="/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a> (" Lebbaeus whose surname was Thaddaeus," A.V.) and in <a href="/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>; but no doubt the persons are the same. In all the lists Philip stands fifth. In three Bartholomew is sixth, while in the list in Acts his being named after Thomas makes him seventh. In all the lists James the son of Alphaeus is ninth, and Judas Iscariot the last, except in the Acts, where he is not named, being already dead.
