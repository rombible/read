It was left for the Searcher of hearts to show, by the exclusion of human will, which of the two He had chosen. The most usual way of casting lots in such cases was to write each name on a tablet, place them in an urn, and then shake the urn till one came out. A like custom prevailed among the Greeks, as in the well-known story of the stratagem of Cresphontes in the division of territory after the Doriar invasion (Sophocles, <span class= "ital">Aias.</span> 1285; comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The practice was recognised, it may be noted, in the Law (<a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm" title="And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.">Leviticus 16:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span>—The Greek word is not the same as in <a href="/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a>, and implies that Matthias was “voted in,” the suffrage of the Church unanimously confirming the indication of the divine will which had been given by the lot. It may be that the new Apostle took the place which Judas had left vacant, and was the last of the Twelve.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/1-26.htm" title="And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.">Acts 1:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">And they gave forth their lots </span>— That is, saith Grotius, they put two lots into two urns, the one containing the two names of Joseph and Matthias, the other a blank and the word <span class="ital">apostle: </span>and then drawing forth the name of Joseph and the blank, they knew that the lot containing the name of an <span class="ital">apostle </span>belonged to Matthias.

Here, therefore, commenced in the Christian Church the proper use of <span class="ital">the lot, </span>whereby a matter of importance, which cannot be determined by any ordinary method, is committed to the divine decision. <span class="ital">And he was numbered with the eleven apostles </span>— The rest of the apostles gave him the right hand of fellowship, so that for the future he made the twelfth of that venerable society of men. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-26 The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ's resurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they gave forth their lots - Some have supposed that this means they voted. But to this interpretation there are insuperable objections:<p>1. The word "lots," &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  kle&#772;rous, is not used to express votes, or suffrage.<p>2. The expression "the lot fell upon" is not consistent with the notion of voting. It is commonly expressive of casting lots.<p>3. Casting lots was common among the Jews on important and difficult occasions, and it was natural that the apostles should resort to it in this.<p>Thus, David divided the priests by lot, <a href="/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>. The land of Canaan was divided by lot, <a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1-10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17.htm">Joshua 17</a>; etc. Jonathan, son of Saul, was detected as having violated his father's command. and as bringing calamity on the Israelites by lot, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41-42</a>. Achan was detected by lot, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-16.htm">Joshua 7:16-18</a>. In these instances the use of the lot was regarded as a solemn appeal to God for his direct interference in cases which they could not themselves decide. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, "the lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord." The choice of an apostle was an event of the same kind, and was regarded as a solemn appeal to God for his direction and guidance in a case which the apostles could not determine. The manner in which this was done is not certainly known. The common mode of casting lots was to write the names of the persons on pieces of stone, wood, etc., and put them in one urn, and the name of the office, portion, etc., on others.<p>These were then placed in an urn with other pieces of stone, etc., which were blank. The names were then drawn at random, and also the other pieces, and this settled the case. The casting of a lot is determined by laws of nature as regularly as anything else. There is properly no chance in it. We do not know how a die may turn up; but this does not imply that it will turn up without any regard to rule, or at haphazard. We cannot trace the influences which may determine either this or that side to come up; but it is done by regular and proper laws, and according to the circumstances of position, force, etc., in which it is cast. Still, although it does not imply any special or miraculous interposition of Providence; though it may not be absolutely wrong, in cases which cannot otherwise be determined, to use the lot, yet it does not follow that it is proper often to make this appeal.<p>Almost all cases of doubt can be determined more satisfactorily in some other way than by the lot. The habit of appealing to it engenders the love of hazards and of games; leads to heart-burnings, to jealousies, to envy, to strife, and to dishonesty. Still less does the example of the apostles authorize games of hazard, or lotteries, which are positively evil, and attended with ruinous consequences, apart from any inquiry about the lawfulness of the lot. They either originate in, or promote covetousness, neglect of regular industry, envy, jealousy, disappointment, dissipation, bankruptcy, falsehood, and despair. What is gained by one is lost by another, and both the gain and the loss promote some of the worst passions of man boasting, triumph, self-confidence, indolence, dissipation, on the one hand; and envy, disappointment, sullenness, desire of revenge, remorse, and ruin on the other. God intended that man should live by sober toil. All departures from this great law of our social existence lead to ruin.<p>Their lots - The lots which were to decide their case. They are called theirs, because they were to determine which of them should be called to the apostolic office.<p>The lot fell - This is an expression applicable to casting lots, not to voting.<p>He was numbered - By the casting of the lot, &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;  sugkatepse&#772;phisthe&#772;. This word is from &#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  pse&#772;phos - a calculus, or pebble, by which votes were given or lots were cast. It means, that by the result of the lot he was reckoned as an apostle. Nothing further is related of Matthias in the New Testament. Where he labored, and when and where he died, is unknown; nor is there any tradition on which reliance is to be placed. The election of Matthias, however, throws some light on the organization of the church.<p>1. He was chosen to fill the place vacated by Judas, and for a specific purpose, to be a witness of the resurrection of Christ. There is no mention of any other design. It was not to ordain men exclusively, or to rule over the churches, but to be a witness to an important fact.<p>2. There is no intimation that it was designed that there should be successors to the apostles in the special duties of the apostolic office. The election was for a definite object, and was therefore temporary. It was to fill up the number originally appointed by Christ. When the purpose for which he was appointed was accomplished, the special part of the apostolic work ceased of course.<p>3. There could be no succession in future ages to the special apostolic office. They were to be witnesses of the work of Christ, and when the desired effect resulting from such a witnessing was accomplished, the office itself would cease. Hence, there is no record that after this the church even pretended to appoint successors to the apostles, and hence, no ministers of the gospel can now pretend to be their successors in the unique and original design of the appointment of the apostles. <p>4. The only other apostle mentioned in the New Testament is the apostle Paul, not appointed as the successor of the others, not with any special design except to be an apostle to the Gentiles, as the others were to the Jews, and appointed for the same end, to testify that Jesus Christ was alive, and that he had seen him after he rose, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/22-8.htm">Acts 22:8-9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14-15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/26-17.htm">Acts 26:17-18</a>. The ministers of religion, therefore, are successors of the apostles, not in their special office as witnesses, but as preachers of the Word, and as appointed to establish, to organize, to edify, and to rule the churches. The unique work of the apostleship ceased with their death. The ordinary work of the ministry, which they held in common with all others who preach the gospel, will continue to the end of time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. was numbered&#8212;"voted in" by general suffrage.<p>with the eleven apostles&#8212;completing the broken Twelve.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They gave forth their lots; </span> the manner is not so certain, nor necessary to be known; but the whole disposing of the lot being from the Lord, as <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a></span>, they were thus as it were immediately chosen by God, and were consecrated by Christ himself; no apostle ordaining another, but all of them being called and ordained by Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He was numbered with the eleven apostles; </span> the rest of the apostles, and the whole church, agreeing with that Divine choice which was made. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they gave forth their lots,....

But R.V. reads <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span>, “they gave lots for them”. R.V. margin, “unto them”. It is difficult to decide whether the expression means that they gave lots unto the candidates themselves or whether they cast lots for them—<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, on their behalf, or to see which of the two would be selected. How the lot was decided we cannot positively say. According to Hamburger (<span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie des Judentums</span>, i., 5, p. 723) the Bible does not tell us, as the expressions used point sometimes to a casting, sometimes to a drawing out, of the lots; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a> : “Quo modo et ratione uti sunt Apostoli incertum est.

The verb is used in the middle voice for condemning with others, Plut., <span class="ital">Them.</span>, 21, but as it occurs nowhere else we have no parallels to its use here. Grimm explains it “deponendo (<span class="greekheb">κατά</span>) in urnam calculo, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, <span class="ital">suffragando assigno</span> (alicui) <span class="ital">locum</span> inter (<span class="greekheb">σύν</span>)”. But here it is used rather as an equivalent of <span class="greekheb">συγκαταριθμεῖσθαι</span>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a> (and also <a href="/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>), (Blass and Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>) = <span class="greekheb">ἐναρίθμιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">συμψηφισθείς</span>, <span class="greekheb">καταριθμηθείς</span>, Hesychius. Wendt as against Meyer maintains that it is not proved that recourse was never again had to lots, because no other instance of such an appeal is recorded in Acts. But it is most significant that this one instance should be recorded between the departure of the Lord and the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, and that after Pentecost no further reference is made to such a mode of decision. <span class="ital">Cf., e.g.</span>, <a href="/acts/10-19.htm" title="While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.">Acts 10:19</a>, <a href="/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a>. With regard to the historical character of the election of Matthias, Wendt sees no ground to doubt it in the main, although he is not prepared to vouch for all the details, but he finds no reason to place such an event at a later date of the Church’s history, as Zeller proposed. To question the validity of the appointment is quite unreasonable, as not only is it presupposed in <a href="/acts/2-14.htm" title="But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my words:">Acts 2:14</a>, <a href="/acts/6-2.htm" title="Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.">Acts 6:2</a>, but even the way in which both St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm" title="And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>) and the Apocalypse (<a href="/acts/21-14.htm" title="And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.">Acts 21:14</a>) employ the number twelve in a technical sense of the Twelve Apostles, makes the after choice of Matthias as here described very probable (so Overbeck, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). No mention is made of the laying on of hands, but “non dicuntur manus novo Apostolo impositæ; erat enim prorsus immediate constitutus,” Bengel. See also on <a href="/acts/1-25.htm" title="That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.">Acts 1:25</a>, and <a href="/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ascension of our Lord</span>.—Friedrich in his <span class="ital">Das Lucasevangelium</span>, p. 47 ff., discusses not only similarity of words and phrases, but similarity of contents in St. Luke’s writings. With reference to the latter, he examines the two accounts of the Ascension as given in St. Luke’s Gospel and in the Acts. There are, he notes, four points of difference (the same four in fact as are mentioned by Zeller, <span class="ital">Acts of the Apostles</span>, i., 166, E. T.): (1) Bethany as the <span class="ital">place</span> of the Ascension, <a href="/luke/24-30.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.">Luke 24:30</a>; <a href="/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a>, the Mount of Olives; (2) the <span class="ital">time</span> of the Ascension; according to Acts the event falls on the fortieth day after the Resurrection, <a href="/acts/1-3.htm" title="To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:">Acts 1:3</a>; according to the Gospel on the Resurrection day itself; (3) the words of Jesus before the Ascension are not quite the same in the two narratives; (4) in the Gospel the words appear to be spoken in Jerusalem, in the Acts at the place of the Ascension. Friedrich points out what Zeller fully admitted, that (1) has no importance, for Bethany lay on the Mount of Olives, and the neighbourhood of Bethany might be described quite correctly as <span class="greekheb">ὄρος ἐλαιῶνος</span>; (3) is not of any great importance (as Zeller also admitted), since <a href="/context/luke/24-47.htm" title="And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem....">Luke 24:47-49</a> and <a href="/context/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me....">Acts 1:4-8</a> agree in the main. With regard to (4), Friedrich is again in agreement with Zeller in holding that the difficulty might easily be solved by supposing some slight inaccuracy, or that the words in question were uttered on the way from Jerusalem to the Mount of Olives; but he agrees also with Zeller in maintaining that the <span class="ital">time</span> of the Ascension as given in Luke’s Gospel and in Acts constitutes the only definite contradiction between the two writings. But even this difficulty presents itself to Friedrich as by no means insuperable, since the author has not attempted to avoid apparent contradictions in other places in the Acts, and therefore he need not have felt himself called upon to do so in the passage before us, where the book seems at variance with his Gospel (see pp. 48, 49).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But Friedrich proceeds to emphasise the many points in which the history of the Ascension in Acts reminds us of the close of the Gospel (see also Zeller, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, ii., pp. 226, 227, E.T., and also Feine). Only St. Luke knows of the command of Jesus, that the Apostles should not leave Jerusalem, and of the promise of the Holy Spirit associated with it, <a href="/luke/24-49.htm" title="And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.">Luke 24:49</a>, and <a href="/context/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me....">Acts 1:4-8</a>. So also <a href="/luke/24-47.htm" title="And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.">Luke 24:47</a> reminds us unmistakably of <a href="/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a>; also <a href="/luke/24-52.htm" title="And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:">Luke 24:52</a> and <a href="/acts/1-12.htm" title="Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.">Acts 1:12</a>, <a href="/luke/24-53.htm" title="And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.">Luke 24:53</a> and <a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a> (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm" title="But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my words:">Acts 2:14</a>) (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="/acts/1-5.htm" title="For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.">Acts 1:5</a> and <a href="/luke/3-16.htm" title="John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:">Luke 3:16</a>). But there is no need to adopt Friedrich’s defence of the supposed contradiction with regard to the <span class="ital">time</span> of the Ascension. Certainly in the Gospel of St. Luke nothing is said of any interval between the Resurrection and the Ascension, but it is incredible that “the author can mean that late at night, <a href="/luke/3-29.htm" title="Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,">Luke 3:29</a>; <a href="/luke/3-33.htm" title="Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda,">Luke 3:33</a>, Jesus led the disciples out to Bethany and ascended in the dark!” Plummer, <span class="ital">St. Luke</span>, p. 569, see also Felten, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 59, and Blass, <span class="ital">Acta Apostolorum</span>, p. 44. It is of course possible that St. Luke may have gained his information as to the interval of the forty days between the writing of his two works, but however this may be (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Plummer, but against this view Zöckler, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 173), it becomes very improbable that even if a tradition existed that the Ascension took place on the evening of the Resurrection, and that Luke afterwards in Acts followed a new and more trustworthy account (so Wendt), that the Evangelist, the disciple of St. Paul, who must have been acquainted with the continuous series of the appearances of the Risen Christ in 1 Corinthians 15, should have favoured such a tradition for a moment (see Zöckler, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>). On the undue stress laid by Harnack upon the famous passage in Barnabas, <span class="ital">Epist.</span>, xv., see Dr. Swete, <span class="ital">The Apostle’s Creed</span>, p. 68, Plummer, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 564, and on this point and also the later tradition of a lengthy interval, Zöckler, <span class="ital">u. s.</span> For the early testimony to the fact of the Ascension in the Apostolic writings, and for the impossibility of accounting for the belief in the fact either from O.T. precedents or from pagan myths, see Zahn, <span class="ital">Das Apostolische Symbolum</span>, pp. 76–78, and <span class="ital">Witness of the Epistles</span> (Longmans), p. 400 ff. The view of Steinneyer that St. Luke gives us a full account of the Ascension in the Acts rather than in his Gospel, because he felt that the true position of such an event was to emphasise it more as the beginning of a new period than as a conclusion of the Gospel history, <span class="ital">Die Auferstehungsgeschichte des Herrn</span>, pp. 226, 227, deserves attention, and may be fitly compared with W.H[113], <span class="ital">Notes on Select Readings</span>, p. 73.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[113] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">And they gave forth their lots</span>] Better, <span class="ital">And they</span> <span class="bld">gave lots for them</span>, in accordance with MSS. The process probably was that each member of the company wrote on a tablet or ticket the name of one of the chosen two; the whole were then placed in some vessel and shaken together, and that tablet which was first drawn out decided the election. The casting of lots, though not now permitted to the Jews (see Shulkhan Aruch <span class="ital">Joreh Deah</span> par. 179. 1), was used by a provision of the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm" title="And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.">Leviticus 16:8</a>) for the selection of one out of the two goats for the Lord. “The goat upon which the Lord’s lot fell” was offered for a sin offering. The Apostles had not yet received the Spirit which was to “guide them into all truth.” When the Holy Ghost had been given, they, as St Chrysostom notices (<span class="ital">In Act. Ap. Hom</span>. III.), used no more casting of lots.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/1-26.htm" title="And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.">Acts 1:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔδωκαν</span>, <span class="ital">they gave forth</span>) They cast.—<span class="greekheb">κλήρους αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">their lots</span>) the lots of Joseph and Matthias [not <span class="ital">their</span> own lots].
