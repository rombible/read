The position of Corinth on the Isthmus, with a harbour on either shore, Cenchreæ on the east, Lechæum on the west, had naturally made it a place of commercial importance at a very early stage of Greek history. With commerce had come luxury and vice, and the verb <span class= "ital">Corinthiazein=</span> to live as the Corinthians, had become proverbial, as early as the time of Aristophanes (<span class= "ital">Frag.</span> 133), for a course of profligacy. The harlot priestesses of the Temple of Aphrodite gave a kind of consecration to the deep dyed impurity of Greek social life, of which we find traces in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,">1Corinthians 6:9-19</a>. The Isthmian games, which were celebrated every fourth year, drew crowds of competitors and spectators from all parts of Greece, and obviously furnished the Apostle with the agonistic imagery of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.">1Corinthians 9:24-27</a>. Less distinguished for higher culture than Athens, it was yet able (standing to Athens in much the same relation as Venice did to Florence from the 13th to the 16th century) to boast of its artists in stone and metal (Corinthian bronze was proverbial for its excellence), of its rhetoricians and philosophers. On its conquest by the Roman general Mummius (B.C. 146), many of its buildings had been destroyed, and its finest statues had been carried off to Rome; and it was a Roman jest that the general had bound the captains of the ships that carried them, to replace them in case of loss. A century later, Julius Cæsar determined to restore it to its former splendour, and thousands of freed-men were employed in the work of reconstruction. Such was the scene of the Apostle’s new labours, less promising, at first sight, than Athens, but, ultimately, far more fruitful in results.<p>(1) There can be no doubt that the “vow” was that of the temporary Nazarite, as described in <a href="/context/numbers/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. It implied a separation from the world and common life (this was the meaning of the word “Nazarite”), and while under the vow the man who had taken it was to drink no wine or strong drink, and to let no razor pass over his head or face. When the term was completed, he was to shave his head at the door of the Tabernacle, and burn the hair in the fire of the altar. It will be noted that the Nazarites in <a href="/acts/21-24.htm" title="Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.">Acts 21:24</a>, who are completing their vow, <span class= "ital">shave</span> their heads. Here a different word (“shorn”) is used, which is contrasted with “shaving” in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-6.htm" title="For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.">1Corinthians 11:6</a>. It was lawful for a man to have his hair cut or cropped during the continuance of the vow, and this apparently was what St. Paul now did. But in this case also the hair so cut off was to be taken to the Temple and burnt there, and this explains the Apostle’s eagerness “by all means” (<a href="/acts/18-21.htm" title="But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.">Acts 18:21</a>) to keep the coming feast at Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/acts/18.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">PAUL AT CORINTH<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/acts/18-1.htm" title="After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;">Acts 18:1</a> - <a href="/acts/18-11.htm" title="And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.">Acts 18:11</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Solitude is a hard trial for sensitive natures, and tends to weaken their power of work. Paul was entirely alone in Athens, and appears to have cut his stay there short, since his two companions, who were to have joined him in that city, did not do so till after he had been some time in Corinth. His long stay there has several well-marked stages, which yield valuable lessons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. First, we note the solitary Apostle, seeking friends, toiling for bread, and withal preaching Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Corinth was a centre of commerce, of wealth, and of moral corruption. The celebrated local worship of Aphrodite fed the corruption as well as the wealth. The Apostle met there with a new phase of Greek life, no less formidable in antagonism to the Gospel than the culture of Athens. He tells us that he entered on his work in Corinth ‘in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling,’ but also that he did not try to attract by adaptation of his words to the prevailing tastes either of Greek or Jew, but preached ‘Jesus Christ, and Him crucified,’ knowing that, while that appeared to go right in the teeth of the demands of both, it really met their wants. This ministry was begun, in his usual fashion, very unobtrusively and quietly. His first care was to find a home; his second, to provide his daily bread; and then he was free to take the Sabbath for Christian work in the synagogue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We cannot tell whether he had had any previous acquaintance with Aquila and his wife, nor indeed is it certain that they had previously been Christians. Paul’s reason for living with them was simply the convenience of getting work at his trade, and it seems probable that, if they had been disciples, that fact would have been named as part of his reason. Pontus lay to the north of Cilicia, and though widely separated from it, was near enough to make a kind of bond as of fellow-countrymen, which would be the stronger because they had the same craft at their finger-ends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It was the wholesome practice for every Rabbi to learn some trade. If all graduates had to do the same now there would be fewer educated idlers, who are dangerous to society and burdens to themselves and their friends. What a curl of contempt would have lifted the lips of the rich men of Corinth if they had been told that the greatest man in their city was that little Jew tent-maker, and that in this unostentatious fashion he had begun to preach truths which would be like a charge of dynamite to all their social and religious order! True zeal can be patiently silent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sewing rough goat’s-hair cloth into tents may be as truly serving Christ as preaching His name. All manner of work that contributes to the same end is the same in worth and in recompense. Perhaps the wholesomest form of Christian ministry is that after the Apostolic pattern, when the teacher can say, as Paul did to the people of Corinth, ‘When I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man.’ If not in letter, at any rate in spirit, his example must be followed. If the preacher would win souls he must be free from any taint of suspicion as to money.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The second stage in Paul’s Corinthian residence is the increased activity when his friends, Silas and Timothy, came from Beroea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>We learn from <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Php 4:15</a>, and <a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>, that they brought gifts from the Church at Philippi; and from <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, that they brought something still more gladdening namely, good accounts of the steadfastness of the Thessalonian converts. The money would make it less necessary to spend most of the week in manual labour; the glad tidings of the Thessalonians’ ‘faith and love’ did bring fresh life, and the presence of his helpers would cheer him. So a period of enlarged activity followed their coming.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The reading of <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>, ‘Paul was constrained by the word,’ brings out strikingly the Christian impulse which makes speech of the Gospel a necessity. The force of that impulse may vary, as it did with Paul; but if we have any deep possession of the grace of God for ourselves, we shall, like him, feel it pressing us for utterance, as soon as the need of providing daily bread becomes less stringent and our hearts are gladdened by Christian communion. It augurs ill for a man’s hold of the word if the word does not hold him. He who never felt that he was weary of forbearing, and that the word was like a fire, if it was ‘shut up in his bones,’ has need to ask himself if he has any belief in the Gospel. The craving to impart ever accompanies real possession.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Apostle’s solemn symbolism, announcing his cessation of efforts among the Jews, has of course reference only to Corinth, for we find him in his subsequent ministry adhering to his method, ‘to the Jew first.’ It is a great part of Christian wisdom in evangelical work to recognise the right time to give up efforts which have been fruitless. Much strength is wasted, and many hearts depressed, by obstinate continuance in such methods or on such fields as have cost much effort and yielded no fruit. We often call it faith, when it is only pride, which prevents the acknowledgment of failure. Better to learn the lessons taught by Providence, and to try a new ‘claim,’ than to keep on digging and washing when we only find sand and mud. God teaches us by failures as well as by successes. Let us not be too conceited to learn the lesson or to confess defeat, and shift our ground accordingly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is a solemn thing to say ‘I am clean.’ We need to have been very diligent, very loving, very prayerful to God, and very persuasive in pleading with men, before we dare to roll all the blame of their condemnation on themselves. But we have no right to say, ‘Henceforth I go to’ others, until we can say that we have done all that man-or, at any rate, that we-can do to avert the doom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Paul did not go so far away but that any whose hearts God had touched could easily find him. It was with a lingering eye to his countrymen that he took up his abode in the house of ‘one that feared God,’ that is, a proselyte; and that he settled down next door to the synagogue. What a glimpse of yearning love which cannot bear to give Israel up as hopeless, that simple detail gives us! And may we not say that the yearning of the servant is caught from the example of the Master? ‘How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?’ Does not Christ, in His long-suffering love, linger in like manner round each closed heart? and if He withdraws a little way, does He not do so rather to stimulate search after Him, and tarry near enough to be found by every seeking heart?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Paul’s purpose in his solemn warning to the Jews of Corinth was partly accomplished. The ruler of the synagogue ‘believed in the Lord with all his house.’ Thus men are sometimes brought to decision for Christ by the apparently impending possibility of His Gospel leaving them to themselves. ‘Blessings brighten as they take their flight.’ Severity sometimes effects what forbearance fails to achieve. If the train is on the point of starting, the hesitating passenger will swiftly make up his mind and rush for a seat. It is permissible to press for immediate decision on the ground that the time is short, and that soon these things ‘will be hid from the eyes.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We learn from <a href="/1_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;">1 Corinthians 1:14</a>, that Paul deviated from his usual practice, and himself baptized Crispus. We may be very sure that his doing so arose from no unworthy subserviency to an important convert, but indicated how deeply grateful he was to the Lord for giving him, as a seal to a ministry which had seemed barren, so encouraging a token. The opposition and blasphemy of many are outweighed, to a true evangelist, by the conversion of one; and while all souls are in one aspect equally valuable, they are unequal in the influence which they may exert on others. So it was with Crispus, for ‘many of the Corinthians hearing’ of such a signal fact as the conversion of the chief of the synagogue, likewise ‘believed.’ We may distinguish in our estimate of the value of converts, without being untrue to the great principle that all men are equally precious in Christ’s eyes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The next stage is the vision to Paul and his consequent protracted residence in Corinth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>God does not waste visions, nor bid men put away fears which are not haunting them. This vision enables us to conceive Paul’s state of mind when it came to him. He was for some reason cast down. He had not been so when things looked much more hopeless. But though now he had his friends and many converts, some mood of sadness crept over him. Men like him are often swayed by impulses rising within, and quite apart from outward circumstances. Possibly he had reason to apprehend that his very success had sharpened hostility, and to anticipate danger to life. The contents of the vision make this not improbable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the mere calming of fear, worthy object as it is, is by no means the main part of the message of the vision. ‘Speak, and hold not thy peace,’ is its central word. Fear which makes a Christian dumb is always cowardly, and always exaggerated. Speech which comes from trembling lips may be very powerful, and there is no better remedy for terror than work for Christ. If we screw ourselves up to do what we fear to do, the dread vanishes, as a bather recovers himself as soon as his head has once been under water.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Why was Paul not to be afraid? It is easy to say, ‘Fear not,’ but unless the exhortation is accompanied with some good reason shown, it is wasted breath. Paul got a truth put into his heart which ends all fear-’For I am with thee.’ Surely that is enough to exorcise all demons of cowardice or despondency, and it is the assurance that all Christ’s servants may lay up in their hearts, for use at all moments and in all moods. His presence, in no metaphor, but in deepest inmost reality, is theirs, and whether their fears come from without or within, His presence is more than enough to make them brave and strong.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Paul needed a vision, for Paul had never seen Christ ‘after the flesh,’ nor heard His parting promise. We do not need it, for we have the unalterable word, which He left with all His disciples when He ascended, and which remains true to the ends of the world and till the world ends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The consequence of Christ’s presence is not exemption from attacks, but preservation in them. Men may ‘set on’ Paul, but they cannot ‘hurt’ him. The promise was literally fulfilled when the would-be accusers were contemptuously sent away by Gallio, the embodiment of Roman even-handedness and despising of the deepest things. It is fulfilled no less truly to-day; for no hurt can come to us if Christ is with us, and whatever does come is not hurt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘I have much people in this city.’ Jesus saw what Paul did not, the souls yet to be won for Him. That loving Eye gladly beholds His own sheep, though they may be yet in danger of the wolves, and far from the Shepherd. ‘Them also He must bring’; and His servants are wise if, in all their labours, they cherish the courage that comes from the consciousness of His presence, and the unquenchable hope, which sees in the most degraded and alienated those whom the Good Shepherd will yet find in the wilderness and bear back to the fold. Such a hope will quicken them for all service, and such a vision will embolden them in all peril.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/18-1.htm" title="After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;">Acts 18:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">And after these things Paul departed, </span>&c. — After having so unsuccessfully preached to the philosophers and others in Athens, the apostle judged it needless any longer to attempt the conversion of men so frivolous, easy, indolent, and wise in their own eyes. He therefore left them as incorrigible, and proceeded forward to Corinth, now become more considerable for the number, learning, and wealth of its inhabitants, than even Athens itself. Corinth was situated on an isthmus, or narrow neck of land, which joined Peloponnesus to Greece. On the east side of the isthmus were the ports of Cenchrea and Schænus, which received the merchandise of Asia, by the Saronic gulf; and on the west side, the port of Lechæum received the merchandise of Italy, Gaul, and Spain, by the Crissæan gulf. Corinth, being thus conveniently situated for commerce, soon became extremely rich and populous; and being seated on the isthmus which joined Peloponnesus to Greece, it commanded both countries. In the course of the Achæan war, the Roman consul, Mummius, burned it to the ground; but Julius Cesar rebuilt it after it had long lain in ashes. When Achaia was made a Roman province, Corinth, becoming the seat of government, soon regained its ancient celebrity, in respect of commerce and riches, but especially in respect of the number and quality of its inhabitants. For, at the time the apostle arrived, it was full of learned men, some of whom taught philosophy, rhetoric, poetry, and painting; others studied these sciences and arts; insomuch that there was no city in Greece where philosophy, and the fine arts, and learning were carried to greater perfection than at Corinth; no city in which there were more men of a cultivated understanding.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Though Paul was entitled to support from the churches he planted, and from the people to whom he preached, yet he worked at his calling. An honest trade, by which a man may get his bread, is not to be looked upon with contempt by any. It was the custom of the Jews to bring up their children to some trade, though they gave them learning or estates. Paul was careful to prevent prejudices, even the most unreasonable. The love of Christ is the best bond of the saints; and the communings of the saints with each other, sweeten labour, contempt, and even persecution. Most of the Jews persisted in contradicting the gospel of Christ, and blasphemed. They would not believe themselves, and did all they could to keep others from believing. Paul hereupon left them. He did not give over his work; for though Israel be not gathered, Christ and his gospel shall be glorious. The Jews could not complain, for they had the first offer. When some oppose the gospel, we must turn to others. Grief that many persist in unbelief should not prevent gratitude for the conversion of some to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After these things - After what occurred at Athens, as recorded in the previous chapter.<p>Came to Corinth - Corinth was the capital of Achaia, called anciently Ephyra, and was seated on the isthmus which divides the Peloponnesus from Attica. The city itself stood on a little island; it had two ports, Lecheeum on the west, and Cenchrea on the east. It was one of the most populous and wealthy cities of Greece, and at the same time one of the most luxurious, effeminate, ostentatious, and dissolute. Lasciviousness here was not only practiced and allowed, but was consecrated by the worship of Venus; and no small part of the wealth and splendor of the city arose from the offerings made by licentious passion in the very temples of this goddess. No city of ancient times was more profligate. It was the Paris of antiquity; the seat of splendor, and show, and corruption. Yet even here, notwithstanding all the disadvantages of splendor, gaiety, and dissoluteness, Paul entered on the work of rearing a church; and here he was eminently successful. The two epistles which he afterward wrote to this church show the extent of his success; and the well-known character and propensities of the people will account for the general drift of the admonitions and arguments in those epistles. Corinth was destroyed by the <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/146.htm">Romans 146</a> years before Christ; and during the conflagration several metals in a fused state, running together, produced the composition known as Corinthian brass. It was afterward restored by Julius Caesar, who planted in it a Roman colony. It soon regained its ancient splendor, and relapsed into its former dissipation and licentiousness. Paul arrived there in 52 or 53 ad. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 18<p>Ac 18:1-22.

The Arabic version renders it, "after these words, or discourses"; after the apostle's disputation with the philosophers, and his sermon in the Areopagus, the effects of which are before related: <p>Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; the metropolis of Achaia, or Peloponnesus. The city was formerly called Ephyra, from Ephyra (p), the daughter of Oceanus, and had its name of Corinth from Corinthus, the son of Maratho, who repaired it when destroyed; or, as others say, from Corinthus the son of Pelops, others of Orestes, and others of Jupiter: though more probably it was so called from the multitudes of whores in this place, as if it was , "corai entha, here are girls, or whores"; for in the temple of Venus there were no less than a thousand whores provided, to be prostituted to all comers thither; See Gill on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>. It was situated between two great seas, the Aegean and Ionean; hence (q) Horace calls it Bimaris: it had a very strong tower, built on a high mount, called Acrocorinthus, from whence these two seas might be seen, and where was the fountain Pirene, sacred to the Muses: the city was about sixty furlongs, or seven miles and a half, from the shore (r): it was a city that abounded in riches and luxury. Florus (s) calls it the head of Achaia, and the glory of Greece; and Cicero (t), the light of all Greece: it was in time so much enlarged, and became so famous, that it was little inferior to Rome itself, on which account it grew proud and haughty; and using the Roman ambassadors with some degree of insolence, who were sent into Greece, on some certain occasion, first Metellus, and then Mummius, were sent against it, which latter took it, and burnt it; and the city then abounding with images and statues of gold, silver, and brass, were melted down together in the fire, and made what was afterwards called the Corinthian brass, which became so famous, and is often spoken of in history (u): but Julius Caesar, moved with the commodious situation of the place, rebuilt it (w), and it became a colony of the Romans, as Pliny (x) and Mela (y) both call it: and so it was at this time when the apostle was there. After this it came into the hands of the Venetians, from whom it was taken by Mahomet, the second son of Amurath, in the year 1458 (z); but is now again in the hands of the Venetians; and that and the country about it are called the Morea. And as the Gospel was to be preached to the worst of sinners, among whom God's chosen ones lay, the apostle was directed to come hither; and it appears by the sequel, that God had much people here, even more than at Athens, among the wise and learned. <p>(p) Vellei Patercull Hist.

In Corinth, at which Paul had arrived after his parting from Athens (<span class="greekheb">χωρισθ</span>., comp. <a href="/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a>), he met with the Jew <span class="greekheb">Ἀκύλας</span> (Greek form of the Latin <span class="ital">Aquila</span>, which is to be considered as a Roman name adopted after the manner of the times instead of the Jewish name; see Eust. <span class="ital">ad Dion. Per.</span> 381), a native of the Asiatic province of <span class="ital">Pontus</span>, but who had hitherto resided at <span class="ital">Rome</span>, and afterwards dwelt there also (<a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>), and so probably had his dwelling-place in <span class="ital">that</span> city—an inference which is rendered the more probable, as his temporary removal to a distance from Rome had its <span class="ital">compulsory</span> occasion in the imperial edict. We make this remark in opposition to the view of Neander, who thinks that Aquila had not his permanent abode at Rome, but settled, on account of his trade, now in one and then in another great city forming a centre of commerce, such as Corinth and Ephesus. The conjecture that he was <span class="ital">a freedman of a Pontius Aquila</span> (Cic. <span class="ital">ad Famil.</span> x. 33. 4; Suet. <span class="ital">Caes.</span> 78), so that the statement <span class="greekheb">Ποντικὸν τῷ γένει</span> is an error (Reiche on <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>, de Wette), is entirely arbitrary. Whether <span class="greekheb">Πρίσκιλλα</span> (identical with <span class="ital">Prisca</span>, <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>, for, as is well known, many Roman names were also used in diminutive forms; see Grotius on Rom. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>) was a Roman by birth, or a Jewess, remains undecided. But the opinion—which has of late become common and is defended by Kuinoel, Olshausen, Lange, and Ewald—that Aquila and his wife <span class="ital">were already Christians</span> (having been so possibly at starting from Rome) when Paul met with them at Corinth, because there is no account of their conversion, is very forced. Luke, in fact, calls Aquila simply <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖον</span> (he does not say, <span class="greekheb">τινα μαθητὴν Ἰουδ</span>.), whereas elsewhere he always definitely makes known the Jewish <span class="ital">Christians;</span> and accordingly, by the subsequent <span class="greekheb">πάντας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους</span>, he places Aquila (without any distinction) among the general body of the expelled <span class="ital">Jews.</span> He also very particularly indicates as the reason of the apostle’s lodging with him, not their common Christian faith, but their common <span class="ital">handicraft</span>, <a href="/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>. It is therefore to be assumed <span class="ital">that Aquila and Priscilla were still Jews when Paul met with them at Corinth, but through their connection with him they became Christians</span>.[72] This Luke, keeping in view the apostolic labours of Paul as a whole (comp. Baumgarten, p. 578), leaves the reader to <span class="ital">infer</span>, inasmuch as he soon afterwards speaks of the Christian working of the two (<a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>). We may add that the reply to the question, whether and how far Christianity existed at all in Rome <span class="ital">before</span> the decree of Claudius (see on <span class="ital">Rom</span>., Introd. § 2), can here be of no consequence, seeing that, although there was no Christian <span class="ital">church</span> at Rome, <span class="ital">individual</span> Christians might still at any rate be found, and certainly were found, among the resident Jews there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προσφάτως</span>] <span class="ital">nuper</span> (Polyb. iii 37. 11, iii. 48. 6; Alciphr. i. 39; <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/4-3.htm" title="For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and the altar, and the house, were sanctified after the profanation.">Jdt 4:3</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/4-5.htm" title="And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of the high mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laid up victuals for the provision of war: for their fields were of late reaped.">Jdt 4:5</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-36.htm" title="Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this house ever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteous mouth.">2Ma 14:36</a>), from <span class="greekheb">πρόσφατος</span>, which properly signifies <span class="ital">fresh</span> (= <span class="ital">just slaughtered</span> or killed), then generally <span class="ital">new, of quite recent occurrence;</span> see Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn</span>. p. 374 f.; Klausen, <span class="ital">ad Aesch.

As <span class="ital">Chrestus</span> was actually a current Greek and Roman name (Philostr. <span class="ital">v. Soph</span>. ii. 11; Inscr. 194; Cic. <span class="ital">ad Fam</span>. xi. 8), it is altogether arbitrary to interpret <span class="ital">impulsore Chresto</span> otherwise than we should interpret it, if another name stood instead of <span class="ital">Chresto</span>. <span class="ital">Chrestus</span> was the name of a Jewish agitator at Rome, whose doings produced constant tumults, and led at length to the edict of expulsion.[73] See also Wieseler, p. 122, and earlier, Ernesti, <span class="ital">in Suet., l.c</span>. This we remark in opposition to the hypothesis upheld, after older interpreters in Wolf, by most modern expositors, that Suetonius had made a mistake in the name and written <span class="ital">Chresto</span> instead of <span class="ital">Christo</span>—a view, in connection with which it is either thought that the disturbances arose out of Christianity having made its way among the Jewish population at Rome and simply affected the Jews themselves, who were thrown into a ferment by it, so that the portion of them which had come to believe was at strife with that which remained unbelieving (Wassenbergh, <span class="ital">ad Valcken</span>. p. 554; Kuinoel, Hug, Credner, Baur, Gieseler, Reuss, Thiersch, Ewald; also Lehmann, <span class="ital">Stud. zur Gesch. d. apost. Zeitalt</span>., Greifsw. 1856, p. 6 ff.; Sepp, Mangold, Beyschlag in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1867, p. 652 f.; Laurent, <span class="ital">neutest. Stud</span>. p. 88, and others); or it is assumed (Paulus, Reiche, Neander, Lange, and others) that enthusiastic Messianic hopes excited the insurrection among the Jews, and that the Romans had manufactured out of the ideal person of the Messiah a rebel of the same name. While, however, the alleged error of the name has against it generally the fact that the names <span class="ital">Christus</span> and <span class="ital">Christiani</span> were well known to the Roman writers (Tacitus, Pliny, and Suetonius himself, <span class="ital">Ner</span>. 16), it may be specially urged against the <span class="ital">former</span> view, that at the time of the edict (probably in the year 52, see Anger, <span class="ital">de temp. rat</span>. p. 118; Wieseler, p. 125 ff.) the existence of an influential number of Christians at Rome, putting the Jewish population into a tumultuous ferment, is quite improbable; and against the <span class="ital">latter</span> view, that the Messianic hopes of the Jews were well enough known to the Romans in general (Tacit. <span class="ital">Hist</span>. v. 13) and to Suetonius in particular (Suet. <span class="ital">Vesp</span>. 4). Hence the change (attested by Tertull. <span class="ital">Apol</span>. 3, <span class="ital">ad nat</span>. i. 3, and by Lactant. <span class="ital">Inst. div</span>. iv. 7. 5) of <span class="ital">Christus</span> into <span class="ital">Chrestos</span> (<span class="greekheb">Χρηστός</span>) and of <span class="ital">Christianus</span> into <span class="ital">Chrestianus</span> (which pronunciation Tertullian rejects by <span class="ital">perperam</span>) may not be imputed to the compiler of a history resting on documentary authority, but to the misuse of the Roman colloquial language. Indeed, according to Tacit. <span class="ital">Ann</span>. xv. 44: “Nero … poenis affecit, quos … <span class="ital">vulgus Christianos</span> appellabat; auctor nominis ejus <span class="ital">Christus</span>,” etc., it must be assumed that that interchange of names only became usual at a <span class="ital">later</span> period; in Justin. <span class="ital">Apol</span>. I. 4, <span class="greekheb">τὸ Χρηστόν</span> is only an <span class="ital">allusion</span> to <span class="greekheb">Χριστιανοί</span>. The detailed discussion of the point does not belong to us here, except in so far as the narrative of Dio Cass. lx. 6 appears to be at variance with this passage and with Suet. <span class="ital">l.c.:</span> <span class="greekheb">τούς τε Ἰουδαίους πλεονάσαντας αὖθις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥστε χαλεπῶς ἂν ἄνευ ταραχῆς ὑπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου σφῶν τῆς πόλεως εἰρχθῆναι</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐξήλασε μὲν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ δὲ δὴ πατρίῳ νόμῳ βίῳ χρωμένους ἐκέλευσε μὴ συναθροίζεσθαι</span>.[74] This apparent contradiction is solved by our regarding what Dio Cassius relates as something <span class="ital">which happened before the edict of banishment</span> (Wieseler, p. 123, and Lehmann, p. 5, view it otherwise), and excited the Jews to the complete outbreak of insurrection.[75] The words <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰρχθῆναι</span>, which represent the ordinance as a <span class="ital">precautionary measure</span> against the outbreak of a revolt, warrant this view. From <a href="/acts/28-15.htm" title="And from there, when the brothers heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.">Acts 28:15</a> ff., <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>, it follows that the edict of Claudius, which referred not only to <span class="ital">those making the tumult</span> (Credner, <span class="ital">Einl</span>. p. 380), but, according to the express testimony of this passage, to <span class="ital">all</span> the Jews, must soon either tacitly or officially have passed into abeyance, as, indeed, it was incapable of being permanently carried into effect in all its severity. Therefore the opinion of Hug, Eichhorn, Schrader, and Hemsen, that the Jews returned to Rome only at the mild commencement of Nero’s reign, is to be rejected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πάντας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους</span>] with the exception of the proselytes, Beyschlag thinks, so that only the <span class="ital">national Jews</span> were concerned. But the proselytes of righteousness at least cannot, without arbitrariness, be excluded from the comprehensive designation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] See also Herzog in his <span class="ital">Encykl.</span> I. p. 456.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] Herzog, in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. D. Theol</span>. 1867, p. 541, rightly defends this explanation (against Pressensé). The objection is entirely unimportant, which Mangold also (<span class="ital">Römerbr</span>. 1866) has taken, that short work would have been made with an insurgent Chrestus at Rome. He might have made a timely escape. Or may he not have been actually seized and short work made of him, without thereby quenching the fire?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] Ewald, p. 346, wishes to insert <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> before <span class="greekheb">χρωμένους</span>, so that the words would apply to the Jewish-<span class="ital">Christians</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] To place the prohibition mentioned by Dio Cassius as early as the first year of Claudius, A.D. 41 (Laurent, <span class="ital">neutest. Stud</span>. p. 89 f.), does not suit the peculiar mildness and favour which the emperor on his accession showed to the Jews, according to Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xix. 5. 2 f. The subsequent severity supposes a longer experience of need for it. Laurent, after Oros. vi. 7, places the edict of expulsion as early as the ninth year of Claudius, A.D. 49; but he is in consequence driven to the artificial explanation that Aquila indeed left <span class="ital">Rome</span> in A.D. 49, but remained for some time in <span class="ital">Italy</span>, from which (ver. 2 : <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς ʼΙταλίας</span>) he only departed in A.D. 53.

St. Paul, with his keen eye for the most important and prominent stations of Roman government and the meeting points of East and West, might be expected to choose a place from whence the influence of the Gospel could spread over the whole province. Like Ephesus, Corinth lay on the great highway between East and West; like Ephesus it was, as Professor Ramsay terms it, one of the knots on the line of communication, the point of convergence for many subordinate roads. But Corinth, with all its external beauty, its wealth and fame, had become a byword for vice and infamy, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">Κορινθιάζεσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κορινθιάζειν</span>, Wetstein, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>, and references in Farrar, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, i., 557 ff., and it has not been unfairly termed the Vanity Fair of the Roman empire: at once the London and the Paris of the first century after Christ (Farrar, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 556).

The city, at this time the political capital of Greece and the residence of the Roman pro-consul, stood on the isthmus which united the Peloponnesus to the mainland, and through it all land traffic between the peninsula and the rest of Greece must pass, while its two harbours, one on each side of the neck of land on which Corinth stood, made it the resort of seafaring traders both from east and west. Of Lechæum, the western port, on the Corinthian gulf, we have no mention in the New Testament, but Cenchreæ, the harbour on the Saronic gulf, by which communication with the East was kept up, is mentioned in <a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>.

(See <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain....">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>, &c.)

But as the double journey of the Beroeans, who accompanied him to Athens, back to Beraea, and of Timothy from Beraea to Athens, amounted to above five hundred miles (Lewin, p. 268), we cannot suppose it to have been less than a month; and it may have been a good deal more. His reasonings in the synagogue with the Jews and devout Greeks, apparently on successive sabbaths, his daily disputations in the Agora, apparently not begun till after he had "waited" some time for Silas and Timothy, the knowledge he had acquired of the numerous temples and altars at Athens, and the phrase with which this chapter begins, all indicate a stay of some length. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Corinth</span>. If by land, a forty miles' or two days' journey, through Eleusis and Megara; if by sea, a day's sail. Lewin thinks he came by sea, and that it was in winter, and that possibly one of the shipwrecks mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a> may have occurred at this time. <span class="accented">Corinth</span>, at this time a Roman colony, the capital of the province of Achaia, and the residence of the proconsul. It was a great commercial city, the center of the trade of the Levant, and consequently a great resort of the Jews. It had a very large Greek population. Ancient Corinth had been destroyed by Mummins, surnamed Achaicus, R.C. 146, and remained waste (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>) many years. Julius Caesar founded a Roman colony on the old site (Howson), "consisting principally of freedmen, among whom were great numbers of the Jewish race." Corinth, as a Roman colony, had its duumviri, as appears by coins of the reign of Claudius (Lewin, p. 270. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Found<p>"A Jewish guild always keeps together, whether in street or synagogue. In Alexandria the different trades sat in the synagogue arranged into guilds; and St. Paul could have no difficulty in meeting, in the bazaar of his trade, with the like-minded Aquila and Priscilla" (Edersheim, "Jewish Social Life"). </body></html>
