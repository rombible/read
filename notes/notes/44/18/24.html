The facts in the New Testament connected with him show that he occupied a prominent position in the history of the Apostolic Church. Conjectures, more or less probable, indicate a yet more representative character and a wider range of influence. Luther, looking to the obviously Alexandrian character of the Epistle to the Hebrews and to the mystery which shrouds its authorship, and which led Origen to the conclusion that God alone knew who wrote it, hazarded the thought that Apollos was the writer. Later critics have adopted the hypothesis, and have brought it to a closer approximation to certainty by an induction from numerous parallelisms in thought and language between the Epistle and the writings of Philo, who lived between B.C. 20 and A.D. 40 or 50. The present writer has carried the inquiry one step further. Among the ethical books of the LXX. there is one, the Wisdom of Solomon, the authorship of which is also an unsolved problem. It is not named or quoted by any pre-Christian writer, Clement of Rome being the first writer who shows traces of its influence, just as he is the first who reproduces the thoughts of the Epistle to the Hebrews. It has been ascribed to Philo partly on the external evidence of a doubtful passage in the Muratorian Canon, partly on the internal evidence of numerous coincidences with his writings. A careful comparison of the two books shows so close an agreement in style and language between the Wisdom of Solomon and the Epistle to the Hebrews that it is scarcely possible to resist the inference that they must have come from the same pen, and that they represent, therefore, different stages in the spiritual growth of the same man. Those who wish to carry the inquiry further will find the subject discussed at length in two papers, “On the Writings of Apollos,” in Vol. I. of the <span class= "ital">Expositor.</span> Without assuming more than the probability of this inference, it is yet obvious that a Jew coming from Alexandria at this time could hardly fail to have come under Philo’s influence, and that his mode of interpreting the Scriptures would naturally present many analogies to that of the Alexandrian thinker. To him accordingly may be assigned, without much risk of error, the first introduction of the characteristic idea of Philo that the Unseen Godhead manifests itself in the <span class= "ital">Logos, </span>the Divine <span class= "ital">Word, </span>or <span class= "ital">Thought, </span>as seen in the visible creation, and in the spirit and heart of man (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/9-1.htm" title="O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,">Wisdom Of Solomon 9:1-2</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/9-4.htm" title="Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children:">Wisdom Of Solomon 9:4</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/16-12.htm" title="For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaister, that restored them to health: but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.">Wisdom Of Solomon 16:12</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/18-15.htm" title="Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,">Wisdom Of Solomon 18:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>). It will be remembered that Jews of Alexandria were among those who disputed with Stephen (<a href="/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a>). Some of these may have been more or less persuaded by his. preaching, and have carried back to their native city some knowledge, more or less complete, of the new faith.<p><span class= "bld">An eloquent man.</span>—The Greek adjective implies learning as well as eloquence. It was applied pre-eminently to those who wrote history with fulness and insight (Herod. i. 1; ii. 3, 77). The treatment of the history of Israel both in Wisdom 10, 11, 18, and Hebrews 11 might well be described by it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/18-24.htm" title="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus....">Acts 18:24-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">And a certain Jew, </span>&c. — While Paul was thus visiting the churches of Galatia and Phrygia, there came to Ephesus <span class="ital">a Jew, named Apollos </span>— A native of Alexandria in Egypt; <span class="ital">an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures </span>— Namely, those of the Old Testament. Observe, reader, every talent may be of use in the kingdom of Christ, if joined with the knowledge of the Scriptures, and fervour of spirit. Now <span class="ital">this man was instructed — </span>Though not perfectly; <span class="ital">in the way of the Lord </span>— In the doctrine of Christ; <span class="ital">and being fervent in spirit </span>— That is, earnestly desirous of promoting the progress of truth, and the conversion of souls; <span class="ital">he spake and taught diligently </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ακριβως</span>, <span class="ital">accurately, </span>or with exactness, according to the best light he had; <span class="ital">knowing only the baptism of John </span>— That is, what John taught those whom he baptized, namely, the nature and necessity of repentance toward God, and faith in a Messiah shortly to appear. It is thought he had heard John the Baptist preach, and had become his disciple in Judea: if so, as John was beheaded more than twenty years before this time, and as Apollos seems to have had little or no knowledge of the Christians, it is probable he had not remained in Judea, but had returned to Alexandria, his native city, after he had been baptized by John, and had continued there till nearly the time of his coming to Ephesus. Hence he had had no opportunity of being fully acquainted with the doctrines of the gospel, as delivered by Christ and his apostles. <span class="ital">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue </span>— Pleading the cause of God and real vital religion with an earnestness becoming the importance of the subject, as well as freely reproving the Jews for their vices, which were so commonly practised among them, and showing the vanity of those hopes which, as the seed of Abraham, and the disciples of Moses, they were so ready to entertain. <span class="ital">Whom when Aquila and Priscilla </span>— Being then at Ephesus; <span class="ital">had heard </span>— Perceiving that he manifested an upright mind, and great zeal for the worship and service of the living and true God; <span class="ital">they took him unto them </span>— Probably to their house; <span class="ital">and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly — </span>By informing him that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ, whose coming John had announced, and by assuring him that John had even pointed him out as the Christ to his disciples. Besides, these well- instructed Christians, who, during Paul’s abode with them, had gained a perfect knowledge of the gospel, doubtless gave Apollos a particular account of the supernatural conception and birth, of the doctrine, miracles, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus; and informed him that he had proved himself to be the Christ, not only by his miracles and resurrection, but by his baptizing his disciples <span class="ital">with the Holy Ghost and with fire, </span>as John had foretold.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:24-28 Apollos taught in the gospel of Christ, as far as John's ministry would carry him, and no further. We cannot but think he had heard of Christ's death and resurrection, but he was not informed as to the mystery of them. Though he had not the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, as the apostles, he made use of the gifts he had. The dispensation of the Spirit, whatever the measure of it may be, is given to every man to profit withal. He was a lively, affectionate preacher; fervent in spirit. He was full of zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of precious souls. Here was a complete man of God, thoroughly furnished for his work. Aquila and Priscilla encouraged his ministry, by attendance upon it. They did not despise Apollos themselves, or undervalue him to others; but considered the disadvantages he had laboured under. And having themselves got knowledge in the truths of the gospel by their long intercourse with Paul, they told what they knew to him. Young scholars may gain a great deal by converse with old Christians. Those who do believe through grace, yet still need help. As long as they are in this world, there are remainders of unbelief, and something lacking in their faith to be perfected, and the work of faith to be fulfilled. If the Jews were convinced that Jesus is Christ, even their own law would teach them to hear him. The business of ministers is to preach Christ. Not only to preach the truth, but to prove and defend it, with meekness, yet with power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And a certain Jew named Apollos - Apollos afterward became a distinguished and successful preacher of the gospel, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>.

What was the exact influence of his Alexandrian training upon Apollos we are not told, but as a cultured Jew of such a centre of Hellenistic influence, it is quite possible that Aquila and Priscilla chose him for the work at Corinth because they thought that his training and learning would attract the attention of a Corinthian audience. Possibly his preaching may have included some Philonian speculations, but the difference between him and St. Paul in their teaching at Corinth may have consisted in outward form and delivery rather than in substance; see Canon Evans, <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span>, iii., p. 240.

(Cp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">born at Alexandria</span> (lit. an Alexandrian by birth)] On Alexandria as a place abounding with Jews cp. <a href="/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a>. It was in Alexandria and by Jews that the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament was made.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an eloquent man</span>] The word in the original expresses not only ability as an orator, but also the possession of stores of learning. Hence the <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> gives “learned.” Either rendering only gives half the idea. He was learned and could use his learning with effect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">came to Ephesus</span>, <span class="bld">and he was</span> <span class="ital">mighty in the Scriptures</span>] This is the arrangement and construction of the original. The study of the Old Testament flourished greatly in Alexandria, and Apollos had great power in the exposition and application of these Scriptures. The literary activity and philosophic pursuits of the Greek population of Alexandria were not without their effect on the more conservative Jews, and we find from many sources that the Jewish writings were studied with all the literary exactness which marked the Greek scholarship of the time, and the Jews, conscious of the antiquity of their own records and yet impressed with the philosophic character of their cultured fellow-citizens, bent themselves greatly to find analogies between the Mosaic writings and the teachings of the schools. In study like this Apollos had no doubt been fully trained.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/18-24.htm" title="And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.">Acts 18:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀλεξανδρεὺς</span>, <span class="ital">an Alexandrian</span>) That city was the seat of all branches of learning.—<span class="greekheb">λόγιος</span>) <span class="ital">learned, eloquent</span>. All accomplishments may be made useful in the kingdom of GOD, if pride do not accompany them: but especially there ought to be with them <span class="ital">power in the Scriptures</span>, and fervour of the Spirit, whereby even ordinary attainments are strengthened. And yet the fruit springs from <span class="ital">grace</span>, not from human attainments or accomplishments: <a href="/acts/18-27.htm" title="And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:">Acts 18:27</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - Now for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">an Alexandrian by race</span> for <span class="accented">born at Alexandria</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">learned</span> for <span class="accented">eloquent</span>, A.V.

From ver. 24 to ver. 28 is a distinct episode, and an important one, as containing the first mention of a very remarkable man, Apollos (a short form of <span class="accented">Apollonius</span>, like Epaphras for <span class="accented">Epaphroditus</span>) of Alexandria, a city destined to play a conspicuous part in Church history, as the traditional Church and see of St. Mark, the school of the Neoplatonists, the scene of the labors of Origen, Clement, and many other men of note, and the birthplace of the Gnostic leaders Cerinthus, Basilides, and Valentinus. The notices of Apollos in the New Testament are <a href="/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4, 5, 6, 22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>; <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; and all show St. Paul's high esteem for him. It was no more his fault than St. Peter's and St. Paul's that the factious Corinthians elevated him, or rather degraded him, into the leader of a party, Eloquent seems to be a better translation of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here than <span class="accented">learned.</span> The Greek word, which only occurs here in the New Testament, has both meanings. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Eloquent (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in New Testament. The word is used in Greek literature in several senses. As &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; means either reason or speech, so this derivative may signify either one who has thought much, and has much to say, or one who can say it well. Hence it is used: 1. Of one skilled in history. Herodotus, for example, says that the Heliopolitans are the most learned in history (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) of all the Egyptians. 2. Of an eloquent person. An epithet of Hermes or Mercury, as the god of speech and eloquence. 3. Of a learned person generally. There seems hardly sufficient reason for changing the rendering of the A. V. (Rev., learned), especially as the scripture-learning of Apollos is specified in the words mighty in the scriptures, and his superior eloquence appears to have been the reason why some of the Corinthians preferred him to Paul.
