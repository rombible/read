It was right in Gallio that he left the Jews to themselves in matters relating to their religion, but yet would not let them, under pretence of that, persecute another. But it was wrong to speak slightly of a law and religion which he might have known to be of God, and which he ought to have acquainted himself with. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus be the Messiah, and whether the gospel be a Divine revelation, are not questions of words and names, they are questions of vast importance. Gallio spoke as if he boasted of his ignorance of the Scriptures, as if the law of God was beneath his notice. Gallio cared for none of these things. If he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it was commendable; but if he concerned not himself for the abuses done to good men, his indifference was carried too far. And those who see and hear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no feeling with them, or care for them, who do not pity and pray for them, are of the same spirit as Gallio, who cared for none of these things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he drave them ... - He refused to hear and decide the controversy.

Against this may be urged the very part which Sosthenes, as ruler of the synagogue, evidently plays <span class="ital">against</span> Paul;[80] and not less <span class="ital">the</span> circumstance, that the person mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,">1 Corinthians 1:1</a> was a fellow-labourer of Paul <span class="ital">out of Corinth;</span> according to which, for the identification of the two, a more extended hypothesis would be necessary, such as Ewald has.

The proconsul would be attended by his lictors and other officials, and those he now commands to clear the place of these troublesome cavillers about words and names. The new magistrate found perhaps enough to do in matters which came within his jurisdiction in the busy mercantile life of Corinth.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he drave them</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, found only here in the New Testament or LXX.
