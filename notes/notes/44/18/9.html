He had seen the Lord at his conversion (<a href="/context/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4-6</a>), he had heard the same voice and seen the same form in his trance in the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>). Now he saw and heard them once more. “In visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men,” he passed from the strife of tongues into the presence of the Divine Friend. The words “Be not afraid” imply that he too was subject to fear and depression, and felt keenly the trial of seeming failure and comparative isolation. His converts came chiefly from the slave or freed-man class, and those of a culture like his own, whether Greeks or Jews, were slow to accept his preaching (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-26.htm" title="For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:">1Corinthians 1:26-27</a>). And then, too, he carried, as it were, his life in his hands. The reviling of the Jews might any hour burst into furious violence or deliberate plots of assassination. No wonder that he needed the gracious words, “Be not afraid.” The temptation of such a moment of human weakness was to fall back, when words seem fruitless, into the safety of silence, and therefore the command followed, “Speak, and hold not thy peace.” We are reminded of the like passing mood of discouragement in one great crisis of Elijah’s life (<a href="/context/1_kings/19-4.htm" title="But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.">1Kings 19:4-14</a>), yet more, perhaps, of its frequent recurrence in Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/1-6.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.">Jeremiah 1:6-8</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/15-15.htm" title="O LORD, you know: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in your long-suffering: know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.">Jeremiah 15:15-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:...">Acts 18:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then spake the Lord </span>— The Lord Jesus; <span class="ital">in the night by a vision to Paul </span>— Who, probably, had been discouraged in view of the learning, politeness, and grandeur of many Gentile inhabitants of the city, to whom he was to speak, so that he was, as he himself expresses it, (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>,) <span class="ital">among them in weakness and fear, and in much trembling; </span>which alarms were probably much increased by the violent assaults which had been made upon him in other places, and the contempt with which he had generally been treated: <span class="ital">Be not afraid, but speak — </span>My gospel boldly and courageously; <span class="ital">and hold not thy peace </span>— Be not silent through any present discouragement or future apprehension; <span class="ital">for I am with thee </span>— By my powerful and gracious presence, to protect, support, and comfort thee; <span class="ital">and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee </span>— A promise this which was fulfilled to Paul and also to others of God’s servants; so that whatsoever troubles they met with, even when they were killed, they were not hurt, <a href="/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/context/romans/8-36.htm" title="As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter....">Romans 8:36-39</a>. <span class="ital">For I have much people in this city </span>— So he prophetically calls them that he foreknew would believe. <span class="ital">And he continued there a year and six months </span>— A long time!

For it is reasonable to suppose that the apostle occasionally left Corinth, and went into the adjacent country of Peloponnesus, where there were many synagogues of the Jews, especially in the chief cities; and that, having preached to the Jews and Gentiles in those cities, he returned again to Corinth. This supposition is countenanced by Paul himself, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.">2 Corinthians 11:10</a>, where he intimates that he preached in the <span class="ital">region of Achaia, </span>and where, according to <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, he made many disciples.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:7-11 The Lord knows those that are his, yea, and those that shall be his; for it is by his work upon them that they become his.

To this he may allude in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>; "And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling." In such circumstances it pleased God to meet him, and disarm his fears. This he did by assuring him of success. The fact that God had much people in that city <a href="/acts/18-10.htm">Acts 18:10</a> was employed to remove his apprehensions. The prospect of success in the ministry, and the certainty of the presence of God, will take away the fear of the rich, the learned, and the great. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-11.
