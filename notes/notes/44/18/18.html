The fact is noted as following on Gallio’s repression of the enmity of the Jews. The Apostle could stay and work on without molestation. The time of his voyage was probably, as in the second journey from Corinth to Jerusalem, after the Passover, and before Pentecost. (See Note on <a href="/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a>.) It was the most favourable time of the year for travelling, and it brought the Apostle into contact with a larger number both of Hellenistic Jews and Hebrews than were found at other times. We can only infer, more or less conjecturally, the motives of his journey. (1) As afterwards, in <a href="/context/acts/20-3.htm" title="And there stayed three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.">Acts 20:3-4</a>, he may have wished, in carrying out the terms of the compact with the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>), to be the bearer of alms collected for the disciples there. By some writers, however, this visit is identified with that of which St. Paul there speaks. (2) The vow which he had taken (see Note below) required a visit to the Temple for its completion. (3) There might be a natural wish to report, as in <a href="/acts/15-4.htm" title="And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.">Acts 15:4</a>, the results of his ministry among the Gentiles, in what, from the stand-point of Jerusalem, would seem the remoter regions of Macedonia and Achaia.<p><span class= "bld">Priscilla and Aquila.</span>—On the priority given to the name of the wife, see Note on <a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</span>—The grammatical structure of the Greek sentence makes it possible to refer the words to Aquila as well as St. Paul, but there is hardly the shadow of a doubt that the latter is meant. (1) If Aquila had taken the vow he too would have to go to Jerusalem instead of remaining at Ephesus. (2) The language of St. James in <a href="/context/acts/21-23.htm" title="Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;">Acts 21:23-24</a>, implies a conviction, as resting on past experience, that St. Paul would willingly connect himself with those who had such a vow. It remains to inquire (1) as to the nature and conditions of the vow; (2) as to St. Paul’s motives in taking it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Paul after this </span>— After these tumultuous proceedings, and the opposition that was raised against him at Corinth by the Jews; <span class="ital">tarried there yet a good while </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ημερας ικανας</span>, <span class="ital">many days, </span>after the year and six months, mentioned <a href="/acts/18-11.htm" title="And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.">Acts 18:11</a>, to confirm the brethren. <span class="ital">And then took his leave, and sailed into Syria </span>— That is, in order to return thither; <span class="ital">and with him Priscilla and Aquila </span>— His two intimate friends; <span class="ital">having shorn his head in Cenchrea </span>— Commentators are much divided in opinion, whether this is spoken of Aquila or Paul. Chrysostom, Grotius, Heinsius, Hammond, and Witsius, with many others, refer it to the former; but Jerome, Augustin, Beda, Calmet, Whitby, Doddridge, Dodd, and Macknight, understand it of Paul. And it seems more probable from the construction, that this clause, and the beginning of the next verse, should refer to the same person, that is, to Paul. “Aquila being left at Ephesus, and not going up to Jerusalem as Paul did, hence I conclude,” says Dr. Whitby, “that the vow was made by Paul.” Macknight’s paraphrase on the clause is, “They took ship at Cenchrea, the eastern port of Corinth, where Paul shaved his head, and thereby put a period to the duration of a vow which he had made, perhaps, on occasion of the great deliverance he had obtained, when the Jews made insurrection against him.” What sort of a vow this was we are not informed. Salmasius has justly observed, it could not be a vow of <span class="ital">Nazariteship, </span>for then the hair must have been burned in the temple, under the caldron in which the peace-offerings were boiled, <a href="/numbers/6-18.htm" title="And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.">Numbers 6:18</a>. It was the custom, it seems, on the accomplishment of vows, for persons to shave their heads, <a href="/context/acts/21-23.htm" title="Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;...">Acts 21:23-24</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 While Paul found he laboured not in vain, he continued labouring. Our times are in God's hand; we purpose, but he disposes; therefore we must make all promises with submission to the will of God; not only if providence permits, but if God does not otherwise direct our motions. A very good refreshment it is to a faithful minister, to have for awhile the society of his brethren. Disciples are compassed about with infirmity; ministers must do what they can to strengthen them, by directing them to Christ, who is their Strength. Let us earnestly seek, in our several places, to promote the cause of Christ, forming plans that appear to us most proper, but relying on the Lord to bring them to pass if he sees good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And sailed thence into Syria - Or set sail for Syria. His design was to go to Jerusalem to the festival which was soon to occur, <a href="/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a>.<p>Having shorn his head - Many interpreters have supposed that this refers to Aquila, and not to Paul. But the connection evidently requires us to understand it of Paul, though the Greek construction does not with certainty determine to which it refers. The Vulgate refers it to Aquila, the Syriac to Paul.<p>In Cenchrea - Cenchrea was the eastern port of Corinth. A church was formed in that place, <a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>.<p>For he had a vow - A "vow" is a solemn promise made to God respecting anything. The use of vows is observable throughout the Scripture. Jacob, going into Mesopotamia, vowed one-tenth of his estate, and promised to offer it at Bethel to the honor of God, <a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>. Moses made many regulations in regard to vows. A man might devote himself or his children to the Lord. He might devote any part of his time or property to his service. The vow they were required sacredly to observe <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-22</a>, except in certain specified cases they were permitted to redeem what had been thus devoted. The most remarkable vow among the Jews was that of the Nazarite, by which a man made a solemn promise to God to abstain from wine, and from all intoxicating liquors, to let the hair grow, not to enter any house polluted by having a dead body in it, or to attend any funeral. This vow generally lasted eight days, sometimes a month, sometimes during a definite period fixed by themselves, and sometimes during their whole lives. When the vow expired, the priest made an offering of a he-lamb for a burnt-offering, a she-lamb for an expiatory sacrifice, and a ram for a peace-offering. The priest then, or some other person, shaved the head of the Nazarite at the door of the tabernacle, and burnt the hair on the fire of the altar. Those who made the vow out of Palestine, and who could not come to the temple when the vow was expired, contented themselves with observing the abstinence required by the Law, and cutting off the hair where they were. This I suppose to have been the case with Paul. His hair he cut off at the expiration of the vow at Cenchrea, though he delayed to perfect the vow by the proper ceremonies until he reached Jerusalem, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-24</a>. Why Paul made this vow, or on what occasion, the sacred historian has not informed us, and conjecture, perhaps, is useless. We may observe, however:<p>(1) That if was common for the Jews to make such vows to God, as an expression of gratitude or of devotedness to his service, when they had been raised up from sickness, or delivered from danger or calamity. See Josephus, i. 2, 15. Vows of this nature were also made by the Gentiles on occasions of deliverance from any signal calamity (Juvenal, Sat., 12, 81). It is possible that Paul may have made such a vow in consequence of signal deliverance from some of the numerous perils to which he was exposed. But,<p>(2) There is reason to think that it was mainly with a design to convince the Jews that he did not despise their law, and was not its enemy. See <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-22.htm">Acts 21:22-24</a>. In accordance with the custom of the nation, and in compliance with a law which was not wrong in itself, he might have made this vow, not for a time-serving purpose, but in order to conciliate them, and to mitigate their anger against the gospel. See <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-21</a>. But where nothing is recorded, conjecture is useless. Those who wish to see the subject discussed may consult Grotius and Kuinoel in loco; Spencer, De Legibus Hebrae., p. 862; and Calmet's Dictionary, "Nazarite." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Paul &#8230; tarried &#8230; yet a good while&#8212;During his long residence at Corinth, Paul planted other churches in Achaia (2Co 1:1).<p>then took &#8230; leave of the brethren, and sailed &#8230; into&#8212;rather, "for"<p>Syria&#8212;to Antioch, the starting-point of all the missions to the Gentiles, which he feels to be for the present concluded.<p>with him Priscilla and Aquila&#8212;In this order the names also occur in Ac 18:26 (according to the true reading); compare Ro 16:3; 2Ti 4:19, which seem to imply that the wife was the more prominent and helpful to the Church. Silas and Timotheus doubtless accompanied the apostle, as also Erastus, Gaius, and Aristarchus (Ac 19:22, 29). Of Silas, as Paul's associate, we read no more. His name occurs last in connection with Peter and the churches of Asia Minor [Webster and Wilkinson].<p>having shorn his head in Cenchrea&#8212;the eastern harbor of Corinth, about ten miles distant, where a church had been formed (Ro 16:1).<p>for he&#8212;Paul.<p>had a vow&#8212;That it was the Nazarite vow (Nu 6:1-27) is not likely. It was probably one made in one of his seasons of difficulty or danger, in prosecution of which he cuts off his hair and hastens to Jerusalem to offer the requisite sacrifice within the prescribed thirty days [Josephus, Wars of the Jews, 2.15.1]. This explains the haste with which he leaves Ephesus (Ac 18:21), and the subsequent observance, on the recommendation of the brethren, of a similar vow (Ac 21:24). This one at Corinth was voluntary, and shows that even in heathen countries he systematically studied the prejudices of his Jewish brethren.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A good while; </span> a year and a half in all, as some think, which is mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/18-11.htm" title="And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.">Acts 18:11</a></span>, by a prolepsis; or, besides that year and a half there spoken of. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Took his leave of the brethren; </span> ordering every thing as if he were to have taken his last farewell of them, as it fell out accordingly: howsoever, holy men live in a constant expectation of their dissolution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Priscilla and Aquila:</span> that the wife’s name is here put before the husband’s, have caused various conjectures; and it is observed, that in St. Paul’s Epistles, whereas there are three times only mention of them both together, viz. <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a> <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you.

Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>).[82] On the other hand, appeal is no doubt made to <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a> (comp. <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm" title="Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.">2 Timothy 4:19</a>), where also the wife stands first (see especially, Neander, p. 349, and Zeller, p. 304); but Paul here followed a point of view determining his arrangement (see on <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>), which was <span class="ital">not</span> followed by Luke in his history, as is evident from <a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>; <a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>. Accordingly, we do not need to have recourse to <span class="ital">the</span> argument, that it could not but at all events be very strange to see the liberal Paul thus, entirely without any higher necessity or determining occasion given from without (the case in <a href="/acts/21-23.htm" title="Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;">Acts 21:23</a> ff. is different), voluntarily engaging himself in a Jewish votive ceremony. How many occasions for vows had he in his varied fortunes, but we never find a trace that he <span class="ital">thus</span> became a Jew to the Jews! If there had been at that time a special reason for accommodation to such an exceptionally legal ceremony, Luke would hardly have omitted to give some more precise indication of it (comp. <a href="/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>), and would not have mentioned the matter merely thus in passing, as if it were nothing at all strange and exceptional in Paul’s case. Of <span class="ital">Aquila</span>, a subordinate, he might throw in thus, without stating the precise circumstances, the cursory notice how it happened that the married couple joined Paul on his departure at the seaport; regarding <span class="ital">Paul</span> as the bearer of such a vow, he could not but have entered into particulars. Nothing is gained by <span class="ital">importing</span> suggestions of some particular design; <span class="ital">e.g</span>. Erasmus here discovers an <span class="ital">obsequium charitatis</span> toward the Jews, to whom Paul had appeared as a despiser of their legal customs (and so in substance Lange, apost. Zeitalt. II. p. 249 f.); Bengel supposes[83] that the purpose of the apostle was: “ut necessitatem sibi imponeret celeriter peragendi iter hoc Hierosolymitanum;” Neander presupposes some occasion for the public expression of gratitude to God in the spirit of Christian wisdom; and Baumgarten thinks that “we should hence infer that Paul, during his working at Corinth, lived in the state of weakness and self-denial appointed by the law and placed under a special constitution;”[84] whereas Zeller uses the reference to Paul in order to prove a design of the writer to impute to him Jewish piety.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΚΕΓΧΡΕΑῖς</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΚΕΓΧΡΕΑῚ</span></span></span> (in Thuc. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΕΓΧΡΕΙΑΊ</span></span></span>) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΏΜΗ ΚΑῚ ΛΙΜῊΝ ἈΠΈΧΩΝ Τῆς ΠΌΛΕΩς ὍΣΟΝ ἙΒΔΟΜΉΚΟΝΤΑ ΣΤΆΔΙΑ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤΟΎΤῼ ΜῈΝ ΟὖΝ ΧΡῶΝΤΑΙ ΠΡῸς ΤΟῪς ἘΚ Τῆς ἈΣΊΑς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΡῸς ΔῈ ΤΟῪς ἘΚ Τῆς ἸΤΑΛΊΑς Τῷ ΛΕΧΑΊῼ</span></span></span>, Strabo, viii. 6, p. 380.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἾΧΕ ΓᾺΡ ΕὐΧΉΝ</span></span></span>] states the reason of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΕΙΡΆΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΕΦ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>: <span class="ital">for he had a vow</span> on him, which he discharged by having his head shorn at Cenchreae.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The vow</span> itself is <span class="ital">not</span> to be considered as a <span class="ital">Nazarite vow</span> (Numbers 6), called by Philo <span class="greekheb">εὐχὴ μεγάλη</span>, according to which a man bound himself, for the glory of Jehovah, to permit his hair to grow for a certain time and to abstain from all intoxicating drink (“Tres species sunt prohibitae Nasiraeis, immundities, tonsura et quicquid de vite egreditur” (<span class="ital">Mischna Nasir</span>, vi. 1), and then after the lapse of the consecrated time to have his hair shorn off before the temple, and to present a sacrifice, into the flames of which the hair was cast. See Num. <span class="ital">l.c.;</span> Ewald, <span class="ital">Alterth.</span> p. 113 ff. Comp. on <a href="/acts/21-23.htm" title="Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;">Acts 21:23</a> ff. For the redemption of such a vow had to take place, as formerly at the tabernacle, so afterwards at the temple and consequently <span class="ital">in Jerusalem</span>, Numbers 6, Reland, <span class="ital">Antiquitt.</span> p. 277; and entirely without proof Grotius holds: “haec praecepta … eos non obligabant, qui extra Judaeam agebant.” If it is assumed (Wolf, Stolz, Rosenmüller) that the Nazarite vow had in this case been interrupted by a Levitical uncleanness, such as by contact with a dead person (according to Lange, by intercourse with Gentiles), and was begun anew by the shearing off of the hair already consecrated but now polluted (<a href="/numbers/6-9.htm" title="And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.">Numbers 6:9</a>), this is a mere empty supposition, as the simple <span class="greekheb">εἶχε γὰρ εὐχήν</span> indicates nothing at all extraordinary. And even the renewal of an interrupted Nazarite vow was bound to the temple. See <a href="/numbers/6-10.htm" title="And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 6:10</a>. Therefore a proper Nazarite vow is here entirely out of the question; it is to be understood <span class="ital">as a private vow (votum civile) which Aquila had resting upon him, and which he discharged at Cenchreae by the shaving of his head</span>. On the occasion of some circumstances unknown to us,—perhaps under some distress, in view of eventual deliverance,—he had vowed to let his hair grow for a certain time; this time had now elapsed, and therefore he had his head shorn at Cenchreae. Comp. Salmasius, <span class="ital">de coma</span>, p. 710; Wolf, <span class="ital">Cur. in loc.;</span> Spencer, <span class="ital">de leg. Jud. rit.</span> p. 862 ff. The permitting the hair to grow is, in the Nazarite state, according to <a href="/numbers/6-7.htm" title="He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is on his head.">Numbers 6:7</a>, nothing else than <span class="ital">the sign of complete consecration to God</span> (whence also <a href="/judges/16-17.htm" title="That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor on my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.">Jdg 16:17</a> is to be explained), comp. Ewald, <span class="ital">Alterth.</span> p. 115, not that of a blessed, flourishing life, which meaning Bähr, <span class="ital">Symbol.</span> II. p. 432 f., imports (comp. in opposition to this, Keil, <span class="ital">Archäol.</span> § lxvii. 11); nor yet, from the later view of common life, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?">1 Corinthians 11:14</a>, a representation of man’s renunciation of his dignity and of his subjection to God (Baumgarten), which is entirely foreign to the matter. In a corresponding manner is the usage in the case of the vow to be understood. For the vow was certainly analogous to the Nazarite state (see Ewald, <span class="ital">Alterth.</span> p. 28 f.), in so far as one idea lay at the root of both; but it was again specifically different from it, as not requiring the official intervention of the priests, and as not bound to the temple and to prescribed forms. Neander correctly describes the <span class="greekheb">εὐχή</span> in this passage (comp. Bengel) as a <span class="ital">modification of the Nazarite vow;</span> but for this very reason it seems erroneous that he takes the shearing of the head as the <span class="ital">commencement</span> of the redemption of the vow, and not as its <span class="ital">termination</span>.[85] See <a href="/numbers/6-5.htm" title="All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come on his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separates himself to the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.">Numbers 6:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-18.htm" title="And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.">Numbers 6:18</a>; Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell.

If it is urged that Aquila’s name placed after Priscilla’s indicates that he is the subject of the following verb, we have clearly seen that this is not the only occasion on which Priscilla’s name preceded her husband’s, see above, and <a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>, and <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>. The argument that the notice is intended by St. Luke to show that Paul counselled observance of the law, and did not tempt him to break it, as he was afterwards accused of doing, <a href="/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>, is still more irrelevant, for so far nothing has been definitely said as to Aquila’s conversion. And if the vow involved any obligation to appear at Jerusalem, it is quite evident that Paul and not Aquila went up to the Holy City. A list of the names on either side is given by Alford, Felten, Wendt. Amongst recent writers we may add Wendt, Zückler, Blass, Jüngst, Matthias as favouring the view that Aquila is the subject, whilst Weiss, Felton, Ramsay, Hort, Rendall, Page, Knabenbauer, Luckock take the opposite view. What then was the nature and occasion of the vow? Those who connect this vow with the journey to Jerusalem, as if the latter was obligatory in the fulfilment of the former, are justified in regarding the vow as a modified form of the Nazirite vow, <a href="/context/numbers/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. The man under the Nazirite vow was to drink no wine or strong drink, and to let no razor pass over his head or face. At the end of the time during which the vow lasted, his hair was shaven at the door of the Tabernacle (the Temple), and burnt in the fire of the altar as an offering. But it is to be observed that in this passage the word is <span class="greekheb">κειράμενος</span>, whilst of thus completing the Nazirite vow, <a href="/acts/21-24.htm" title="Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.">Acts 21:24</a>, the word <span class="greekheb">ξυρήσωνται</span> is used (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/11-6.htm" title="For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.">1 Corinthians 11:6</a>), and there is evidence (Wordsworth, <span class="ital">in loco</span>) that a man who had taken a Nazirite vow in a foreign land was allowed to poll or cut his hair shorter (<span class="greekheb">κείρω</span>), provided that the hair so polled was taken to the Temple and burnt there as an offering together with the hair shorn off at the completion of the vow. That the Jews took upon themselves a modified form of the Nazirite vow is proved from Josephus, <span class="ital">B. J.</span>, ii., 15, 1, when they were afflicted by disease or any other distress. Possibly therefore the vow followed upon St. Paul’s deliverance from an attack of sickness, and the warm praise bestowed upon Phœbe, the deaconess of the Church at Cenchreae (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>), for her personal aid to himself may be taken as some confirmation of this. But if we thus place St. Paul’s vow here under the category of the vows mentioned by Josephus, the journey to Jerusalem must be immediately connected with it, as the description given by the Jewish historian plainly shows that the vows in question were modified forms of the regular Nazirite vow. It is a very reasonable conjecture that the vow may be connected with St. Paul’s danger at Corinth, and with his safe deliverance from it. As one consecrated to the service of the Lord, he would allow his hair to grow until the promise of his safety had been fulfilled and his embarkation from Corinth was assured. The vow was thus analogous to the Nazirite vow, inasmuch as the same idea of consecration lay at the root of each; but it was rather a private vow (Hort, <span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 91, and Weiss, <span class="ital">in loco</span>), and in this case the journey of the Apostle to Jerusalem would not be conditioned by the vow, but by his desire to be present at some great festival, beyond doubt that of the Passover. On the custom amongst other nations to cut off the hair, and to let it grow in votive offering to the gods, see Holtzmann, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 395, and Page, <span class="ital">in loco</span>. Hilgenfeld ascribes the narrative of the incident to his “author to Theophilus,” whether the vow refers to Paul or Aquila, and considers that the story is intended to connect St. Paul as much as possible with Judaism. One of the most curious instances of perverse interpretation is that of Krenkel, who thinks that the <span class="greekheb">κειρ</span>. may be referred to Paul, who shaved his head to counteract the epileptic fits with which he was afflicted, <a href="/2_corinthians/13-7.htm" title="Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.">2 Corinthians 13:7</a>, see Zöckler’s note.—<span class="greekheb">Κεγχρεαῖς</span>, see notices of the place in Renan, <span class="ital">Saint Paul</span>, p. 218, and Hastings’ B.D., modern <span class="ital">Kalaniki</span> (in Thuc. <span class="greekheb">Κεγχρειαί</span>): the eastern harbour of Corinth, about nine miles distant, connecting the trade with Asia; Lechæum, the other port (“bimaris Corinthi,” Horace, <span class="ital">Odes</span>, i., 7, 2), connecting it with Italy and the West. <span class="greekheb">Τούτῳ μὲν οὖν χρῶνται πρὸς τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Ἀσίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Ἰταλίας τῷ Λεχαίῳ</span>, Strabo, viii., 6, p. 380.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[323]ccl. ecclesiastical.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[324]mpf. imperfect tense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18–23</span>.

This appears to be after the appearance before Gallio. We are told (<a href="/acts/18-11.htm" title="And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.">Acts 18:11</a>) that he settled quietly for a year and six months. Then came an opportunity of attacking him on Gallio’s arrival. Of this the Jews tried to avail themselves, and when their attempt was at an end, the Apostle had another time of peace among his converts. So that the whole stay in Corinth extended over more than a year and a half.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sailed thence into</span> (better, <span class="bld">for</span>) <span class="ital">Syria</span>] We have no motive given why the Apostle at this time sailed back. Some have suggested that he was carrying a contribution to the brethren in Jerusalem. It is clear that when the return was resolved on, he wished to reach Jerusalem as soon as possible, for he declined to tarry in Ephesus even though his preaching was more readily received there than by the Jews in many other places. It may have been the wish to fulfil his vow, which could only be brought to its conclusion by a visit to the temple in Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow</span>] We can observe all through the narrative of the Acts that St Paul, although the Apostle of the Gentiles, did not cease to regard the festivals and ceremonies of the Jews in things which did not militate against the Christian liberty. For some reason, either during sickness or in the midst of his conflict at Corinth, he had taken a vow upon himself of the nature of the Nazarite vows (<a href="/context/numbers/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 6:1-21</a>). This could only be brought to its fitting close by a journey to Jerusalem to offer up the hair, which it was a part of the vow, to leave uncut. At Jerusalem when the ceremony was completed the head was shaven (see <a href="/acts/21-24.htm" title="Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.">Acts 21:24</a>), but it seems to have been allowed to persons at a distance to cut the hair short and to bring that with them to the temple and offer it up when the rest was shaven. This appears to be what St Paul did at this time, at Cenchreæ, before starting on the voyage to Syria. The Greek word for “having shorn” stands in the original next to Aquila, and some have contended from this that it was he who had the vow, and cut his hair. They have pointed out also that the order of the names “Priscilla and Aquila” seems to have been adopted purposely to make this connexion of words possible. But the name of the wife stands before that of her husband in <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>; see also <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm" title="Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.">2 Timothy 4:19</a>; and may have been so placed because by her zeal she made herself a very conspicuous member of the Church wherever she lived. But it seems very unlikely that all this detail of a vow and its observance would be so prominently mentioned in connexion with Aquila, who played but a small part in St Luke’s history; while it is a most significant feature in the conduct of St Paul that he so oft conformed to Jewish observances.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἱκανὰς</span>, <span class="ital">several</span> days) until their minds became composed, and that he should not seem to have fled away.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποταξάμενος</span>, <span class="ital">having taken his leave of</span>) by word of mouth, at a public meeting.—<span class="greekheb">Συρίαν</span>, <span class="ital">Syria</span>) <a href="/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a> at the end (<span class="ital">Antioch</span> was in Syria).—<span class="greekheb">σὺν αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">with him</span>) A happy (blessed) retinue, as far as to Ephesus.—<span class="greekheb">Πρίσκιλλα</span>, <span class="ital">Priscilla</span>) The wife, as being the more approved, is put before the husband.—<span class="greekheb">κειράμενος</span>, <span class="ital">having shorn</span> [shaven]) As was customary in the case of a vow: ch. <a href="/acts/21-24.htm" title="Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.">Acts 21:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-18.htm" title="And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.">Numbers 6:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Κεγχρεαῖς</span>, <span class="ital">in Cenchrea</span>) After having left Corinth, he adopted a Jewish custom as to the head (shaving off the hair), when setting out to Jews. Paul devoted this journey to the Jews rather (than to the Gentiles): <a href="/acts/18-19.htm" title="And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.">Acts 18:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εὐχὴν</span>) This <span class="ital">vow</span>, whatever was its object, was not properly that of a Nazarite, but one akin to it. And Paul seems to have taken it up for this reason, in order that he might impose on himself the necessity of speedily accomplishing this journey to Jerusalem.

This is a somewhat peculiar use of the word, which occurs also in <a href="/luke/9-61.htm">Luke 9:61</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a> (see too <a href="/mark/6-46.htm">Mark 6:46</a>). It is used in the same sense in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11. 8:6). In a metaphorical sense it means" to renounce," "to bid adieu to" (<a href="/luke/14-23.htm">Luke 14:23</a>). Of the six times it occurs in the New Testament, four are in St. Luke's writings and one in St. Paul's. <span class="cmt_word">With him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchreae</span>, etc. There is great diversity of opinion as to whether it was St. Paul or Aquila who had the vow. Meyer thinks that the mention of Priscilla before Aquila, contrary to the order in ver. 2 and in ver. 26 (where, however, the R.T. reads "<span class="accented">Priscilla</span> and <span class="accented">Aquila</span>), is a clear indication that Luke meant the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., to refer to Aquila, not to St. Paul, and Howson takes the same view. But this is a very weak argument, refuted at once by <a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, as well as by the whole run of the passage, in which Paul is throughout the person spoken of; or, as Alford puts it, in the consecutive narrative from ver. 18 to ver. 25, there are <span class="accented">nine</span> aorist participles, of which eight apply to Paul, as the subject of the section, making it scarcely doubtful that the ninth applies to him likewise. Moreover, there is no conceivable reason why the vow should be mentioned if it was taken by Aquila, and, what is still more conclusive, the person who went to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Paul, must be the one who had the vow, not the person who stayed behind, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Aquila. In fact, nobody would ever have thought of making Aquila the subject if it were not for the thought that there is an incongruity with Paul's character in his making a vow of that kind. But we must take what we find in Scripture, and not force it to speak our own thoughts. As regards the nature of the vow, it is not quite clear what it was. It was not the simple Nazaritic vow described in <a href="/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18-21</a>; nor is the word here used by St. Luke (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) the one which is there and elsewhere employed by the LXX., and by St. Luke himself in <a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>, of that final shaving of the hair of the Nazarite for the purpose of offering it at the door of the tabernacle (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>). It seems rather to have been of the nature of that vow which Josephus speaks of as customary for persons in any affliction, viz. to make a vow that, for thirty days previous to that on which they intend to offer sacrifice, they will abstain from wine and will shave off (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) their hair, adding that Bernice was now at Jerusalem in order to perform such a vow ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 15:1). But it further appears, from certain passages in the Mishna, that, if any one had a Nazarite vow upon him outside the limits of the Holy Land, he could not fulfill such vow till he was come to the Holy Laud, to Jerusalem; but it was allowable in such case to cut his hair short (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and as some say to take it with him to Jerusalem, and there offer it at the same time that he offered his sacrifice and shaved his head (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). It would seem, therefore, that either in a severe illness or under some great danger (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>) St. Paul had made such a vow; that he had been unwilling to cut his hair short at Corinth, where he was thrown so much into the society of Greeks, and therefore did so at Cenchreae just before he embarked for Syria; and that he made all haste to reach Jerusalem in time for the Passover, that he might there accomplish his vow (see Bishop Wordsworth's note on Acts 18:18; and Farrar's ' Life of St. Paul,' 2. p. 2). His motives for the vow may have been partly those described on another occasion (<a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>), and partly his own Jewish feelings of piety showing themselves in the accustomed way. <span class="cmt_word">Cenchreae</span>.
