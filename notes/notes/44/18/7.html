The name Titus was, like Gaius or Gains, one of the commonest Roman names, and, if the reading be genuine, we may think of the epithet as added to distinguish the Titus of Corinth from his namesake. On the other hand, to state the evidence on both sides fairly, the Titus who appears in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.">2Corinthians 7:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.">2Corinthians 8:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a>, was obviously very closely connected with the Church of Corinth, and was not unlikely to be sent to Crete to exercise a mission analogous to that which he had been entrusted with at Corinth, and the combination of the names Timotheus and Justus, above referred to, as equally entitled to reverence, is more intelligible if we assume that the latter name belonged to Titus, and that both stood therefore in the same relation to St. Paul as disciples and friends. In any case the Justus who is here named was, like Titus, an uncircumcised Gentile, attending the synagogue as a proselyte of the gate. Up to this time apparently, St. Paul had been lodging in the house of a Jew, in some region of Corinth analogous to the Ghetto of modern Rome, in the hope of conciliating his brethren according to the flesh. Now, in sight of the wild frenzied fanatics, he goes into a house which they would have shrunk from entering, even though it was next door to the synagogue, and though the man who lived in it was a devout worshipper.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue....">Acts 18:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">He entered into a man’s house, named Justus </span>— A Gentile, but a worshipper of the true God: and he preached there, though probably he still lodged with Aquila.

The identification was adopted by Chrysostom and Grotius, and for a statement of the evidence on either side see Plumptre, <span class="ital">in loco</span>. It should be remembered that we have Barsabbas Justus, <a href="/acts/1-23.htm" title="And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.">Acts 1:23</a>, and Jesus Justus, <a href="/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.

The house of a proselyte may have been chosen because it offered easy access to those who wished to come, whether Greeks or Hebrews (see Chrysostom’s comment), but in Paul’s thus going into the house of a proselyte hard by the synagogue we may see how his spirit had been stirred. But further: this Titus Justus was evidently a Roman citizen, one of the <span class="ital">coloni</span> in Corinth, and thus St. Paul would gain access through him to the more educated class in the city, Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 256, and “Corinth,” Hastings’ B.D., i. 480.—<span class="greekheb">συνομοροῦσα</span>: there is no need to suppose that he left his lodgings with Aquila—this house became Paul’s place of meeting (so in Ephesus, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus....">Acts 19:9-10</a>); he had his own synagogue there (Blass); in classics simple verb <span class="greekheb">ὁμορέω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁμουρέω</span>; compound only found here; <span class="greekheb">συνόμορος</span>, Eccl[319] writers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[319]ccl. ecclesiastical.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">a certain man’s house, named Justus</span>] He used this house for the purposes of teaching and worship.

His house was therefore an appropriate place in which both Jews and Gentiles might meet, and to which Gentiles would be more ready to come than to that of a Jew by birth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whose house joined hard to the synagogue</span>] It is likely that St Paul, though he came no more to the synagogue at Corinth, chose not to betake himself far away, because he would be ready to receive any of his brethren who might change their feelings and come to him. But we can see how, while his near neighbourhood gave opportunity for this, the meetings of those who came to the synagogue with those who were going to the house of Justus, would be likely to cause bitterness, especially when the number of St Paul’s adherents began to increase, and a ruler of the synagogue was counted among them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.">Acts 18:7</a>.
