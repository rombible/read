St. Paul was known as a speaker, one who preached the <span class= "ital">word</span> of God, and with that, as distinct from acts, Gallio had nothing to do. The “names” were those which he had probably heard of at Rome, even before he came to Corinth. (See Note on <a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>.) Was a teacher whom both parties spoke of as Jesus the Nazarene entitled also to bear the name of Christos? In the emphasis laid on “your law” (literally, <span class= "ital">the law which affects you</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the judge intimates that he sees through their appeal to law. It is Jewish, and not Roman law, which they are seeking to vindicate, and he will not make himself, as Pilate, after a weak protest (<a href="/john/18-3.htm" title="Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.">John 18:3</a>), had done (Gallio may well have known the history), the executioner of an alien code. With a strong emphasis on the pronoun, he ends with, “I, for my part, have no wish to be a judge of these things.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:12-17 Paul was about to show that he did not teach men to worship God contrary to law; but the judge would not allow the Jews to complain to him of what was not within his office. It was right in Gallio that he left the Jews to themselves in matters relating to their religion, but yet would not let them, under pretence of that, persecute another. But it was wrong to speak slightly of a law and religion which he might have known to be of God, and which he ought to have acquainted himself with. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus be the Messiah, and whether the gospel be a Divine revelation, are not questions of words and names, they are questions of vast importance. Gallio spoke as if he boasted of his ignorance of the Scriptures, as if the law of God was beneath his notice. Gallio cared for none of these things. If he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it was commendable; but if he concerned not himself for the abuses done to good men, his indifference was carried too far. And those who see and hear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no feeling with them, or care for them, who do not pity and pray for them, are of the same spirit as Gallio, who cared for none of these things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of words - A dispute about words, for such he would regard all their controversies about religion to be.<p>And names - Probably he had heard something of the nature of the controversy, and understood it to be a dispute about names; that is, whether Jesus was to be called the Messiah or not.

Dei</span>, vi., 10). The decision shows no favourable inclination to Christianity itself, but this does not take away from its importance as proving that so far as the Roman authorities were concerned the freedom of speech thus granted would enable the religion of the Christ to make its way through the civilised, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Roman world; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 260, who sees in his residence at Corinth an epoch in Paul’s life not only as regards his doctrine and his presentation of it but also as regards his aim that Christianity should be spread throughout the empire, an aim made more clear by the imperial policy of which Gallio was the exponent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[321] R(omana), in Blass, a first rough copy of St. Luke.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[322] Augustine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">But if</span> <span class="bld">they are questions about</span> <span class="ital">words and names</span>] The oldest authorities give the plural “questions,” and there would no doubt have been many points brought forward from St Paul’s teaching to which the Jews would object. And whether Jesus was the Christ or not would seem to the Roman a matter entirely of definition, and on which the law had no bearing. If he had heard the name of “Christus” at Rome, it would make Gallio the more ready to imitate his royal master, and get rid of the disputants as fast and as far as possible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and of your law</span>] Better, <span class="ital">and of</span> <span class="bld">your own</span> <span class="ital">law</span>.

But Gallio sees through their intention, and counting them all for Jews, he will not be drawn into their questions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">look ye to it</span>] Better, <span class="ital">look to it</span> <span class="bld">yourselves</span> (as <span class="ital">R.

It is not a case where his jurisdiction can interfere, and so he leaves the whole untouched. There is no question here about his own regard and disregard of enquiries about religion. He sits to administer Roman law, and this dispute among the Jews at Corinth lies outside his cognizance altogether.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/18-15.htm" title="But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.">Acts 18:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ</span>, <span class="ital">if</span>) Gallio speaks slightingly (contemptuously): as presently, in the word <span class="greekheb">τούτων</span>, <span class="ital">of such</span> matters.—<span class="greekheb">ζήτημα</span>) Such men do not like <span class="ital">questions</span>: ch. <a href="/acts/23-29.htm" title="Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.">Acts 23:29</a>, CI.
