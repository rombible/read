See the notes on <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>.<p>No man shall set on thee - No one who shall rise up against thee will be able to hurt thee. His life was in God's hands, and he would preserve him in order that his people might be collected into the church.<p>For I have - Greek: there is to me; that is, I possess, or there belongs to me.<p>Much people - Many who should be regarded as his true friends, and who should be saved.<p>In this city - In that very city that was so voluptuous, so rich, so effeminate, and where there had been already so decided opposition shown to the gospel. This passage evidently means that God had a design or purpose to save many of that people, for it was given to Paul as an encouragement to him to labor there, evidently meaning that God would grant him success in his work. It cannot mean that the Lord meant to say that the great mass of the people, or that the moral and virtuous part, if there were any such, was then regarded as his people; but that he intended to convert many of those guilty and profligate Corinthians to himself, and to gather a people for his own service there. We may learn from this:<p>(1) That God has a purpose in regard to the salvation of sinners.<p>(2) that that purpose is so fixed in the mind of God that he can say that those in relation to whom it is formed are his.<p>(3) this is the ground of encouragement to the ministers of the gospel. Had God no purpose to save sinners, they could have no hope in their work.<p>(4) this plan may have reference to the most frivolous, the most guilty, and the most abandoned, and ministers should not be deterred by the amount or the degree of wickedness from attempting to save them.<p>(5) there may be more hope of success among a dissolute and profligate population, than among proud, cold, and skeptical philosophers. Paul had little success in philosophic Athens; he had great success in dissolute Corinth. There is often more hope of converting a man openly dissolute and abandoned, than one who prides himself on his philosophy, and is confident in his own wisdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

According to his promise, <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a> not only to assist in the ministry of the word, to give light into it, and liberty to preach it, and success in it, but to keep and preserve him from being hurt by men: <p>and no man shall set on thee; attack thee, or lay hands on thee: <p>to hurt thee; to do any injury to thy person, to thy body, in any part of it: wicked men cannot strike a blow, or do the least damage to a servant of Christ without his permission; he can tie their hands, and restrain their rage. <p>For I have much people in this city; this wicked and luxurious city; there were many here who were yet in their sins, in a state of unregeneracy, whom God had chosen to be his people, and had taken into his covenant as such; were given to Christ as his peculiar people, and whom he had redeemed with his precious blood: they were his people both by gift and purchase, before they were called by grace; and because of this his interest in them, he will have his Gospel continued for the gathering them in to himself; for Christ will lose none of his, all shall come unto him: from all which it appears, that Christ has a people who are related to him, and he has an interest in, before they are effectually called by grace; for this refers not to the many Corinthians who had heard and believed, and were baptized, but to some that had not, and were yet to be called; not the Jews in this city, Christ's own nation, nor all the inhabitants of it who were in some sense Christ's people, being made and supported in their beings by him, are intended; but a special people among the Gentiles, the same with the other sheep Christ speaks of, <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a> not yet of his fold; a people beloved of God, chosen in Christ, given to him, and with whom a covenant was made in him, for whom Christ undertook, in whose name he acted, and for whom he received blessings and promises, as well as took the care and charge of their persons; for the sake of these he assumed human nature, and suffered and died; towards these his heart always is; his eye is upon them, and he knows them, and where they are; and therefore he will look them up and find them out, and they shall be brought to believe in him, and shall not perish, but have everlasting life: and it may be further observed, that Christ has "many" such, though they are but comparatively few, yet in themselves they are a great number; yea, he has sometimes many of these in the worst of places, and among the vilest of men; and for the sake of these, in order to select and separate them from the rest, is the Gospel preached and continued. The ministers of it are sent here and there, where such persons are, and there they are continued till they are gathered in; yea, on this account both the Gospel and its preachers are continued in the world; and even the world itself, for the sake of these, till they are brought in, and then it will be destroyed; and it may be also remarked, that for the encouragement of Gospel ministers, Christ promises his presence and protection, and which was fulfilled in the Apostle Paul at Corinth; who though he stayed there a year and six months, none were suffered to do him any injury; and when an insurrection was made within that time, yet the apostle escaped, and quietly departed elsewhere. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/18.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/18-10.htm" title="For I am with you, and no man shall set on you to hurt you: for I have much people in this city.">Acts 18:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">διότι ἐγώ</span>: <span class="ital">fundamentum fiduciæ</span>, Bengel.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιθ</span>.: only here in this sense, but so in LXX, <span class="ital">aggrediri, cf.</span> <a href="/genesis/43-18.htm" title="And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall on us, and take us for slaves, and our asses.">Genesis 43:18</a>, <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm" title="But if a man come presumptuously on his neighbor, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.">Exodus 21:14</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/23-13.htm" title="And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise.
