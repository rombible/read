At Corinth, as the Syriac version, and some copies, read; he was obedient to the heavenly vision: in the Greek text it is, "he sat" there, answerable to the Hebrew word  which signifies to sit, continue and abide: he stayed there in all a year and six months; which was a long time for the apostle to stay in one place, and longer than he did anywhere, unless at Ephesus, where he continued two years, <a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a> for as for his stay at Rome, that was by confinement: but here were many people to be called, and much work to do, a large church to be raised, and put in order; and this required time as well as care and labour: <p>teaching the word of God among them; he did not sit idle here, but preached the Gospel, which is the word of God, and not man, openly and publicly, among them all; and that frequently, in season and out of season, and with great boldness and faithfulness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> continued <i>there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span><p>(e) Literally, sat, whereupon they in former time took the name of their bishop's seat: but Paul sat, that is, continued teaching the word of God: and this type of seat does not belong to those who never took their seats with a mind to teach in them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/18.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/18-11.htm" title="And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.">Acts 18:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισε</span>, see critical note, “he dwelt,” R.V., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/24-49.htm" title="And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.">Luke 24:49</a>, but not elsewhere in N.T. in this sense, but constantly in LXX, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-1.htm" title="In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin.">1Ma 2:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-29.htm" title="Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down into the wilderness, to dwell there:">1Ma 2:29</a>.

The word may be purposely used here instead of the ordinary <span class="greekheb">μένειν</span> to indicate the quiet and settled work to which the Apostle was directed by the vision which had calmed his troubled spirit, and had taught him that his cherished plan of revisiting Macedonia must be postponed to preaching the Word in Corinth.

In this period the Apostle would have founded the Church at Cenchreae, and his labours seem to have extended still further, for in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2 Corinthians 1:1</a> we read of the saints in the whole of Achaia (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.">2 Corinthians 11:10</a>) and the household of Stephanas is spoken of as the firstfruits not of Corinth but of Achaia.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">And he continued</span> [<span class="bld">dwelt</span>] <span class="ital">there</span>] In these words the historian seems to be expressing the content which pervaded the Apostle’s mind after the vision. Neither the A. V. nor the Revised rendering gives to the full the meaning of the Greek. The verb is generally rendered “to sit down,” and here seems to be applied purposely to the restful state of the Apostle’s mind after the comforting revelation. The same verb is used by St Luke (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm" title="And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.">Luke 24:49</a>), “<span class="ital">Tarry</span> ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high,” where the admonition is of like character with the advice given here to St Paul.

It is not clear whether these eighteen months are to be measured to the end of St. Paul's stay at Corinth, or only to the rising up of the Jews related in vers. 12-17. Renan is doubtful. Howson does not go into the question. But Lewin rightly measures the eighteen months down to Gallio's arrival.
