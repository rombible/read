To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherein ... - This particular vision was suggested by Peter's hunger, <a href="/acts/10-10.htm">Acts 10:10</a>. It was designed, however, to teach him an important lesson in regard to the introduction of all nations to the gospel. Its descending from heaven may have been an intimation that that religion which was about to abolish the distinction between the Jews and other nations was of divine origin.

Not as if they were painted upon it, and these were only pictures and representations of them made on the linen sheet; but as if they really add actually were upon it alive; since Peter is afterwards called upon to kill and eat: and these design four-footed beasts of every kind, that are tame, as distinct from the wild ones, after mentioned, as horses, camels, oxen, sheep, hogs, dogs, &amp;c. <p>and wild beasts; lions, tigers, panthers, bears, &amp;c. This clause is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions: <p>and creeping things; the above copy and versions here add, "of the earth", which they omit in the first clause; these intend serpents, snakes, worms, &amp;c: <p>and fowls of the air; birds of all sorts: now the whole of this signifies, that the church of Christ, under the Gospel dispensation, consists of all sorts of persons, of all nations, Jews and Gentiles, the one being reckoned clean, the other unclean; of men of all sorts of tempers and dispositions, comparable to wild or tame beasts; and of all sorts of sinners, who before conversion have been greater or lesser sinners; as well as denotes that the distinction of food under the ceremonial law was now ceased. This is not designed to represent that there are good and bad in Gospel churches, as there certainly are and much less that immoral persons are to be received and retained there; but that those who have been of the blackest character, if called by grace, should be admitted into them; and chiefly to show that Gentiles reckoned unclean, when converted, are not to be rejected. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherein were <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> all manner of <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> creeping things, and fowls of the air.</span><p>(h) Here is this word all which is general, plainly used for something indefinite and uncertain, that is to say, for some of all sorts, not for all of every sort.<p>(i) That is, such as were proper for men's use.<p>(k) To see what is meant by these creeping things see Le 11:2-47.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/10-12.htm" title="Wherein were all manner of four footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.">Acts 10:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">τετράποδα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: fish are not mentioned, perhaps because the vessel was not represented as containing water (so Blass, Weiss, Wendt), although fish also were divided into clean and unclean, <a href="/leviticus/11-9.htm" title="These shall you eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall you eat.">Leviticus 11:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/14-9.htm" title="These you shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall you eat:">Deuteronomy 14:9</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">wherein were</span>] i.e. appeared to be in the vision.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts</span>] The oldest MSS. omit the last six words.
