Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commanded of God to say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Four days ago - See the notes on <a href="/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a>.<p>Until this hour - The ninth hour, or three o'clock, p. m.
