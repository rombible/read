That had purified them from whatever taint had adhered to them under the precepts of the Law. In the interpretation of the vision, all that belongs to humanity had been taken up into heaven; first, when man’s nature was assumed by the Eternal Word in the Incarnation (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), and, secondly, when that nature had been raised in the Ascension to the heaven of heavens, sitting on the right hand of God (<a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a><span class= "ital">;</span> <a href="/mark/16-19.htm" title="So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.">Mark 16:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common....">Acts 10:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the voice spake the second time </span>— When God commands a strange, or seemingly improper thing, the first objection frequently finds pardon. But it ought not to be repeated. This doubt and delay of Peter, however, had several good effects. Hereby the will of God, on this important point, was made more evident and incontestable. And Peter also, having been so slow of belief himself, could the more easily bear the doubting of his brethren, <a href="/acts/11-2.htm" title="And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,">Acts 11:2</a>. <span class="ital">What God hath cleansed </span>— By such a declaration of his will, in commanding thee to eat them; <span class="ital">that call not thou common </span>— But readily submit thyself to his directions, acknowledging the power of the great Lawgiver to change his precepts as he shall see fit. <span class="ital">This was done thrice </span>— To make the deeper impression on Peter’s mind.

To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What God hath cleansed - What God has pronounced or declared pure. If God has commanded you to do a thing, it is not impure or wrong. Perhaps Peter would suppose that the design of this vision was to instruct him that the distinction between clean and unclean food, as recognized by the Jews, was about to be abolished, <a href="/acts/10-17.htm">Acts 10:17</a>. But the result showed that it had a higher and more important design. It was to show him that they who had been esteemed by the Jews as unclean or profane - the entire Gentile world - might now be admitted to similar privileges with the Jews. That barrier was robe broken down, and the whole world was to be admitted to the same fellowship and privileges in the gospel. See <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>. It was also true that the ceremonial laws of the Jews in regard to clean and unclean beasts was to pass away, though this was not directly taught in this vision. But when once the barrier was removed that separated the Jews and Gentiles, all the laws which were founded on such a distinction, and which were framed to keep up such a distinction, passed away of course. The ceremonial laws of the Jews were designed solely to keep up the distinction between them and other nations. When the distinction was abolished; when other nations were to be admitted to the same privileges, the laws which were made to keep up such a difference received their death-blow, and expired of course. For it is a maxim of all law, that when the reason why a law was made ceases to exist, the law becomes obsolete. Yet it was not easy to convince the Jews that their laws ceased to be binding. This point the apostles labored to establish; and from this point arose most of the difficulties between the Jewish and Gentile converts to Christianity.

Distinctions both of men and meats were now to be laid aside; and the Jews themselves own, that what is now unclean, will be clean in the time to come, or the times of the Messiah; they say (f), <p>"every beast which is unclean in this world,  <p>the holy blessed God ,  <p>cleanses it, in the time to come, (the times of the Messiah,) as they were at first clean to the sons of Noah <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>, wherefore, as the herb was clean to all, and as the beasts were clean to the sons of Noah; so also in the time to come he will loose what he has bound, or forbidden.'' <p>And particularly they observe, that a swine is call from  "to return", because the Lord will return it unto Israel.
