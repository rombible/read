It is obvious that it might in part be the natural consequence of the protracted fast, and the intense prayer, possibly also of exposure under such conditions to the noontide sun. The state was one in which the normal action of the senses was suspended, like that of Balaam in <a href="/numbers/24-4.htm" title="He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:">Numbers 24:4</a>, or that which St. Paul describes in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;)">2Corinthians 12:3</a>, “whether in the body or out of the body” he cannot tell, and, as such, it was, in this instance, made the channel for a revelation of the Divine Will conveyed in symbols which were adapted to the conditions out of which it rose.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:9-18 The prejudices of Peter against the Gentiles, would have prevented his going to Cornelius, unless the Lord had prepared him for this service. To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he became very hungry - Prom the connection, where it is said that they were making ready, that is, preparing a meal, it would seem that this was the customary hour of dining. The Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans, however, had but two meals, and the first was usually taken about ten or eleven o'clock. This meal usually consisted of fruit, milk, cheese, etc. Their principal meal was about six or seven in the afternoon, at which time they observed their feasts. See Jahn's Bible. Archaeol. section 145.<p>He fell into a trance - Greek: an ecstasy, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  ekstasis, fell upon him. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-5.htm">Acts 11:5</a>, Peter says that in a trance he saw a vision. The word "trance, or ecstasy," denotes "a state of mind when the attention is absorbed in a particular train of thought, so that the external senses are partially or entirely suspended." It is a high species of abstraction from external objects, when the mind becomes forgetful of surrounding things, and is fixed solely on its own thoughts, so that appeals to the external senses do not readily rouse it. The soul seems to have passed out of the body, and to be conversant only with spiritual essences. Thus, Balaam is said to have seen the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4</a>, <a href="/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>; thus Paul, in praying in the temple, fell into a trance <a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>; and perhaps a similar state is described in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>. This effect seems to be caused by so intense and absorbing a train of thought as to overcome the senses of the body, or wholly to withdraw the mind from their influence, and to fix it on the unseen object that engrosses it. It is often a high state of reverie, or absence of mind, which Dr. Rush describes as "induced by the stimulus of ideas of absent subjects, being so powerful as to destroy the perception of present objects" (Diseases of the Mind, p. 310, ed. Philadelphia, 1812). In the case of Peter, however, there was a supernatural influence that drew his attention away from present objects. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. a trance&#8212;differing from the "vision" of Cornelius, in so far as the things seen had not the same objective reality, though both were supernatural.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He became very hungry; </span> he might be more than ordinarily hungry, to fit or suit the vision, which is hereafter mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He fell into a trance:</span> the most excellent way of God’s manifesting himself unto man, is by a trance; (and they reckon seven ways, in which God makes himself known unto man); but what this trance was is diversly expressed: it is certain. that in it the soul was, as it were. absent from the body, drawn off from the perception of earthly and sensible things, and enabled unto the perception of heavenly mysteries: in such an ecstasy was St. Paul, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a></span>, and St. John, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a></span>, who is therefore said to be <span class="ital">in the Spirit.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he became very hungry,....
