The fear of God and works of righteousness are the substance of true religion, the effects of special grace. Though these are not the cause of a man's acceptance, yet they show it; and whatever may be wanting in knowledge or faith, will in due time be given by Him who has begun it. They knew in general the word, that is, the gospel, which God sent to the children of Israel. The purport of this word was, that God by it published the good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ. They knew the several matters of fact relating to the gospel. They knew the baptism of repentance which John preached. Let them know that this Jesus Christ, by whom peace is made between God and man, is Lord of all; not only as over all, God blessed for evermore, but as Mediator. All power, both in heaven and in earth, is put into his hand, and all judgment committed to him. God will go with those whom he anoints; he will be with those to whom he has given his Spirit. Peter then declares Christ's resurrection from the dead, and the proofs of it. Faith has reference to a testimony, and the Christian faith is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, on the testimony given by them. See what must be believed concerning him. That we are all accountable to Christ as our Judge; so every one must seek his favour, and to have him as our Friend. And if we believe in him, we shall all be justified by him as our Righteousness. The remission of sins lays a foundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out of the way which hinders the bestowing of them. If sin be pardoned, all is well, and shall end well for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Showed him openly - Manifestly; so that there could be no deception, no doubt of his resurrection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-41. showed him openly; Not to all the people&#8212;for it was not fitting that He should subject Himself, in His risen condition, to a second rejection in Person.<p>but unto witnesses chosen before of God &#8230; to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose, &c.&#8212;Not the less certain, therefore, was the fact of His resurrection, though withholding Himself from general gaze in His risen body.<p>he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead&#8212;He had before proclaimed Him "Lord of all," for the dispensing of "peace" to all alike; now he announces Him in the same supreme lordship, for the exercise of judgment upon all alike. On this divine ordination, see Joh 5:22, 23, 27; Ac 17:31. Thus we have here all Gospel truth in brief.
