The fear of God and works of righteousness are the substance of true religion, the effects of special grace. Though these are not the cause of a man's acceptance, yet they show it; and whatever may be wanting in knowledge or faith, will in due time be given by Him who has begun it. They knew in general the word, that is, the gospel, which God sent to the children of Israel. The purport of this word was, that God by it published the good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ. They knew the several matters of fact relating to the gospel. They knew the baptism of repentance which John preached. Let them know that this Jesus Christ, by whom peace is made between God and man, is Lord of all; not only as over all, God blessed for evermore, but as Mediator. All power, both in heaven and in earth, is put into his hand, and all judgment committed to him. God will go with those whom he anoints; he will be with those to whom he has given his Spirit. Peter then declares Christ's resurrection from the dead, and the proofs of it. Faith has reference to a testimony, and the Christian faith is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, on the testimony given by them. See what must be believed concerning him. That we are all accountable to Christ as our Judge; so every one must seek his favour, and to have him as our Friend. And if we believe in him, we shall all be justified by him as our Righteousness. The remission of sins lays a foundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out of the way which hinders the bestowing of them. If sin be pardoned, all is well, and shall end well for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word - That is, this is the Word, or "the doctrine." Few passages in the New Testament have perplexed critics more than this. It has been difficult to ascertain to what the term "word" in the accusative case &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  ton logon  here refers. Our translation would lead us to suppose that it is synonymous with what is said in the following verse. But it should be remarked that the term used there, and translated "word," as if it were a repetition of what is said here, is a different term. It is not &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  logon, but &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  re&#772;ma - a word, a thing; not a doctrine. I understand the first term "word" to be an introduction of the doctrine which Peter set forth, and to be governed by a preposition understood. The whole passage may be thus expressed: Peter had been asked to teach Cornelius and his assembled friends. It was expected, of course, that he would instruct him in regard to the true doctrines of religion - the doctrine which had been communicated to the Jews. He commences, therefore, with a statement respecting the true doctrine of the Messiah, or the way of salvation which was now made known to the Jews. "In regard to the Word, or the doctrine which God sent to the children of Israel, proclaiming peace through Jesus Christ (who is Lord of all), you know already what was done, or the transactions which occurred throughout all Judea, from Galilee, where he commenced his ministry after John had preached, that this was by Jesus Christ, since God had anointed him," etc. Peter here assumes that Cornelius had some knowledge of the principal events of the life of the Saviour, though it was obscure and imperfect; and his discourse professes only to state this more fully and clearly.<p>Unto the children of Israel - To the Jews. The Messiah was promised to them, and spent his life among them.<p>Preaching - That is, proclaiming, or announcing. God did this by Jesus Christ.<p>Peace - This word sometimes refers to the peace or union which was made between Jews and Gentiles, by breaking down the wall of division between them. But it is used here in a wider sense, to denote "peace or reconciliation with God." He announced the way by which man might be reconciled to God, and might find peace.<p>He is Lord of all - That is, Jesus Christ. He is sovereign, or ruler of both Jews and Gentiles, and hence, Peter saw the propriety of preaching the gospel to one as to the other. See <a href="/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>. The word "Lord" used here does not necessarily imply divinity, but only that the Lord Jesus, as Mediator, had been constituted or appointed Lord or Ruler over all nations. It is true, however, that this is a power which we cannot conceive to have been delegated to one that was not divine.

Now the apostle enters on his sermon or discourse, of which the above were only a preface, or an introduction; and his sense is, that the doctrine which he was now about to preach to them, was the doctrine of the Gospel; which it pleased God, of his infinite wisdom and rich grace, to send first to the people of the Jews, by the ministry of the apostles: this word is sometimes called the word of God, of which he is the author; and the word of Christ, of which he is the sum and substance; and the word of salvation, salvation by Christ alone being the principal part of it; and the word of righteousness, because therein is the righteousness of Christ revealed, from faith to faith; and the word of faith itself, because it is the means by which faith comes; and the word of truth, because it contains nothing but truth; and sometimes, the word of reconciliation, because it publishes peace and reconciliation by Christ, as is hereafter signified: this word God is said to send; which shows that it comes from him, and is of a divine original, and therefore ought to be received, not as the word of man, but as: the word of God; and it may be said to be "sent", because the apostles were sent with it by Christ; who ordained them, and sent them forth to preach it in the several cities of Judea; and which shows that Christ is God, who sent this word by them, and so the text is a proof of his deity; and this was sent to the children of Israel and to them only at first; the apostles were forbidden going in the way of the Gentiles, or entering into any of the cities of the Samaritans; and though their commission was now enlarged, and they might go to the Gentiles, as yet they had not done it, only published the Gospel to the Jews: the substance of which was, <p>preaching peace by Jesus Christ: that word preached, or the apostles in the ministry of it preached; or rather God, who sent the word by them, preached through them the doctrine of peace and reconciliation, by the blood of Christ; and this being so principal a doctrine of the Gospel, the whole is called from it, the Gospel of peace, and the word of reconciliation: by "peace" here is meant, not peace with the creatures of the earth, the beasts of the field, which, through the sin of men, are become troublesome to them; nor peace with men, which is desirable, and to be sought after, and to a good man the Lord makes his enemies to be at peace with him; nor peace with the saints, which ought by all means to be maintained, and which should rule in the hearts of God's people, and to which the Gospel calls them; but peace with God, which was broken by the sin of man, which filled his mind with enmity to God; and now he is incapable of restoring it, and reconciling himself to God; he has neither disposition, nor ability to perform it; but Christ is the sole author of it: a council of peace was held, in which the scheme of it was drawn; a covenant of peace was entered into, between the Father and the Son; Christ was provided, promised, and prophesied of, as the peace maker; he came into the world for this purpose; the chastisement of our peace was laid on him, and he procured it by his obedience, sufferings; and death: and this is what the Gospel publishes; not peace made by men, by their repentance, humiliation, and works of righteousness; but made by Christ, the Prince of peace, by his blood and sacrifice: and not as to be made by him, or any other, but as already made; being not only a plan drawn, but executed, a finished work; and that not conditionally, if men will repent, believe, and obey, but absolutely, as a thing done, and not dependent on any condition required of man; and a wonderful blessing this is, being made on honourable terms, and so lasting, and bringing with it a train of other blessings; and this being an article in the Gospel, makes that to be good news, and glad tidings indeed: and these doctrines of peace with God by the blood of Christ, and reconciliation for sin by his sacrifice, were to be preached to them that were afar off, and to them that are nigh, both to the Jews and Gentiles; to strengthen which observation, the following clause put into a parenthesis is added, <p>he is Lord of all: of the whole world, and all things in it; of all the nations of the world, Gentiles as well as Jews, and particularly of God's elect among them both; and therefore he will have the Gospel preached to one, as to another; <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> word which <i>God</i> sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</span><p>(p) God showed the Israelites that whoever lives godly is acceptable to God, no matter what nation he comes from, for he preached peace to men through Jesus Christ, who is Lord not only of one nation, that is, of the Jews, but of all.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/acts/10-36.htm" title="The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)...">Acts 10:36-38</a>.

Schmid, Homberg, Wolf, Heumann, Beck (<span class="ital">Obss. crit. exeg.</span>, I. p. 13), Heinrichs, Kuinoel make the connection almost as we have given it; but they attach <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς οἴδατε</span> to <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον</span>, and take to <span class="greekheb">τὸ γενόμενον ῥῆμα</span> as apposition to <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον</span>,—by which, however, <span class="greekheb">οὗτός ἐστι πάντων κύριος</span> makes its weight, in keeping with the connection, far less sensibly felt than according to our view, under which it by the very fact of its high significance as an element breaks off the construction. Others refer <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον ὃν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. to <span class="ital">what precedes</span>, in which case, however, it cannot be taken either as for <span class="greekheb">ὃν λόγον</span> (Beza, Grotius; comp. Bengel and others), or with Olshausen, after Calvin and others, for <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν λόγον ὃν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; but would have, with de Wette (comp. Baumgarten and Lange), to be made dependent on <span class="greekheb">καταλαμβ</span>., or to be regarded as an appositional addition (Buttm. <span class="ital">neut. Gr.</span> p. 134 [E. T. 153]), and consequently would be epexegetical of <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι</span> … <span class="greekheb">δεκτὸς αὐτῷ ἐστι</span>. In this case <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span> would have to be understood of <span class="ital">peace between Jews and Gentiles</span>. But even apart from this inadmissible explanation of <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνην</span> (see below), the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> of <a href="/acts/10-36.htm" title="The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)">Acts 10:36</a>, so far as it proclaims this peace, is something very different from the doctrine indicated in <a href="/acts/10-35.htm" title="But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him.">Acts 10:35</a>, in which there is expressed only the universally requisite <span class="ital">first step</span> towards Christianity. Moreover, Peter could not yet <span class="ital">at this time</span> say that God had caused that peace to be proclaimed through Christ (for this he required a further development starting from his present experience), for which a reference to <a href="/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a> and to the universalism of Luke’s Gospel by no means suffices.

But this is linguistically incorrect, inasmuch as it would require at least the infinitive instead of <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελιζόμενος</span>; and besides, <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζομαί τι</span>, <span class="ital">there is something proclaimed to me</span>, is foreign to the N.
