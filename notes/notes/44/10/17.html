To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doubted in himself - Doubted in his own mind. He was perplexed, and did not know how to understand it.<p>Behold, the men ... - We see here an admirable arrangement of the events of Providence to fit each other. Every part of this transaction is made to harmonize with every other part; and it was so arranged that just in the moment when the mind of Peter was filled with perplexity, the very event should occur which would relieve him of his embarrassment. Such a coincidence is not uncommon. An event of divine Providence may be as clear an expression of his will, and may as certainly serve to indicate our duty, as the most manifest revelation would do, and a state of mind may, by an arrangement of circumstances, be produced that will be extremely perplexing until some event shall occur, or some field of usefulness shall open, that will exactly correspond to it, and indicate to us the will of God. We should then carefully mark the events of God's providence. We should observe and record the train of our own thoughts, and should watch with interest any event that occurs, when we are perplexed and embarrassed, to obtain, if possible, an expression of the will of God.<p>Before the gate - The word here rendered "gate," &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  pulo&#772;na refers properly to the porch or principal entrance to an Eastern house.
