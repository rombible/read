Their crucifying Christ is here spoken of, the rather, to show how justly the Jews were now to be abandoned of God, and that they had no cause to complain of their rejection and the calling of the Gentiles, seeing that they had in such a manner rejected Christ. <span class="ital">Him </span>— This very same person, though so injuriously treated by men; <span class="ital">God raised up the third day </span>— According to the repeated predictions of the prophets. Peter thus preaches unto them the resurrection which immediately followed his crucifixion, lest the Gentiles should be deterred from believing in him, and should take offence at the scandal of the cross. <span class="ital">And showed him openly </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εδωκεν αυτον εμφανη γενεσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">gave him to become manifest, </span>namely, after his resurrection; and evidently to appear. As if he had said, That he rose is unquestionable, it having been evidenced in all the ways by which any thing can be proved. For Christ was seen, and heard, and felt by many after his resurrection; he appeared <span class="ital">not </span>now indeed <span class="ital">to all the people </span>— As before his death; <span class="ital">but unto witnesses </span>— Persons appointed to be witnesses of this fact; <span class="ital">chosen before of God </span>— For this purpose; <span class="ital">even to us, who did eat and drink </span>— And converse frequently and familiarly <span class="ital">with him, after he arose from the dead </span>— As we had done during the time of his ministry; so that we can, and do, with the greatest certainty, bear witness to the truth of these important matters. <span class="ital">And he commanded us </span>— Gave it us in charge in a most solemn manner; <span class="ital">to preach unto the people </span>— The glad tidings of salvation, present and eternal; <span class="ital">and to testify </span>— Wherever we come; <span class="ital">that it is he </span>— This very Jesus of Nazareth; who is <span class="ital">ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead </span>— That is, of all mankind, whether they be alive at his coming, or had died before it.

The fear of God and works of righteousness are the substance of true religion, the effects of special grace. Though these are not the cause of a man's acceptance, yet they show it; and whatever may be wanting in knowledge or faith, will in due time be given by Him who has begun it. They knew in general the word, that is, the gospel, which God sent to the children of Israel. The purport of this word was, that God by it published the good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ. They knew the several matters of fact relating to the gospel. They knew the baptism of repentance which John preached. Let them know that this Jesus Christ, by whom peace is made between God and man, is Lord of all; not only as over all, God blessed for evermore, but as Mediator. All power, both in heaven and in earth, is put into his hand, and all judgment committed to him. God will go with those whom he anoints; he will be with those to whom he has given his Spirit. Peter then declares Christ's resurrection from the dead, and the proofs of it. Faith has reference to a testimony, and the Christian faith is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, on the testimony given by them. See what must be believed concerning him. That we are all accountable to Christ as our Judge; so every one must seek his favour, and to have him as our Friend. And if we believe in him, we shall all be justified by him as our Righteousness. The remission of sins lays a foundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out of the way which hinders the bestowing of them. If sin be pardoned, all is well, and shall end well for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And we are witnesses - We who are apostles.
