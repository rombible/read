He did not bid them go to an inn, and refresh or repose themselves at their own charge, but was himself at the charge of entertaining them at his own quarters. He lodged them, though they were Gentiles, to show how readily he complied with the design of the vision, in eating with Gentiles. And, though they were two of them servants, and the other a common soldier, yet Peter thought it not below him to take them into his house. <span class="ital">And on the morrow went away with them </span>— Not delaying to obey the heavenly vision. <span class="ital">And certain brethren — </span>Namely, six in number, <a href="/acts/11-12.htm" title="And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.

How pleasing a mixture have we here, of prudence and humility! Sufficient to “teach us, on all proper occasions, to express at once a becoming deference to our brethren, and prudent caution in our own best intended actions; that even <span class="ital">our good may not be evil spoken of, </span>when it lies in our power to prevent it.” See Doddridge, and <a href="/romans/14-16.htm" title="Let not then your good be evil spoken of:">Romans 14:16</a>. <span class="ital">And </span>on <span class="ital">the morrow after they entered into Cesarea </span>— Though it is probable they travelled on foot, yet as Joppa was only about fifteen leagues distant from Cesarea, they might easily arrive there the day after that on which they set out. <span class="ital">And Cornelius waited for them </span>— Not engaging himself in any secular business during that solemn time, but being altogether intent on this thing. <span class="ital">And he called together his kinsmen </span>— His relations; <span class="ital">and near friends </span>— Those with whom he was most intimate, and had the greatest love to. This, he thought, he could not better express, than by giving them an opportunity to hear the word of life, and to gain instruction for their souls. And, probably, those here spoken of were accounted near friends by Cornelius; because they were such as had forsaken all pagan idolatry, and were, with him, worshippers of the true and living God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:19-33 When we see our call clear to any service, we should not be perplexed with doubts and scruples arising from prejudices or former ideas. Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God!
