We can, in some measure, enter into the feelings which filled the Apostle’s mind, through what we read in Romans 9-11,—the bitter pain at the rejection of Israel, relieved by a far-off hope of their restoration, the acceptance of God’s ways as unsearchable and past finding out.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/28-28.htm" title="Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and that they will hear it....">Acts 28:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">Be it known, therefore, </span>&c. — Having reproved the unbelieving and disobedient among his hearers, he assured them that the salvation of God, which they despised and seemed to fortify themselves against, was <span class="ital">sent unto the Gentiles — </span>Namely, more especially from that time; and that they would hear and embrace it, and so inherit the blessings which these Jews rejected. His words imply, that he would, from that day forward, turn to the Gentiles; and would seek, in their faith and obedience, his consolation under that grief which the infidelity of his brethren gave him. Before this, it must be observed, no apostle had been at Rome. St. Paul was the first. <span class="ital">And when he had said these words </span>— The last, it seems, that he now uttered among them; <span class="ital">the Jews departed </span>— Out of the place, not being prevailed upon to receive Jesus as the Messiah; and had <span class="ital">great reasoning </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">συζητησιν</span>, <span class="ital">disputations; among themselves </span>— Some thinking there was considerable weight in what Paul had urged to defend the gospel, while others, still retaining their sinful and inveterate prejudices against it, were enraged, and spake of him and his arguments with great contempt and indignation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:23-31 Paul persuaded the Jews concerning Jesus. Some were wrought upon by the word, and others hardened; some received the light, and others shut their eyes against it. And the same has always been the effect of the gospel. Paul parted with them, observing that the Holy Ghost had well described their state. Let all that hear the gospel, and do not heed it, tremble at their doom; for who shall heal them, if God does not? The Jews had afterwards much reasoning among themselves. Many have great reasoning, who do not reason aright. They find fault with one another's opinions, yet will not yield to truth. Nor will men's reasoning among themselves convince them, without the grace of God to open their understandings. While we mourn on account of such despisers, we should rejoice that the salvation of God is sent to others, who will receive it; and if we are of that number, we should be thankful to Him who hath made us to differ. The apostle kept to his principle, to know and preach nothing but Christ and him crucified. Christians, when tempted from their main business, should bring themselves back with this question, What does this concern the Lord Jesus? What tendency has it to bring us to him, and to keep us walking in him? The apostle preached not himself, but Christ, and he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Though Paul was placed in a very narrow opportunity for being useful, he was not disturbed in it. Though it was not a wide door that was opened to him, yet no man was suffered to shut it; and to many it was an effectual door, so that there were saints even in Nero's household, Php 4:22. We learn also from Php 1:13, how God overruled Paul's imprisonment for the furtherance of the gospel. And not the residents at Rome only, but all the church of Christ, to the present day, and in the most remote corner of the globe, have abundant reason to bless God, that during the most mature period of his Christian life and experience, he was detained a prisoner. It was from his prison, probably chained hand to hand to the soldier who kept him, that the apostle wrote the epistles to the Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews; epistles showing, perhaps more than any others, the Christian love with which his heart overflowed, and the Christian experience with which his soul was filled. The believer of the present time may have less of triumph, and less of heavenly joy, than the apostle, but every follower of the same Saviour, is equally sure of safety and peace at the last. Let us seek to live more and more in the love of the Saviour; to labour to glorify Him by every action of our lives; and we shall assuredly, by his strength, be among the number of those who now overcome our enemies; and by his free grace and mercy, be hereafter among the blessed company who shall sit with Him upon his throne, even as He also has overcome, and is sitting on his Father's throne, at God's right hand for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The salvation of God - The knowledge of God's mode of saving people.<p>Is sent unto the Gentiles - Since you have rejected it, it will be offered to them.

How happy would it be if all Christians had the same unwavering faith and zeal as Paul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear&#8212;(See on [2148]Ac 13:44-48).

At the same time we must remember that as a background to what the Apostle here says we have his words in Romans 9-11, and the thought which he had expressed to the Roman Church that God had not really cast away His people, but whilst through their unbelief the Gentiles had been called, yet that inclusion of the heathen in the Messianic kingdom would rouse the Jews to jealousy, and that thus all Israel would be saved, <a href="/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?

We can scarcely doubt that the words are uttered not merely to condemn, but to lead to repentance; at all events it would not be possible to find stronger words against his own countrymen than those written by St. Paul in his earliest Epistle, <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:...">1 Thessalonians 2:15-16</a>; and yet we know how St. Paul, for those same countrymen, could wish himself accused; so Bethge, as against Overbeck, who can only see that in Acts the belief of the Gentiles results not in a noble jealousy, but in the bitter envy of the Jews. But there blends with the tone of sadness a note of triumph in the words <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ καὶ ἀκούσονται</span>, the future of his message is assured, and we may borrow two words as an inscription for these closing pages of St. Luke’s second treatise—the last word of the Apostle, and the last of the historian—<span class="greekheb">ἀκούσονται</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀκωλύτως</span>—the word of God was heard and welcomed, and that word was not bound, see the suggestive remarks of Bethge, p. 335, and Zöckler on <a href="/acts/28-31.htm" title="Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.">Acts 28:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[436] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">the</span> [<span class="ital">R.
