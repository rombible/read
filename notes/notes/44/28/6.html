Their thoughts may have travelled quickly to the attributes of the deities who, like Apollo or Æsculapius, were depicted as subduing serpents. The sudden change of belief may be noted as presenting a kind of inverted parallelism with that which had come over the people of Lystra.

Those who are despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the more polished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians, condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. The people thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent by Divine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is a God who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass by chance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; and that evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God will reward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is a dreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But they thought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some are made examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and a Providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a judgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter in a true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, for the trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul's deliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holy resolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of our consciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into the fire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. God hereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for the receiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people in every place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those in affliction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When he should have swollen - When they expected that he would have swollen from the bite of the viper.

With the venomous bite of the viper; swelling is one of the symptoms following the bite of this creature; and if the bite does not issue in death, yet the swelling continues inflamed for some time. The symptoms following the bite of a viper are said to be (r) an acute pain in the place wounded; swelling, first red, afterwards livid, spreading by degrees; great faintness; a quick, low, and sometimes interrupted pulse; sickness at the stomach; bilious convulsions: vomiting; cold sweats; sometimes pains about the navel; and death itself, if the strength of the patient, or the slightness of the bite, do not overcome it: if he does overcome it, the swelling continues inflamed for some time; and the symptoms abating, from the wound runs a sanious liquor, little pustules are raised about it, and the colour of the skin is as if the patient were icterical or jaundice; or had the jaundice: the Arabic and Ethiopic versions render it, "that he should burn", or "burnt"; that is, inflamed, for the bite of the viper causes an inflammation, a hot swelling, which rises up in pustules or blisters: <p>or fallen down dead suddenly; for immediate death is sometimes the effect of such poison. Pliny (s) relates, that the Scythians dip their arrows in the sanies or corrupt matter of vipers, and in human blood, which by the least touch causes immediate death; and Pausanias (t) reports from a certain Phoenician, that a man fleeing from a viper got up into a tree, where the viper could not reach him, but it blew, or breathed out its poison on the tree, and the man immediately died: though the force of this creature's poison does not always, and in all places, and in all persons operate alike; some die within a few hours, and others live some days, some to the third day, and some to the seventh (u): <p>but after they had looked a great while; upon the apostle, to observe whether any inflammation or swelling arose, or death ensued, as they expected: when they had waited some time, perhaps an hour or two, <p>and saw no harm come to him; that he was neither inflamed, nor swelled, nor dead; that it had no manner of effect upon him, and no evil of punishment was inflicted on him hereby, from whence they could conclude that he was guilty of any notorious crime: <p>they changed their minds, and said that he was a god: before they took him to be a murderer, and now they even ascribe deity to him, as was usual with the Gentiles, when anything extraordinary was performed by men: so the Lystrians took Paul for Mercury, and Barnabas for Jupiter, upon the apostle's curing the cripple, <a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11</a>; but what god the inhabitants of Melita thought him to be, is not certain; some think Hercules, who was worshipped in this island. The inhabitants of this island now believe that the apostle expelled all poison and venom out of it when he was there; and it is reported, that the children born in this place fear not any snakes, neither are hurt by anything that is venomous, insomuch that they will take scorpions, and eat them without danger; although, in all other parts of the world, those kind of creatures are most pernicious, and yet do no manner of hurt to men in this island; yea, it is affirmed, that there is a sort of earth found here, which kills serpents: as for the eating of them, the viper itself may be eaten; most authors agree (w), that there is no part, humour, or excrement, not even the gall itself, of a viper, but may be swallowed without much harm; accordingly the ancients, and, as several authors assure us, the Indians at this day, both of the east and west, eat them as we do eels--viper's flesh either roasted or boiled, physicians unanimously prescribe as an excellent restorative, particularly in the elephantiasis, incurable consumptions, leprosy, &amp;c. <p>(r) Chambers's Cyclopaedia, ut supra.

This word is used eleven times by St. Luke, twice by St. Matthew, and three times in the Second Epistle of Peter (see <a href="/acts/3-5.htm">Acts 3:5</a>; <a href="/luke/1-21.htm">Luke 1:21</a>, etc.). It is also common in the LXX. But it is a word much employed by medical writers in speaking of the course they <span class="accented">expect</span> a disease to take, and the results they look for. And this is the more remarkable here because there are no fewer than three other medical phrases in this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">be</span>sides those immediately preceding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (according to several good manuscripts and editions) <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. So that it looks as if, having once got into a medical train of thought from the subject he was writing about, medical language naturally came uppermost in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">Have swollen</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, only here in the Bible, and not found in this sense in older classical writers. But it is the usual medical word for "inflammation" in any part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Fallen down</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, only here and in <a href="/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>, and twice in the LXX.; but common in Homer and elsewhere, and especially frequent in medical writers of persons falling down in fits, or weakness, or wounded, or the like. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing amiss</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Mr. Hobart quotes a remarkable parallel to this phrase from Damocrites, quoted by Galen. He says that whosoever, having been bitten by a mad dog, drinks a certain antidote (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fb3;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), "shall suffer no harm." It is used in medical writers in two senses - of" unusual symptoms," and of fatal consequences. In the New Testament it only occurs elsewhere in <a href="/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41</a>, "Nothing amiss;" and <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>.

It is a graphic picture of the fickleness of an untutored mind yielding to every impulse. The impunity with which St. Paul endured the bite of the viper was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise in <a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> (see further note on ver. 8). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/28.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Swollen (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
