But Christ now fulfilled in Paul the promise made to his disciples, <span class="ital">they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them. But after they had looked a great while </span>— Expecting every moment the pernicious effects of the venom to appear, to their astonishment they <span class="ital">saw no harm come to him </span>— God hereby intended to make him remarkable among this barbarous people, and so to prepare the way for their receiving the doctrine of salvation from his lips: <span class="ital">they changed their minds, and said that he was a god </span>— Some deity, descended in a human form; supposing that no less power than that of a god could ward off so extreme a danger. Such is the stability of human reason! A little before he was a murderer; and presently he is a god! Just like the people of Lystra; one hour sacrificing to this same apostle, and the next stoning him. Nay, but there is a medium: he is neither a murderer nor a god, but a man of God. But natural men never run into greater mistakes than in judging of the children of God. Grotius, Whitby, and some others, think that these Melitese took Paul for Hercules, <span class="greekheb">Αλεξικακος</span>, (<span class="ital">the driver away of evil,</span>) who was worshipped in this island, and was, according to Ptolemy, one of the gods of the Phenicians.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 God can make strangers to be friends; friends in distress. Those who are despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the more polished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians, condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. The people thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent by Divine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is a God who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass by chance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; and that evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God will reward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is a dreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But they thought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some are made examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and a Providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a judgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter in a true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, for the trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul's deliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holy resolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of our consciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into the fire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. God hereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for the receiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people in every place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those in affliction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shook off ... - In this was remarkably fulfilled the promise of the Saviour <a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>; "They shall take up serpents," etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. shook off the beast and felt no harm&#8212;See Mr 16:18.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As Daniel in the lion’s den.

The natives of that isle are, as it were, a terror to serpents. Scorpions, a deadly animal elsewhere, are seen harmless in the hands of children in sport. I have seen a person who ate them; which, they say, is due to Paul, when bitten, having shaken off the viper hanging to his finger without hurt. If this be true, <span class="ital">subjoins Illyricus</span>, we must no doubt suppose that it is the peculiar blessing of GOD, who, as it were, left an eternal memorial of the Gospel having been preached there, and so many miracles performed; even as the Scripture often testifies that GOD makes lands cither worse or better on account of the sins of men, or even, on the other hand, on account of His own extraordinary compassion. Even as evident experience testifies that the soil and clime itself of Germany, and of all the northern regions, are far milder, and more salubrious and fertile, than they were formerly before the birth of Christ, as is clear from writers worthy of credit,” etc.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Howbeit</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">look</span> for <span class="accented">felt</span>, A.V. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/28.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The beast (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Luke uses the word in the same way as the medical writers, who employed it to denote venomous serpents, and particularly the viper; so much so that an antidote, made chiefly from the flesh of vipers, was termed &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;. A curious bit of etymological history attaches to this latter word. From it came the Latin theriaca, of which our treacle (molasses) is a corruption. Treacle, therefore, is originally a preparation of viper's flesh, and was used later of any antidote. Thus Coverdale's translation of <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a> has, "There is no more treacle in Gilead." Gurnall ("Christian in Complete Armor") says: "The saints' experiences help them to a sovereign treacle made of the scorpion's own flesh (which they through Christ have slain), and that hath a virtue above all other to expel the venom of Satan's temptations from the heart." So Jeremy Taylor' "We kill the viper and make treacle of him." </body></html>
