even those very persons who have been most distracted with terrors on that account. God's time to help, is when things are brought to the last extremity. Peter was assured that the Lord would cause this trial to end in the way that should be most for his glory. Those who are delivered out of spiritual imprisonment must follow their Deliverer, like the Israelites when they went out of the house of bondage. They knew not whither they went, but knew whom they followed. When God will work salvation for his people, all difficulties in their way will be overcome, even gates of iron are made to open of their own accord. This deliverance of Peter represents our redemption by Christ, which not only proclaims liberty to the captives, but brings them out of the prison-house. Peter, when he recollected himself, perceived what great things God had done for him. Thus souls delivered out of spiritual bondage, are not at first aware what God has wrought in them; many have the truth of grace, that want evidence of it. But when the Comforter comes, whom the Father will send, sooner or later, he will let them know what a blessed change is wrought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when Herod would have brought him forth - When he was about to bring him to be put to death.<p>The same night - That is, the night preceding. The intention of Herod was to bring him out as soon as the Passover was over; but during the night which immediately preceded the day in which he intended to bring him to punishment, Peter was rescued.<p>Peter was sleeping - Here is an instance of remarkable composure, and an illustration of the effects of peace of conscience and of confidence in God. It was doubtless known to Peter what the intention of Herod was. James had just been put to death, and Peter had no reason to expect a better fate. And yet in this state he slept as quietly as if there had been no danger, and it was necessary that he should be roused even by an angel to contemplate his condition and to make his escape. There is nothing that will give quiet rest and gentle sleep so certainly as a conscience void of offence; and in the midst of imminent dangers, he who confides in God may rest securely and calmly. Compare <a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>.<p>Between two soldiers - See the notes on <a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>. Peter was bound to the two. His left hand was chained to the right hand of one of the soldiers, and his right hand to the left hand of the other. This was a common mode of securing prisoners among the Romans. See abundant authorities for this quoted in Lardner's Credibility, part 1, chapter 10: section 9, London edition, 1829, vol. i. p. 242, 243, etc.<p>And the keepers ... - See <a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>. Two soldiers were stationed at the door. We may see now that every possible precaution was used to ensure the safe custody of Peter:<p>(1) He was in prison.<p>(2) he was under the charge of sixteen men, who could relieve each other when weary, and thus every security was given that he could not escape by inattention on their part.<p>(3) he was bound fast between two men. And,<p>(4) He was further guarded by two others, whose business it was to watch the door of the prison. It is to be remembered, also, that it was death for a Roman soldier to be found sleeping at his post. But God can deliver in spite of all the precautions of people; and it is easy for him to overcome the most cunning devices of his enemies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. And when Herod would have brought him forth&#8212;"was going to bring him forth."<p>the same night&#8212;but a few hours before the intended execution. Thus long were the disciples kept waiting; their prayers apparently unavailing, and their faith, as would seem from the sequel, waxing feeble. Such, however, is the "law" of God's procedure (De 32:36 and see on [1998]Joh 21:3).<p>Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains&#8212;Roman prisoners had a chain fastened at one end to the wrist of their fight hand, and at the other to the wrist of a soldier's left hand, leaving the right arm of the keeper free in case of any attempt to escape. For greater security the prisoner was sometimes, as here, chained to two soldiers, one on each side. (See Ac 21:23.) Ye think your prey secure, bloodthirsty priests and thou obsequious tyrant who, to "please the Jews," hast shut in this most eminent of the servants of Christ within double gates, guarded by double sentinels, while double keepers and double chains seem to defy all rescue! So thought the chief priests, who "made the sepulchre of the Lord sure, sealing the stone and setting a watch." But "He that sitteth in heaven shall laugh at you." Meanwhile, "Peter is sleeping!" In a few hours he expects a stingless death; "neither counts he his life dear unto him, so that he may finish his course with joy and the ministry which he has received of the Lord Jesus." In this frame of spirit he has dropped asleep, and lies the picture of peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Brought him forth, </span> to be put to death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The same night:</span> this is a night to be remembered, as that in which God delivered his Israel out of Egypt: when both were come to the utmost extremity, and at the pit’s brink, then so God does his marvellous work of deliverance, that it ought to be had in remembrance, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/105-5.htm" title="Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;">Psalm 105:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Peter was sleeping:</span> innocency hath this advantage, and a good conscience acquiesces in the providence of God; it hath God to its friend; and if he be for us, who can be against us? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Bound with two chains:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/12-4.htm" title="And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.">Acts 12:4</a></span>: to which may be added, that with one chain St. Peter’s right hand was bound to the soldier’s left; with the other chain his left hand to the other soldier’s right; for so was their manner for their greater security, that they might not let the prisoner escape: thus persecutors are skilful to destroy; but no device can avail against any whom God will save. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Herod would have brought him forth,....
