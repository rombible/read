The phrase was half-technical, half-euphemistic. Capital punishment was, according to Roman usage, the almost inevitable penalty for allowing a prisoner to escape. So at Philippi, the gaoler, when he thought the prisoners had escaped, was on the point of anticipating the sentence by suicide (<a href="/acts/16-28.htm" title="But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here.">Acts 16:28</a>).

These Christians continued in prayer for Peter, for they were truly in earnest. Thus men ought always to pray, and not to faint. As long as we are kept waiting for a mercy, we must continue praying for it. But sometimes that which we most earnestly wish for, we are most backward to believe. The Christian law of self-denial and of suffering for Christ, has not done away the natural law of caring for our own safety by lawful means. In times of public danger, all believers have God for their hiding-place; which is so secret, that the world cannot find them. Also, the instruments of persecution are themselves exposed to danger; the wrath of God hangs over all that engage in this hateful work. And the range of persecutors often vents itself on all in its way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He examined the keepers - The soldiers who were entrusted with his custody. Probably only those who had the special care of him at that watch of the night. The word "examine" here means "to inquire diligently, to make investigation." He subjected them to a rigid scrutiny to ascertain the manner of his escape; for it is evident that Herod did not mean to admit the possibility of a miraculous interposition.<p>Should be put to death - For having failed to keep Peter. This punishment they had a right to expect for having suffered his escape.<p>And he went down ... - How soon after the escape of Peter he went down to Caesarea, or how long he abode there, is not known. Caesarea was rising into magnificence, and the Roman governors made it often their abode. See the notes on <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a>, <a href="/acts/25-4.htm">Acts 25:4</a>. This journey of Herod is related by Josephus (Antiq., book 19, chapter 8, section 2). He says that it was after he had reigned over all Judea for three years.<p>And there abode - That is, until his death, which occurred shortly after. We do not learn that he made any further inquiry after Peter, or that he attempted any further persecutions of the Christians. The men on guard were undoubtedly put to death; and thus Herod used all his power to create the impression that Peter had escaped by their negligence; and this would undoubtedly be believed by the Jews. See <a href="/matthew/28-15.htm">Matthew 28:15</a>. He might himself, perhaps, have been convinced, however, that the escape was by miracle, and afraid to attempt any further persecutions; or the affairs of his government might have called off his attention to other things; and thus, as in the case of the. "persecution that arose about Stephen," the political changes and dangers might divert the attention from putting Christians to death. See the notes on <a href="/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31</a>. Thus, by the providence of God, this persecution, that had been commenced, not by popular tumult, but by royal authority and power, and that was aimed at the very pillars of the church, ceased. The prayers of the church prevailed; and the monarch was overcome, disappointed, bummed, and, by divine judgment, soon put to death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. examined the keepers&#8212;who, either like the keepers of our Lord's sepulchre, had "shaken and become as dead men" (Mt 28:4), or had slept on their watch and been divinely kept from awaking.<p>commanded that they should be put to death&#8212;Impotent vengeance!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He examined the keepers; </span> that is, judicially; proceeding against them for the escape of St. Peter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Commanded that they should be put to death; </span> they were sentenced to be led away, and it is most probably thought, unto the place of execution.
