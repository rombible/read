And we are too apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, prove very teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut out those from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are not in every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should at all times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead of taking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain our motives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching is certainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are very zealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they do not withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, when made sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners. Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but his mighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.
