It will be shown, however, in the Notes on Acts 15 that it is far more likely that he speaks of the journey there narrated. St. Luke would hardly have passed over the facts to which St. Paul refers, had they occurred on this occasion; nor are there any signs that the Pharisaic party had at this time felt strong enough to insist on the circumcision of the Gentile converts. It is probable that the journey would be timed so as to coincide with one of the Jewish festivals, and judging by the analogy of St. Paul’s other visits, we may think of this as coinciding with that of Pentecost. (See Notes on <a href="/acts/18-21.htm" title="But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again to you, if God will.

The proper meaning of this name is, a follower of Christ; it denotes one who, from serious thought, embraces the religion of Christ, believes his promises, and makes it his chief care to shape his life by Christ's precepts and example. Hence it is plain that multitudes take the name of Christian to whom it does not rightly belong. But the name without the reality will only add to our guilt. While the bare profession will bestow neither profit nor delight, the possession of it will give both the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Grant, Lord, that Christians may forget other names and distinctions, and love one another as the followers of Christ ought to do. True Christians will feel for their brethren under afflictions. Thus will fruit be brought forth to the praise and glory of God. If all mankind were true Christians, how cheerfully would they help one another!

This is the first mention which we have in the New Testament of elders, or presbyters, in the Christian church. The word literally denotes "aged men," but in the Jewish synagogue it was merely a name of office. It is clear, however, I think, that the elders of the Jewish synagogue here are not included, for the relief Was intended for the "brethren" (<a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>); that is, the Christians who were at Jerusalem, and it is not probable that a charity like. this would have been entrusted to the hands of Jewish elders. The connection here does not enable us to determine anything about the sense in which the word was used. I think it probable that it does not refer to officers in the church, but that it means simply that the charity was entrusted to the aged, prudent, and experienced men in the church, for distribution among the members. Calvin supposes that the apostles were particularly intended. But this is not probable. It is possible that the deacons, who were probably aged men, may be here particularly referred to, but it seems more probable that the charity was sent to the aged members of the church without respect to their office, to be distributed according to their discretion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. sent it to the elders&#8212;an office well known to be borrowed from the synagogue; after the model of which, and not at all of the temple, the Christian Churches were constituted by the apostles.<p>by the hands of Barnabas and Saul&#8212;This was Saul's Second Visit to Jerusalem after his conversion.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To the elders; </span> to the apostles; or if they (as it is probable) were gone out of Jerusalem, to the governors or chief of the churches; for the famine being to come over all Judea, it is most probable that the other churches, besides that in Jerusalem, did partake of this bounty. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which they also did,....

Bishop Lightfoot (with whom Dr. Sanday and Dr. Hort substantially agree) maintains that Barnabas and Saul went up to Jerusalem in the early months of 44, during Herod’s persecution, deposited their <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> with the elders, and returned without delay. If we ask why “elders” are mentioned, and not Apostles, the probability is suggested that the Apostles had fled from Jerusalem and were in hiding. Against this view Ramsay strongly protests, not only on account of the part assigned to the leading Apostles, but also because of the meaning which he attaches to the <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> of Barnabas and Saul (see on <a href="/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>). The elders, not Apostles, are mentioned because the embassy was of a purely business kind, and it was not fit that the Apostles should serve tables. Moreover, Ramsay places the visit of Barnabas and Saul to Jerusalem in 45, or preferably in 46, at the commencement of the great famine in Judæa—not in 44, but in 45. Still, as Dr. Sanday urges, the entire omission of any reference to the Apostles is strange (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Blass on <a href="/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>, <a href="/acts/12-17.htm" title="But he, beckoning to them with the hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things to James, and to the brothers. And he departed, and went into another place.">Acts 12:17</a>, who holds that the Apostles had fled), especially as elsewhere Apostles and elders are constantly bracketed together as a single body (<a href="/acts/15-2.htm" title="When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.">Acts 15:2</a>; <a href="/acts/15-4.htm" title="And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.">Acts 15:4</a>; <a href="/acts/15-6.htm" title="And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.">Acts 15:6</a>; <a href="/context/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:...">Acts 15:22-23</a>, <a href="/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/21-18.htm" title="And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.">Acts 21:18</a>). Nor does it follow that because James, presumably “the brother of the Lord,” is mentioned as remaining in Jerusalem during the persecution (but see Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Gal.</span>, p. 127, note), which his reputation for sanctity amongst his countrymen might have enabled him to do, that the other Apostles could have done so with equal safety. But Ramsay at all events relieves us from the difficulty involved in the entrance of Paul into Jerusalem at a time of persecution, and the more so in view of the previous plots against his life, a difficulty which is quite unsatisfactorily met by supposing that Paul did not enter the city at all for some unknown reasons, or more unsatisfactorily still by attributing to the author of Acts a mistake in asserting that any visit of Paul to Jerusalem was made at this time. On the chronological order involved in accordance with the two views mentioned, see Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, pp. 48 ff., 68, 69; Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Gal.</span>, p. 124, note; and, as space forbids more, for the whole question <span class="ital">Expositor</span> for February and March, 1896; Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Gal.</span>, p. 123 ff.; Hort, <span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 61, and <span class="ital">Ecclesia</span>, p. 62; Wendt, p. 265 (1888) and p. 218 (1899).—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους</span>, see previous verse. It is also noticeable that St. Luke gives no account of the appointment of the elders; he takes it for granted. These Christian elders are therefore in all probability no new kind of officers, but a continuation in the Christian Church of the office of the <span class="greekheb">זְקֵנִים</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτεροι</span>, to whom probably the government of the Synagogue was assigned—hence we may account for St. Luke’s silence (Moberly, <span class="ital">Ministerial Priesthood</span>, p. 141; Hort, <span class="ital">Ecclesia</span>, p. 62; Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, pp. 191–193; “Bishop” (Gwatkin), Hastings’ B.D.). In the Christian <span class="greekheb">συναγωγή</span> (<a href="/james/2-2.htm" title="For if there come to your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;">Jam 2:2</a>) there would naturally be elders occupying a position of trust and authority. There is certainly no reason to regard them as the Seven under another name (so Zeller, Ritschl), although it is quite conceivable that if the Seven represented the Hellenists, the elders may have been already in existence as representing the Hebrew part of the Church. But there is need to guard against the exaggeration of the Jewish nature of the office in question. In the N.T. we find mention of elders, not merely so on account of age, not merely as administrative and disciplinary officers (Hatch, <span class="ital">Bampton Lectures</span>, pp. 58, 61), as in a Jewish synagogue, but as officers of the Christian Church with spiritual functions, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/james/5-14.htm" title="Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:">Jam 5:14</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a>, <a href="/acts/20-17.htm" title="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.">Acts 20:17</a>, <a href="/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a>, and also <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;...">1 Thessalonians 5:12-14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a> (see Mayor, <span class="ital">St. James</span>, p. cxxviii; Gore, <span class="ital">Church and the Ministry</span>, pp. 253, 263, and note ). At the same time there is nothing to surprise us in the fact that the administration of alms should be connected <span class="ital">in loco</span> with the office of elders. If they were representing the Apostles at the time in Jerusalem, it is what we should expect, since the organisation of almsgiving remained part of the Apostolic office, <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>, 2 Corinthians 8, etc.; and if in a passage from Polycarp (quoted by Dr. Hatch) we find the two connected—the presbyterate and what looks like the administration of alms, Polycarp, <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, vi., xi.—this again need not surprise us, since not only in the N.T., but from the passage referred to in Polycarp, it is evident that the elders, whilst they exercised judicial and administrative functions, exercised also spiritual gifts, and discharged the office of teachers, functions to which there was nothing analogous in the Jewish presbyters (see Gore, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, note , and Gwatkin, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 302). <span class="ital">To turn back the sheep that are gone astray</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιστρέφοντες τὰ ἀποπεπλανημένα</span>) is one of the first commands laid by Polycarp in his Epistle upon the Christian Presbyters (vi., quoted by Hatch), and from this alone it would appear that a familiar title in the Jewish Church passed into the Church of Christ, gaining therein a new and spiritual power. See further on <a href="/acts/20-17.htm" title="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.">Acts 20:17</a>, and for the use of the word in inscriptions, Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, p. 153, and <span class="ital">Neue Bibelstudien</span>, p. 160.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">to the elders</span>] The Greek word = <span class="ital">presbyters</span>.

No doubt at first the office of elder or presbyter comprised, beside the work of teaching, the general oversight of one, or it may be more, Churches.

As regards the first, with which we are now concerned, though at first sight you would have ex-peered St. Paul's next visit to Jerusalem after his conversion to be the one alluded to in Galatians it., yet the following circumstances make this impossible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The date of the visit named in Galatians it, which is distinctly stated to be <span class="accented">fourteen</span> years after that recorded in <a href="/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When St. Paul went to Jerusalem on the occasion adverted to in Galatians it.," he laid before them the gospel which he preached among the Gentiles." But at the time of this visit he had not yet begun his labors among the Gentiles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>), to which he was only called after his return (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> On the occasion spoken of in Galatians it, Paul and Barnabas were received by the chief apostles, and must have passed a considerable time at Jerusalem, with many consultations and meetings, public and private. But on this occasion, as far as appears, their visit was a very hasty one, and they saw no one but the presbyters, and returned as soon as they had handed over the collection to them (<a href="/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>). The conclusion, therefore, seems quite certain that this is not the visit referred to in Galatians it. And the hasty nature of this visit explains at once why St. Paul made no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. It had no bearing upon the course of his argument. It was not a visit to Jerusalem in the sense in which he was speaking, and he saw none of the apostles. The state of the Church at the time, James the son of Zebedee killed, Peter in prison or lately escaped "to another place" (<a href="/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>), the other apostles very likely dispersed, made it impossible. He therefore took no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. This seems quite a sufficient explanation (see the note of Bishop Ellicott on <a href="/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, and Bishop Lightfoot's convincing remarks at p. 113 of his 'Epistle to the Galatians'). There is no occasion to resort to the violent expedient of Renan, and say that Saul did not go with Barnabas at this time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
