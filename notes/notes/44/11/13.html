And we are too apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, prove very teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut out those from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are not in every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should at all times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead of taking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain our motives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching is certainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are very zealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they do not withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, when made sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners. Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but his mighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. seen an angel&#8212;literally, "the angel," for the rumor took that definite shape.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An angel, </span> who, by reason of his appearing a man, is, in <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/10-30.htm" title="And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,">Acts 10:30</a></span>, called <span class="bld">a man.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house,.... The clause, "in his house", is very appropriately put; for since an angel had entered into his house, it could not be criminal in Peter, and the six brethren, to follow him. In one place he is called a man, and in another place an angel; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-3.htm">Acts 10:3</a>, because, though he was an angel, yet he appeared in the form of a man, as it was usual for angels to do; but whether Cornelius knew that he was an angel, is not certain, since he calls him a man; and not he, but Luke the historian, and Peter, who repeats the account of the vision, call him an angel; however, he looked upon him as an extraordinary person, as sent to him from God, and therefore obeyed the heavenly vision.

This is one of the numerous insertions by which a repetition of a narrative in this book has been brought into exact verbal accord with the previous form. There have been times when devout men thought much of this verbal accord. It is therefore worth notice that the writers of the N. T. disregarded it utterly. The words in such a solemn inscription as that above the Cross differ in all the four Gospels, and St Peter, when in the Second Epistle (<a href="/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a>) he speaks of the heavenly voice heard at the Transfiguration, varies verbally from each of the accounts of the Evangelists.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/11-13.htm" title="And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;">Acts 11:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν ἄγγελον</span>, <span class="ital">the angel</span>) He speaks, adding the article, as of an occurrence now very well known to him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Told</span> for showed, A.V.; <span class="accented">the angel</span> for <span class="accented">an angel</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">standing in his house and saying</span> for <span class="accented">in his house which stood and said unto him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">send</span> for <span class="accented">send men</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="accented">fetch</span> for <span class="accented">call for</span>, A.V. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>An angel<p>It has the definite article: "the angel," mentioned in ch. 10. </body></html>
