We may well believe that Saul and Barnabas were active in stirring up the Gentiles to this work of charity. It was the beginning of that collection for the “poor saints at Jerusalem” which was afterwards so prominent in the Apostle’s labours (<a href="/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.">Acts 24:17</a>; <a href="/context/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25-26</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:">2Corinthians 9:1-15</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>), and which he regarded as a bond of union between the Jewish and Gentile sections of the Church. It is probable that the generous devotion and liberality of the converts of Jerusalem in the glow of their first love had left them more exposed than most others to the pressure of poverty, and that when the famine came it found them to a great extent dependent on the help of other churches.<p><span class= "bld">Determined to send relief.</span>—The Greek gives the more specific <span class= "ital">to send as a ministration, </span>the half-technical word which St. Paul uses in <a href="/romans/15-31.htm" title="That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;">Romans 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:">2Corinthians 9:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:...">Acts 11:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then the disciples </span>— Foreseeing the distress they would otherwise be in, on account of that famine; <span class="ital">determined to send relief unto the brethren in Judea </span>— <span class="greekheb">Καθως ηυπορειτο τις</span>, <span class="ital">according as each was prospered, </span>or, <span class="ital">according to the abundance which each had; </span>these disciples being, doubtless, some in more plentiful circumstances than others. “This their determination was extremely proper; for the churches of Judea being more exposed than other churches to persecution, and the rapacity of the Roman officers, and to those outrages which the populace, under weak and corrupt governments, commit upon the objects of their hatred, the brethren in Judea could not have supported this dearth, if they had not been assisted from abroad.” — Macknight. These disciples, therefore, at Antioch, having made collections for them, sent the money, not to the apostles, (for they had now given up the management of the funds of the church in Jerusalem to others,) but <span class="ital">to the elders </span>— Or rulers of that church, chosen, perhaps, out of the one hundred and twenty, on whom the Holy Ghost fell at first. And these were to deliver it to the deacons, or otherwise to make distribution thereof to the brethren, according to their need. By sending this seasonable gift to the brethren in Judea, the disciples at Antioch, among whom were many Gentile proselytes, gave proof of the reality of their conversion, and did what they could to conciliate the good-will of the Jewish believers. And this mark of their regard seems to have been well received by them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:25-30 Hitherto the followers of Christ were called disciples, that is, learners, scholars; but from that time they were called Christians. The proper meaning of this name is, a follower of Christ; it denotes one who, from serious thought, embraces the religion of Christ, believes his promises, and makes it his chief care to shape his life by Christ's precepts and example. Hence it is plain that multitudes take the name of Christian to whom it does not rightly belong. But the name without the reality will only add to our guilt. While the bare profession will bestow neither profit nor delight, the possession of it will give both the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Grant, Lord, that Christians may forget other names and distinctions, and love one another as the followers of Christ ought to do. True Christians will feel for their brethren under afflictions. Thus will fruit be brought forth to the praise and glory of God. If all mankind were true Christians, how cheerfully would they help one another! The whole earth would be like one large family, every member of which would strive to be dutiful and kind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the disciples - The Christians at Antioch.<p>According to his ability - According as they had prospered.

At first the poorer converts had been sustained by the common fund, but persecution had driven away great numbers of the Christians, and those would be most likely to depart who possessed means to support themselves in other places. Thus the mother-church would be deprived of those members who were best able to give relief in such a severe time of distress.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:">Acts 11:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μαθητῶν</span>, each <span class="ital">of the disciples</span>) Luke does not say, <span class="ital">of the Christians</span>.

The same idea appears in our farewell; fare meaning originally to travel. Hence, to bid one farewell is to wish him a prosperous journey. Compare God-speed.
