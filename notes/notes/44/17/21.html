It was wholly given to idolatry. The zealous advocate for the cause of Christ will be ready to plead for it in all companies, as occasion offers. Most of these learned men took no notice of Paul; but some, whose principles were the most directly contrary to Christianity, made remarks upon him. The apostle ever dwelt upon two points, which are indeed the principal doctrines of Christianity, Christ and a future state; Christ our way, and heaven our end. They looked on this as very different from the knowledge for many ages taught and professed at Athens; they desire to know more of it, but only because it was new and strange. They led him to the place where judges sat who inquired into such matters. They asked about Paul's doctrine, not because it was good, but because it was new. Great talkers are always busy-bodies. They spend their time in nothing else, and a very uncomfortable account they have to give of their time who thus spend it. Time is precious, and we are concerned to employ it well, because eternity depends upon it, but much is wasted in unprofitable conversation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all the Athenians - This was their general character.<p>And strangers which were there - Athens was greatly distinguished for the celebrity of its schools of philosophy.

It is known, therefore, that it was the favorite resort of people of other nations, who came there to become acquainted with its institutions and to listen to its sages.<p>Spent their time in nothing else - The learned and subtle Athenians gave themselves much to speculation, and employed themselves in examining the various new systems of philosophy that were proposed.

The latest news; or the latest subject of inquiry proposed. This is well known to have been the character of the people of Athens at all times. "Many of the ancient writers I bear witness to the garrulity, and curiosity, and intemperate desire of novelty among the Athenians, by which they inquired respecting all things, even those in which they had no interest, whether of a public or private nature (Kuinoel). Thus, Thucydides (3, 38) says of them, "You excel in suffering yourselves to be deceived with novelty of speech." On which the old scholiast makes this remark, almost in the words of Luke: "He (Thucydides) here blames the Athenians, who care for nothing else but to tell or to hear something new." Thus, Aelian (5, 13) says of the Athenians that they are versatile in novelties. Thus, Demosthenes represents the Athenians "as inquiring in the place of public resort if there were any news" - &#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  ti neo&#772;teron Meurslus has shown, also, that there were more than 300 public places in Athens of public resort, where the principal youth and reputable citizens were accustomed to meet for the purpose of conversation and inquiry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. all the Athenians &#8230; spent their time in nothing else but to tell or hear some new thing&#8212;literally, "newer thing," as if what was new becoming presently stale, they craved something still more new [Bengel].

How fatally the more important interests of life were sacrificed to this characteristic (note imperfect tense), restless inquisitiveness, their great orator, Demosthenes, knew when he contrasted this idle curiosity with the vigour and ability of Philip of Macedon, <span class="ital">Philippic I.</span>, p. 43. The words go to support the interpretation that there was no formal indictment, but they do not destroy the view that there may have been an examinaton into the Apostle’s teaching, Curtius, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 529.—<span class="greekheb">καινότερον</span>: certainly there is, as Blass says, “mirus consensus” as to this characteristic of the Athenians; see instances in Wetstein: Dem., <span class="ital">Philippic I.</span>, 43, and <span class="ital">Philipp. Epist.</span>, 156, 157; Thuc., iii., 38; Theophr., <span class="ital">Char.</span>, iii., <span class="greekheb">περὶ λογοποΐας μὴ λέγεταί τι καινότερον</span>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Seneca, <span class="ital">Epist.</span>, 74.

The comparative may therefore indicate more vividly the voracious appetite of the Athenians for news, although it may be also said that the comparative was the usual degree used by the Greeks in the question <span class="ital">What news?</span> (usually <span class="greekheb">νεώτερον</span>); indeed their fondness for using the comparative of both <span class="greekheb">νέος</span> and <span class="greekheb">καινός</span> is quite singular (Page, see also Winer-Moulton, xxxv., 4; Blass, <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 138).

This verse is a parenthesis explanatory of what has gone before. The audience had been struck with the strange teaching, and that it was strange was enough. Novelty was their life’s pursuit. So without having any regard for the importance of the teaching, they were ready to listen because it was new.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">strangers which were there</span>] The words will bear a fuller rendering, “<span class="ital">strangers</span> <span class="bld">sojourning</span> <span class="ital">there</span>.” (So <span class="ital">R.

If all the time be spent in one way, there is no leisure left for any thing else. But the word has the further sense of “finding a favourable opportunity.” The Athenians could find time for the pursuit of novelty, but for nothing beside. The imperfect tense of the verb also implies that this was their <span class="ital">constant</span> state of mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">either to tell, or to hear some new thing</span>] This character of the Athenian populace is confirmed by many statements of classical authors. In Thuc. iii. 38 Cleon is represented as complaining of his countrymen that they were in the habit of playing the part of “spectators in displays of oratory, and listeners to the stories of what others had done;” and a like charge is made more than once by Demosthenes in his speeches on the vigorous policy of Philip of Macedon, which he contrasts with the Athenian love of talk and news.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/17.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/17-21.htm" title="(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)">Acts 17:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀθηναῖοι</span>, <span class="ital">the Athenians</span>) An elegant and characteristic description of them follows.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιδημοῦντες</span>) <span class="ital">sojourners</span>: who through sojourning among them acquire the same customs.—<span class="greekheb">εὐκαίρουν</span>, <span class="ital">used to spend their time</span>) The Preterite, whereby it is implied, what kind of hearers Paul had at that time.

The comparative was regularly used by the Greeks in the question what news? They contrasted what was new with what had been new up to the time of asking. The idiom vividly characterizes the state of the Athenian mind. Bengel aptly says, "New things at once became of no account; newer things were being sought for." Their own orators and poets lashed them for this peculiarity. Aristophanes styles Athens the city of the gapers ("Knights," 1262). Demades said that the crest of Athens ought to be a great tongue. Demosthenes asks them, "Is it all your care to go about up and down the market, asking each other, 'Is there any news?'" In the speech of Cleon to the Athenians, given by Thucydides (iii., 38), he says: "No men are better dupes, sooner deceived by novel notions, or slower to follow approved advice. You despise what is familiar, while you are worshippers of every new extravagance. You are always hankering after an ideal state, but you do not give your minds even to what is straight before you. In a word, you are at the mercy of your own ears." </body></html>
