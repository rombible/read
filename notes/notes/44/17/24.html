As asserted of the Temple at Jerusalem, it had at that time, even though it was quoted from a Jewish prophet, driven the Pharisee Saul into the frenzy of fanaticism. Now, having learnt the lesson as regards that Temple, he proclaims the truth as applicable <span class= "ital">à fortiori</span> to all temples raised by human hands. It is obvious that this truth places the sacredness of Christian churches on a ground entirely different from that which influenced the minds of Jew or Greek in regard to their respective temples. Churches are holy, not because God dwells in them, but because they are set apart for the highest acts of the collective life of the congregation of His people. In those acts men hold communion with God, and so the Church is for them all, and more than all, that the Tabernacle of Meeting (this, as meaning the place where man met God, rather than Tabernacle of the Congregation, being the true rendering of the Hebrew term; comp. <a href="/exodus/29-42.htm" title="This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you.">Exodus 29:42</a>) was to the Israelites of old. Romish theory and practice, in presenting the consecrated wafer in pyx or monstrance, or carrying it in procession, as an object of adoration, revives the old Pagan view which St. Paul disclaims.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;...">Acts 17:24-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">God that made the world </span>— Thus is demonstrated, even to reason, the one, true, good God; absolutely different from the creatures, from every part of the visible creation. <span class="ital">Seeing he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands </span>— God hath no need of temples to dwell in, seeing he hath made the world, and is the Lord, or possessor, of the universe. Ye, therefore, greatly err in thinking, that by erecting magnificent temples and images, and by consecrating them, ye draw God down into them, and prevail with him to reside among you in an especial manner. That vulgar notion is unworthy of men whose minds are improved by science, and who, from God’s having made the world, ought to know that his presence is not confined to temples made by men. <span class="ital">Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing </span>— Or, <span class="ital">person, </span>the word <span class="greekheb">τινος </span>equally taking in both: that is, Neither is the true God worshipped with sacrifices and meats prepared by men’s hands, if these things are offered to him, as though he needed to be fed with the fruits of the earth, and with the flesh of beasts, and refreshed with the steams of sacrifices and incense: <span class="ital">seeing he giveth to all </span>— That live and breathe, whether men or beasts; <span class="ital">life </span>— For in him we live; <span class="ital">and breath </span>— In him we move; and <span class="ital">all things </span>— For in him we are: whence it is evident that men can contribute nothing to his life or happiness. <span class="ital">And hath made of one blood all nations of men </span>— Hath from one man and woman multiplied the human race, so as to form those different nations which cover the face of the whole earth; and hath everywhere made a liberal provision for them, of all the necessaries of life. How then can ye fancy that he himself needs to be lodged, and clothed, and fed by men! By speaking thus, the apostle also showed them, in the most unaffected manner, that though he was a Jew, he was not enslaved to any narrow views, but looked on all mankind as his brethren. <span class="ital">And hath determined the times before appointed </span>— Hath also assigned to each of these nations their times of existence; <span class="ital">and the bounds of their habitations </span>— By mountains, seas, rivers, and the like; that is, the particular countries they were or are to inhabit, according as he had before appointed these things. By all which he shows, that he governs the world by a most wise providence, contrary to what you Epicureans teach, and also that his government is most free, contrary to the doctrine of the Stoics.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God that made the world - The main object of this discourse of Paul is to convince them of the folly of idolatry <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>, and thus to lead them to repentance. For this purpose he commences with a statement of the true doctrine respecting God as the Creator of all things. We may observe here:<p>(1) That he speaks here of God as the Creator of the world, thus opposing indirectly their opinions that there were many gods.<p>(2) he speaks of him as the Creator of the world, and thus opposes the opinion that matter was eternal; that all things were controlled by Fate; and that God could be confined to temples. The Epicureans held that matter was eternal, and that the world was formed by a fortuitous concourse of atoms. To this opinion Paul opposed the doctrine that all things were made by one God.

God that made the world and all &#8230; therein&#8212;The most profound philosophers of Greece were unable to conceive any real distinction between God and the universe. Thick darkness, therefore, behooved to rest on all their religious conceptions. To dissipate this, the apostle sets out with a sharp statement of the fact of creation as the central principle of all true religion&#8212;not less needed now, against the transcendental idealism of our day.<p>seeing he is Lord&#8212;or Sovereign.<p>of heaven and earth&#8212;holding in free and absolute subjection all the works of His hands; presiding in august royalty over them, as well as pervading them all as the principle of their being.

In this account of the divine Being, as the Creator of the world, and all things in it, as the apostle agrees with Moses, and the rest of the sacred Scriptures; so he condemns both the notion of the Epicurean philosophers, who denied that the world was made by God, but said that it owed its being to a fortuitous concourse of atoms; and the notion of the Peripatetics, or Aristotelians, who asserted the eternity of the world; and some of both sects were doubtless present. <p>Seeing that he is the Lord of heaven and earth; as appears by his being the Creator of both; hence he supports them in their being, and governs all creatures in them by his providence. <p>Dwelleth not in temples made with hands; such as were the idol temples at Athens; nor in any other edifices built by man, so as to be there fixed and limited; no, not in the temple at Jerusalem: but he dwells in temples that are not made with hands, as in the temple of Christ's human nature, in which the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, and in the hearts of his people, who are the temples of the Holy Ghost. This strikes at a notion of the Athenians, as if God was limited, and circumscribed, and included within the bounds of a shrine, or temple, though it is not at all contrary to his promises, or the hopes of his own people, of his presence in places appointed for divine worship, but is expressive of the infinity and immensity of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</span><p>(13) It is a most foolish and vain thing to compare the Creator with the creature, to limit him within a place who can be comprehended in no place, and to think to allure him with gifts, from whom all men have received all things whatever they have: and these are the fountains of all idolatry.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;...">Acts 17:24-25</a>.

St. Paul applies it, too, to the circumcision made with the knife, as distinguished from that wrought by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a>). It is frequent in the LXX. It is a striking instance of St. Paul's unflinching boldness and fidelity to the truth, that he should expose the hollowness of heathen worship, standing within a stone's throw of the Parthenon and the temple of Theseus and the countless other temples of gods and goddesses, which were the pride and glory of the Athenian people.

So in classical Greek. In the Septuagint, never the world, but the ordered total of the heavenly bodies; the host of heaven (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>). Compare, also, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>, and see note on <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>. In the apocryphal books, of the universe, and mainly in the relation between God and it arising out of the creation. Thus, the king of the world (2 Maccabees 7:9); the creator or founder of the world (2 Maccabees 7:23); the great potentate of the world (2 Maccabees 12:15). In the New Testament: 1. In the classical and physical sense, the universe (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>.; <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, etc.). 2. As the order of things of which man is the centre (<a href="/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>; <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="/luke/9-25.htm">Luke 9:25</a>; <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>). 3. Humanity as it manifests itself in and through this order (<a href="/matthew/18-7.htm">Matthew 18:7</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-6.htm">2 Peter 3:6</a>; <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>). Then, as sin has entered and disturbed the order of things, and made a breach between the heavenly and the earthly order, which are one in the divine ideal - 4. The order of things which is alienated from God, as manifested in and by the human race: humanity as alienated from God, and acting in opposition to him (<a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>; <a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15</a>, etc.). The word is used here in the classical sense of the visible creation, which would appeal to the Athenians. Stanley, speaking of the name by which the Deity is known in the patriarchal age, the plural Elohim, notes that Abraham, in perceiving that all the Elohim worshipped by the numerous clans of his race meant one God, anticipated the declaration of Paul in this passage ("Jewish Church," i., 25). Paul's statement strikes at the belief of the Epicureans, that the world was made by "a fortuitous concourse of atoms," and of the Stoics, who denied the creation of the world by God, holding either that God animated the world, or that the world itself was God.<p>Made with hands (&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Probably pointing to the magnificent temples above and around him. Paul's epistles abound in architectural metaphors. He here employs the very words of Stephen, in his address to the Sanhedrim, which he very probably heard. See <a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48</a>. </body></html>
