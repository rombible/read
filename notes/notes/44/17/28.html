The first points to our animal life; the second—from which is derived the Greek word used by ethical writers for passions, such as fear, love, hate, and the like—not, as the English verb suggests, to man’s power of bodily motion in space, but to our emotional nature; the third, to that which constitutes our true essential being, the intellect and will of man. What the words express is not merely the Omnipresence of the Deity; they tell us that the power for every act and sensation and thought comes from Him. They set forth what we may venture to call the true element of Pantheism, the sense of a “presence interposed,” as in nature, “in the light of setting suns,” so yet more in man. As a Latin poet had sung, whose works may have been known to the speaker, the hearers, and the historian:—<p>“Deum namque ire per omnes<p>Terras que tractusque maris, ccelumque profundum,<p>Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,<p>Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas,<p>Scilicet hinc reddi deinde ac resoluta referri,<p>Omnia; nec morti esse locum sed viva volare<p>Sideris in numerum atque alto succedere cælo.”<p>[“God permeates all lands, all tracts of sea,<p>And the vast heaven. From Him all flocks and herds,<p>And men, and creatures wild, draw, each apart,<p>Their subtle life. To Him they all return,<p>When once again set free. No place is found<p>For death, but all mount up once more on high<p>To join the stars in their high firmament.”]<p>—Virg. <span class= "ital">Georg.</span> iv. 221-225.<p>In the teaching of St. Paul, however, the personality of God is not merged, as in that of the Pantheist, in the thought of the great Soul of the World, but stands forth with awful distinctness in the character of King and Judge. Traces of like thoughts are found in the prophetic vision of a time when God shall be “all in all” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1Corinthians 15:28</a>), the discords of the world’s history harmonised in the eternal peace.<p><span class= "bld">As certain also of your own poets have said.</span>—The quotation has a special interest as being taken from a poet who was a countryman of St. Paul’s. Aratus, probably of Tarsus (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> B.C. 272), had written a didactic poem under the title of <span class= "ital">Phenomena, </span>comprising the main facts of astronomical and meteorological science as then known. It opens with an invocation to Zeus, which contains the words that St. Paul quotes. Like words are found in a hymn to Zeus by Cleanthes (B.C. 300). Both passages are worth quoting:—<p>(1)“From Zeus begin; never let us leave<p>His name unloved. With Him, with Zeus, are filled<p>All paths we tread, and all the marts of men;<p>Filled, too, the sea, and every creek and bay;<p>And all in all things need we help of Zeus,<p><span class= "ital">For we too are his offspring.”</span><p>—Aratus, <span class= "ital">Phænom.</span> 1–5.<p>(2)“Most glorious of immortals, many-named,<p>Almighty and for ever, thee, O Zeus,<p>Sovran o’er Nature, guiding with thy hand<p>All things that are, we greet with praises. Thee<p>’Tis meet that mortals call with one accord,<p><span class= "ital">For we thine offspring are, </span>and we alone<p>Of all that live and move upon this earth,<p>Receive the gift of imitative speech.”<p>—Cleanthes, <span class= "ital">Hymn to Zeus.</span><p>The fact of the quotation would at once quicken the attention of the hearers. They would feel that they had not to deal with an illiterate Jew, like the traders and exorcists who were so common in Greek cities, but with a man of culture like their own, acquainted with the thoughts of some at least of their great poets.<p><span class= "bld">We are also his offspring.</span>—We too often think of the quotation only as happily introduced at the time; but the fact that it was quoted shows that it had impressed itself, it may be, long years before, on St. Paul’s memory. As a student at Tarsus it had, we may well believe, helped to teach him the meaning of the words of his own Scriptures: “I have nourished and brought up children” (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>). The method of St. Paul’s teaching is one from which modern preachers might well learn a lesson. He does not begin by telling men that they have thought too highly of themselves, that they are vile worms, creatures of the dust, children of the devil. The fault which he finds in them is that they have taken too low an estimate of their position. They too had forgotten that they were God’s offspring, and had counted themselves, even as the unbelieving Jews had done (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a>) “unworthy of eternal life.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in him we live - The expression "in him" evidently means by him; by his originally forming us, and continually sustaining us. No words can better express our constant dependence on God. He is the original fountain of life, and he upholds us each moment. A similar sentiment is found in Plautus (5, 4,14): "O Jupiter, who dost cherish and nourish the race of man; by whom we live, and with whom is the hope of the life of all men" (Kuinoel). It does not appear, however, that Paul designed this as a quotation; yet he doubtless intended to state a sentiment with which they were familiar, and with which they would agree.<p>And move - &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;  kinoumetha. Doddridge translates this, "And are moved." It may, however, be in the middle voice, and be correctly rendered as in our version. It means that we derive strength to move from him; an expression denoting "constant and absolute dependence." There is no idea of dependence more striking than that we owe to him the ability to perform the slightest motion.<p>And have our being - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;  kai esmen. And are. This denotes that our "continued existence" is owing to Him. That we live at all is his gift; that we have power to move is his gift; and our continued and prolonged existence is his gift also. Thus, Paul traces our dependence on him from the lowest pulsation of life to the highest powers of action and of continued existence. It would be impossible to express in more emphatic language our entire dependence On God.<p>As certain also - As some. The sentiment which he quotes was found substantially in several Greek poets.<p>Of your own poets - He does not refer particularly here to poets of Athens, but to Greek poets who had written in their language.<p>For we are also his offspring - This precise expression is found in Aratus ("Phaenom.," v. 5), and in Cleanthus in a hymn to Jupiter. Substantially the same sentiment is found in several other Greek poets. Aratus was a Greek poet of Cilicia the native place of Paul, and flourished about 277 years before Christ. As Paul was a native of the same country it is highly probable he was acquainted with his writings. Aratus passed much of his time at the court of Antigonus Gonatas, king of Macedonia. His principal work was the "Phoenomena," which is here quoted, and was so highly esteemed in Greece that many learned men wrote commentaries on it. The sentiment here quoted was directly at variance with the views of the Epicureans; and it is proof of Paul's address and skill, as well as his acquaintance with his auditors and with the Greek poets, that he was able to adduce a sentiment so directly in point, and that had the concurrent testimony of so many of the Greeks themselves. It is one instance among thousands where an acquaintance with profane learning may be of use to a minister of the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. For in him we live, and move, and have our being&#8212;(or, more briefly, "exist").&#8212;This means, not merely, "Without Him we have no life, nor that motion which every inanimate nature displays, nor even existence itself" [Meyer], but that God is the living, immanent Principle of all these in men.<p>as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring&#8212;the first half of the fifth line, word for word, of an astronomical poem of Aratus, a Greek countryman of the apostle, and his predecessor by about three centuries. But, as he hints, the same sentiment is to be found in other Greek poets. They meant it doubtless in a pantheistic sense; but the truth which it expresses the apostle turns to his own purpose&#8212;to teach a pure, personal, spiritual Theism. (Probably during his quiet retreat at Tarsus. Ac 9:30, revolving his special vocation to the Gentiles he gave himself to the study of so much Greek literature as might be turned to Christian account in his future work. Hence this and his other quotations from the Greek poets, 1Co 15:33; Tit 1:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In him we live, &c.; </span> he is the God that made us, that preserves us, and not we ourselves; he keeps us as in the hollow of his hand, and compasseth our paths.

Which is, <p>for we are also his offspring; the offspring of Jove, says Aratus; which the apostle applies to the true Jehovah, the Creator of all men, by whom, and after whose image, they are made, and so are truly his offspring; upon which the apostle argues as follows. <p>(x) In Phaenomenis, p. 1.((y) Vid.

This explanation is required by the relation of the words to the preceding, according to which they are designed to prove the <span class="ital">nearness</span> of God; therefore <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> must necessarily contain the <span class="ital">local</span> reference—the idea of the divine <span class="greekheb">περιχώρησις</span> (which Chrysostom illustrates by the example of the <span class="ital">air</span> surrounding us on all sides). Therefore the rendering <span class="ital">per eum</span> (Beza, Grotius, Heinrichs, Kuinoel), or, as de Wette more correctly expresses it, “resting on Him as the <span class="ital">foundation</span>” (comp. already Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">οὐκ εἶπε</span>· <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὃ ἐγγύτερον ἦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>), which would yield no connection in the way of proof with the <span class="greekheb">οὐ μακρὰν εἶναι</span> of the Godhead, is to be abandoned.

St. Chrysostom comments (<span class="ital">Hom.</span>, xxxviii.): <span class="greekheb">Τί λέ γω μακράν</span>; <span class="greekheb">οὕτως ἐγγύς ἐστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς χωρὶς αὐτοῦ μὴ ζῆν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ γὰρ ζῶμεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ εἶπε</span>, <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὃ ἐγγύτερον ἦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>. In the three verbs it has been sometimes maintained there is an ascending scale; in God we possess the gift of life, in Him we move, in Him we <span class="ital">are</span> (not “have our being” simply), <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, we are what we are, personal beings. Bethge and Plumptre may be named as two chief supporters of some such view as this, whilst others regard the words (Bengel, Weiss) as merely expressing what had been already expressed in <a href="/acts/17-25.htm" title="Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;">Acts 17:25</a>, or as referring simply (so Overbeck, Wendt, Felten) to our physical life and being.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν καθʼ ὑμᾶς π</span>.: “of your own poets,” see Grimm., <span class="ital">sub v.</span> <span class="greekheb">κατά</span>, with the accusative as a periphrasis for the possessive pronoun; see also Winer-Moulton, xxii., 7, xlix. d. Blass takes it as = <span class="greekheb">ὑμέτεροι</span>., on the reading see W. H. marg. <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμᾶς</span>, though the limited range of attestation prevents them from reading this in the text: “there would be a striking fitness in a claim by St. Paul to take his stand as a Greek among Greeks, as he elsewhere vindicates his position as a Roman (<a href="/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>; <a href="/acts/22-25.htm" title="And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?">Acts 22:25</a>; <a href="/acts/22-28.htm" title="And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.">Acts 22:28</a>), and as a Pharisee (<a href="/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.">Acts 23:6</a>)”: W. H., ii., p. 310.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν</span>: half of an hexameter, the <span class="greekheb">γὰρ καὶ</span> has nothing to do with the meaning of the quotation in the N.T., but see Winer-Moulton, liii. 10. The words are found in Aratus, B.C. 270, <span class="ital">Phœnom.</span>, 5, and Cleanthes, B.C. 300, <span class="ital">Hymn to Jove</span>, 5; for other parallels see Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and Wetstein, so that Zöckler may go too far in saying that St. Paul quoted from the former as his fellow-countryman, Aratus being of Soli in Cilicia. Both poets named were Stoics, and the words may have been well known as a familiar quotation, see on Tarsus, chapter lx. 11. In Cleanthes the actual words are rather different, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ γένος ἐσμέν</span>, where origin rather than kinship may be meant. No doubt it is possible to exaggerate, with Bentley, St. Paul’s knowledge of classical literature, but on the other hand it is not perhaps an unfair inference that a man who could quote so aptly from the poets as here in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1 Corinthians 15:35</a>, and in <a href="/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>, could have done so at other times if occasion had required, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Curtius, <span class="ital">ubi supra</span>, Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and Farrar, “Classical Quotations of St. Paul,” <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, 2, <span class="ital">Exc.</span>, 3. As the words of the hymn were addressed to Zeus, a difficulty has been raised as to the Apostle’s application of them here, and it has been questioned whether he was acquainted with the context of the words, or whether he was aware of their application. But he must at least have known that they were not originally written of the God Whom he revealed. If so, however, there seems no more difficulty in supposing that he would apply such a hemistich to a higher purpose, than that he should make the inscription on a heathen altar a text for his discourse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">for in him we live</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">through</span> or <span class="ital">by</span> Him.

The word does not refer to the motion of persons from place to place, but to those internal movements of the mind and spirit of which the outward actions are the effect. St Paul means that the feelings of men are acted on by God, who speaks to the heart through all nature if men will but hearken. This is the truth of which Pantheism is the caricature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your own poets have said</span>] The words are a quotation from Arâtus, <span class="ital">Phænomena</span>, 5, and are also found in Cleanthes, <span class="ital">Hymn to Jupiter</span>, 5. Arâtus was a native of Cilicia, and St Paul may in consequence be supposed to have known of his writings as of those of a fellow-countryman. By quoting from their own literature to the Athenians, St Paul illustrates his own declaration that in his labours “he became all things to all men.” Such a quotation was also very well devised for arresting the attention of these cultivated hearers, and winning it may be some consideration for the speaker, as also being a man of culture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/17.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν αὐτῷ</span>) <span class="ital">In Him</span>, not in ourselves: <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, <span class="ital">in</span>, expresses the most efficacious presence flowing from the most intimate tie of connection, so that we cannot think of (feel) ourselves without thinking of (feeling) Him.—<span class="greekheb">ζῶμεν καὶ κινούμεθα καὶ ἐσμὲν</span> <span class="ital">we live and move and are</span> [Engl.
