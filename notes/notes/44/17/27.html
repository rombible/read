From the Apostle’s point of view, anticipating in part the great <span class= "ital">Theodikæa</span>—the vindication of the ways of God—in the Epistle to the Romans, the whole order of the world’s history was planned, as part of the education of mankind, waking longings which it could not satisfy, leading men at once to a consciousness of the holiness of God and of their own sinfulness. The religions of the world were to him as the movements of one who climbs<p>“Upon the great world’s altar stairs,<p>That slope through darkness up to God;”<p>who can only say—<p>“I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,<p>And gather dust, and chaff, and call<p>To what I feel is Lord of all,<p>And faintly trust the larger hope.”<p>Their ritual in all its manifold variety was but as the inarticulate wailing of childhood—<p>“An infant crying for the light,<p>And with no language but a cry.”<p>—Tennyson, <span class= "ital">In Memoriam, </span>liv.<p>The “if haply” expresses the exact force of the Greek particles, which imply a doubt whether the end had been attained in its completeness. The altar to the Unknown and Unknowable was a witness that they had not been found. “The world by wisdom knew not God” (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.">1Corinthians 1:21</a>). It had not got, in the language of another poet of our own, beyond<p>“Those obstinate questionings<p>Of sense and outward things,<p>Fallings from us, vanishings;”<p>which are as the<p>“Blank misgivings of a creature<p>Moving about in worlds not realised.”<p>—Wordsworth, <span class= "ital">Ode on Immortality.</span><p><span class= "bld">Though he be not far from every one of us.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and yet He is not far.</span> The speaker appeals, as he does in <a href="/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>, to the witness borne by man’s consciousness and conscience. There, in the depths of each man’s being, not in temples made with hands, men might find God and hold communion with him. It was natural, in speaking to the peasants of Lystra, to point to the witness of “the rain from heaven and fruitful seasons.” (See Note on <a href="/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>.) It was as natural, in speaking to men of high culture and introspective analysis, to appeal to that which was within them rather than to that which was without. But it will be noted that he does not confine that witness to the seekers after wisdom. God is not far from every one of us.” St. Paul accepts the truth which St. John afterwards proclaimed, that Christ is the “true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” (See Notes on <a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>.) The writer of the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/30-11.htm" title="For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not hidden from you, neither is it far off.">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>) had asserted a like truth when he taught Israel that “the word was not in heaven, or beyond the sea,” but “in thy mouth and in thine heart, that thou mayest do it.” At this point the Stoics, we may believe, would recognise the affinities which St. Paul’s thoughts presented to their own teaching. The Epicureans would be more and more repelled by this attack on the central position of their system.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/17-27.htm" title="That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:...">Acts 17:27-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">That they should seek, </span>&c. — As if he had said, This most wise and free government of the nations of men, God carries on through all ages for this purpose, <span class="ital">that they </span>may be led to <span class="ital">seek the Lord </span>— That is, to seek the knowledge, fear, and love of him; to seek his favour, his Spirit, and communion with him: <span class="ital">if haply </span>— The way is open; God is ready to be found; but he will lay no force upon any man; <span class="ital">they might feel after him </span>— Feeling is the lowest and grossest of all our senses, and is therefore applied to that low kind of the knowledge of God which some of the heathen possessed, and which is first attained before higher discoveries of him are made. <span class="ital">Though he be not </span>— <span class="greekheb">Και τοι γε</span>, <span class="ital">and truly indeed he is not, far from any one of us — </span>Therefore, though he be not the object of men’s senses, we need not go far to seek or find him.

The structure of our bodies, and the union of our souls to these exquisite pieces of material mechanism, together with the noble faculties of our minds, wherein we resemble God, and the admirable end for which this wonderful composition of soul and body is formed, afford to every man, not only an idea, but a proof of the Deity supporting and animating him: so that no words can better express, than these of the apostle do, the continual and necessary dependance of all created beings, in their existence and all their operations, on the first, the universal, and almighty Cause, which the truest philosophy, as well as divinity teaches. <span class="ital">As certain also of your own poets have said </span>— Aratus, whose words these are, and who also added another sentence, equally just and striking, namely, <span class="ital">We are his offspring, </span>especially in respect of intelligence, and other mental powers, similar to his, with which we are endowed. This poet, Aratus, was an Athenian, who lived almost three hundred years before this time. The words are also to be found, with the alteration of one letter only, in the hymn of Cleanthes to the Supreme Being, one of the purest and finest pieces of natural religion in the whole world of pagan antiquity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they should seek the Lord - Greek: to seek the Lord. The design of thus placing them on the earth - of gang them their habitation among his works - was, that they should contemplate his wisdom in his works, and thus come to a knowledge of his existence and character. All nations, though living in different regions and climates, have thus the opportunity of becoming acquainted with God, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-20</a>. The fact that the nations did not thus learn the character of the true God shows their great stupidity and wickedness. The design of Paul in this was doubtless to reprove the idolatry of the Athenians. The argument is this: "God has given to each nation its proper opportunity to learn his character. Idolatry, therefore, is folly and wickedness, since it is possible to find out the existence of the one God from his works."<p>If haply - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;  ei ara ge.

And as the sense of touch is regarded as a certain way of ascertaining the existence and qualities of an object, the word means "to search diligently, so that we may know distinctly and certainly." The word has this sense here. It means "to search diligently and accurately for God, to learn his existence and perfections." The Syriac renders it, "That they may seek for God, and find him from his creatures."<p>And find him - Find the proofs of his existence. Become acquainted with his perfections and laws.<p>Though he be not far ... - This seems to be stated by the apostle to show that it was possible to find him; and that even those who were without a revelation need not despair of becoming acquainted with his existence and perfections. He is near to us:<p>(1) Because the proofs of his existence and power are round about us everywhere, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-6</a>.<p>(2) because he fills all things in heaven and earth by his essential presence, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23-24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2-4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>.

On St. Paul’s study of the Book of Wisdom at some time in his life see Sanday and Headlam, <span class="ital">Romans</span>, p. 52.—<span class="greekheb">ψηλαφήσειαν</span>, Æolic aorist, the verb is used several times in LXX for the act of groping in the dark, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm" title="And you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and spoiled ever more, and no man shall save you.">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <a href="/job/5-14.htm" title="They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.">Job 5:14</a>; <a href="/job/12-25.htm" title="They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them to stagger like a drunken man.">Job 12:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm" title="We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.">Isaiah 59:10</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> its use also in classical Greek, <span class="ital">Odys.</span>, ix., 416; so Plato, <span class="ital">Phædo</span>, 99 B, where it is used of vague guesses at truth (Wendt, Page). The word would therefore fitly express the thought of men stretching lame hands of faith and groping, and calling to what they feel is Lord of all. Weiss finds the idea of the word as used here, not in the LXX as above, but in <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a>, of some palpable assurance, which was everywhere possible in a world made by God, <a href="/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;">Acts 17:24</a>, <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>, and where men’s dwellings had been apportioned by Him. But the word might still be used in the above sense, since the recognition of God in His Creation is after all only a partial recognition, and not the highest knowledge of Him; and the inscription “To an Unknown God” testified in itself how imperfect that recognition had been. For the meaning of the verb in modern Greek see Kennedy, p. 156.—<span class="greekheb">καίτοιγε</span>, see critical note, <span class="greekheb">καί γε</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/2-18.htm" title="And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:">Acts 2:18</a>, <span class="ital">quin etiam</span> (<span class="ital">quamvis</span> <span class="greekheb">καίτοιγε</span> “vix aptum,” Blass). The word <span class="greekheb">ψηλαφ</span>. had intimated “et proximum esse Deum et oculis occultum” (Blass, Knabenbauer), and the Apostle now proclaims the nearness of God, not only in creation, in its maintenance and preservation, but in the spiritual being of man: “Closer is he than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet”.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ μακρὰν</span>: the word implies not mere local nearness, but spiritual, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/jeremiah/23-23.htm" title="Am I a God at hand, said the LORD, and not a God afar off?">Jeremiah 23:23</a>, and <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>. With this we may compare Seneca, <span class="ital">Ep. Mor.</span>, xliv. 1. “God is near thee; He is with thee; He is within” (quoted by Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Philippians</span>, p. 290). The relation of man to God is a personal relationship: God is not “careless of the single life”: <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ ἑνὸς ἑκάστον ἡμῶν</span>, “from each one of us,” R.V. The words may well have struck a responsive chord in the hearts, not only of some in the crowd, but of some of the Stoics who were listening, contradictory and incongruous as their system was, with its strange union of a gross material pantheism, and the expression of belief in the fatherly love and goodness of God (see further Lightfoot, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 298, and Curtius, <span class="ital">Gesammelte Abhandlungen</span>, ii., 530, 531).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">that they should seek the Lord</span>] The best authorities read “<span class="ital">seek</span> <span class="bld">God</span>.” This was the lesson which God meant His creation and providence to teach, that through His works men should see Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if haply they might feel after him, and find him</span>] The world was to be man’s book in which he should read God’s power and love; thus stimulated, a desire to know more might grow, and by efforts, which the graphic word of the Apostle compares to the exertion of one groping in the dark, more knowledge would come, and at last the full discovery would be made. God would be found.

He wishes him to be free, in such a way as that, when a man seeks and finds God, this in respect to GOD may be, in some measure, as it were a matter (an act) contingent.—<span class="greekheb">ἄραγε</span>) This particle implies that the attempt is an easy one.—<span class="greekheb">ψηλαφήσειαν</span>, if haply [as well they might] <span class="ital">they might feel after</span>) This is a middle term between <span class="ital">seek</span> and <span class="ital">find</span>.

But it is especially used of the action of the blind groping or feeling their way by their hands in default of sight. So Homer describes Polyphemus as <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, feeling his way to the mouth of the cave with his hands after he was blinded by Ulysses ('Odyssey,' 9:416). And in the LXX. of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a> we read, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "Thou shall grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness." The teaching, therefore, of the passage is that, though God was very near to every man, and had not left himself without abundant witness in his manifold gifts, yet, through the blindness of the heathen, they had to feel their way uncertainly toward God. In this fact lies the need of a revelation, as it follows ver. 30, etc. And hence part at least of the significance of such passages as, "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord" (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>); "Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a> ); "God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>), and many more like passages. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Might feel after<p>See on handle, <a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>.
