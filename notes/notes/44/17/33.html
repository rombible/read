being himself astonished, no doubt, that men who professed wisdom were so little able to discern truth. <span class="ital">Howbeit, certain men clave unto him </span>— And inquired further into the evidence of that extraordinary doctrine which he taught concerning Jesus and his resurrection; the consequence of which was, that they believed the gospel, and made a public and courageous confession of it. <span class="ital">Among </span>whom <span class="ital">was Dionysius the Areopagite </span>— One of the judges of that court; <span class="ital">and a woman named Damaris </span>— One of considerable rank and character in the city; <span class="ital">and others with them </span>— Whose names it is not necessary here to mention. These, it seems, were the only persons Paul met with in this famous mart of learning, capable of seeing and acknowledging the absurdity of the prevailing idolatry! It is not said that Paul wrought any miracles at Athens; and the little success with which he preached, gives reason to suppose that he wrought none. Doubtless, this was by divine appointment, and probably to try what reception the gospel would meet with from learned and inquisitive men, when offered to them merely on the footing of its own reasonableness. The truth is, if such an experiment was anywhere to be made, in order to confute those in after times who should affirm that the general reception of the gospel, in the first stage, was owing not to miracles, but to the absurdities of heathenism, and to the reasonableness of the gospel doctrine, Athens surely was the place where the trial could be made with most advantage, and Paul’s oration in the Areopagus was the discourse which should have convinced reasonable men. Nevertheless, at Athens, where the human faculties were carried to the greatest perfection, the apostle was not able to convince his hearers of the folly of idolatry, nor of the reasonableness of worshipping and serving the one living and true God, by purity of mind and goodness of life! <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:32-34 The apostle was treated with more outward civility at Athens than in some other places; but none more despised his doctrine, or treated it with more indifference. Of all subjects, that which deserves the most attention gains the least. But those who scorn, will have to bear the consequences, and the word will never be useless. Some will be found, who cleave to the Lord, and listen to his faithful servants. Considering the judgement to come, and Christ as our Judge, should urge all to repent of sin, and turn to Him. Whatever matter is used, all discourses must lead to Him, and show his authority; our salvation, and resurrection, come from and by Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So Paul departed - Seeing there was little hope of saving them.

As it was high time, when they fell to deriding and scoffing at him; for hereby they judged themselves unworthy of the Gospel ministry: the Ethiopic version adds, "from Athens"; but it does not appear that the apostle went directly out of the city; we read afterwards of his departing from Athens, <a href="/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a> but the sense is, that he went out of the Areopagus, from that court of judicature; and from among the judges of it, and the philosophers of every sect, that stood around him in it; they having no more to say to him, nor he to them. And this shows, that he was not brought to be tried and judged, in order to be punished, but only to be heard concerning his doctrine; of which, when they had heard enough, he departed quietly, no one molesting him, unless with scoffs and jeers. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So Paul departed from among them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/acts/17-33.htm" title="So Paul departed from among them....">Acts 17:33-34</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὕτως</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">with such a result.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κολληθέντες αὐτῷ</span>] <span class="ital">having more closely attached themselves to him.</span> Comp. <a href="/acts/5-13.htm" title="And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.">Acts 5:13</a>, <a href="/acts/9-26.htm" title="And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.">Acts 9:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ Ἀρεοπαγ</span>.] <span class="ital">the assessor of the court of Areopagus.</span> This is to be considered as the well-known distinctive designation (hence the article) of <span class="ital">this</span> Dionysius in the apostolic church.
