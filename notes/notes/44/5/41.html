But in this case there was something more. The Twelve could not fail to remember their Lord’s beatitudes; and now, for the first time, felt that they could “rejoice and be exceeding glad” because they were suffering as the prophets had suffered before them (<a href="/context/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11-12</a>). And they were suffering for His Name, or rather, with the best MSS., “for <span class= "ital">the</span> Name”—for that of the Master who had loved them and whom they had learnt to love. We may note, too, in the whole history, the fulfilment of the prediction and the promise of <a href="/context/matthew/10-17.htm" title="But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;">Matthew 10:17-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a></span>. <span class="ital">And they departed from the presence of the council </span>— As soon as they were dismissed, not in the least terrified by the cruel usage they had met with, nor by the threatenings of their adversaries. See the power of the grace of God! These are the men who forsook Christ when the soldiers came to apprehend him, not daring to be seen in his company: yet now they profess his name, and abide by their profession, though they are derided and beaten for it. And we do not find that they said one word by way of reflection upon the court, for the unjust treatment given them: <span class="ital">when reviled they reviled not again, and when they suffered they threatened not; </span>but committed their cause to him, to whom Gamaliel had referred it, even to <span class="ital">God, who judgeth righteously. </span>All their care was to preserve the possession of their own souls, and to make full proof of their ministry, both which they were enabled to do in a manner worthy of the imitation of all ministers and people who may, at any time, be in similar circumstances. Nay, they departed, <span class="ital">rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame </span>— Being men in reputation, who had never done any thing to make themselves vile, they could not but have a sense of the shame they suffered, which, it seems, was more grievous to them than the smart caused by the scourges, as uses to be the case with ingenuous minds. But they considered that it was for the name of Christ that they were thus abused, and that their sufferings would be made to contribute to the further advancement of his cause and glory; and, therefore, 1st, They reckoned it an honour to be so treated, to be disgraced, or exposed to infamy <span class="ital">for his name </span>— His venerable and sacred name; rightly judging that a punishment of this kind, though generally shameful, became a glory to them when borne in so excellent a cause, and for the sake of him who, though so divinely great, and so perfectly happy, had submitted, not only to stripes, but to death for them. 2d, They <span class="ital">rejoiced </span>in it, remembering what their Master had said to them at their first setting out, <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.">Matthew 5:13</a>; <span class="ital">When men shall revile and persecute you, rejoice and be exceeding glad. </span>They rejoiced not only <span class="ital">though they suffered shame, </span>their troubles not diminishing their joy, but <span class="ital">that they suffered shame, </span>for their troubles increased their joy, and added to it.

Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rejoicing - Nothing to most people would seem more disgraceful than a public whipping. It is a punishment inflicted usually not so much because it gives "pain," as because it is esteemed to be attended with disgrace. The Jewish rulers doubtless desired that the apostles might be so affected with the sense of this disgrace as to be unwilling to appear again in public, or to preach the gospel anymore. Yet in this they were disappointed. The effect was just the reverse. If it be asked why they rejoiced in this manner, we may reply:<p>(1) Because they were permitted thus to imitate the example of the Lord Jesus. He had been scourged and reviled, and they were glad that they were permitted to be treated as he was. Compare <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>, "Rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings."<p>(2) because, by this, they had evidence that they were the friends and followers of Christ. It was clear they were engaged in the same cause that he was. They were enduring the same sufferings, and striving to advance the same interests. As they loved the "cause," they would rejoice in enduring even the shame and sufferings which the cause, of necessity, involved. The kingdom of the Redeemer was an object so transcendently important, that for it they were willing to endure all the afflictions and disgrace which it might involve.<p>(3) they had been told to "expect" this, and they now rejoiced that they had This evidence that they were engaged in the cause of truth. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17</a>, <a href="/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>; <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a>.<p>(4) Religion appears to a Christian so excellent and lovely, that he is willing, for its sake, to endure trial, persecution, and death. With "all" this, it is infinite gain; and we should be willing to endure these trials, if, by them, we may gain a crown of glory. Compare <a href="/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a>.<p>(5) Christians are the professed friends of Christ. We show attachment for friends by being willing to suffer for them; to bear contempt and reproach on their account; and to share "their" persecutions, sorrows, and calamities.<p>(6) the apostles were engaged in a cause of innocence, truth, and benevolence. They had "done" nothing of which to be ashamed; and they rejoiced, therefore, in a conscience void of offence, and in the consciousness of integrity and benevolence. When other people "disgrace" themselves by harsh, or vile, or opprobrious language or conduct toward "us," we should not feel that the disgrace belongs to "us." It is "theirs"; and we should not be ashamed or distressed, though their rage should fall on us. See <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14-16</a>.<p>Counted worthy - Esteemed to be deserving. That is, esteemed "fit" for it "by the Sanhedrin." It does not mean that "God" esteemed them worthy, but that the Jewish council judged them fit to suffer shame in this cause. They evinced so much zeal and determination of purpose that they were judged fit objects to be treated as the Lord Jesus had himself been.<p>To suffer shame - To be "dishonored" or "disgraced" in the estimation of the Jewish rulers. The "particular" disgrace to which reference is made here was "whipping." To various other kinds of shame they were also exposed. They were persecuted, reviled, and finally put to death. Here we may remark that a profession of the Christian religion has been in all ages esteemed by many to be a "disgrace." The "reasons" are:<p>(1) That Jesus is himself despised;<p>(2) That his precepts are opposed to the gaiety and follies of the world;<p>(3) That it attacks that on which the people of the world pride themselves;<p>(4) That it requires a "spirit" which the world esteems mean and grovelling - meekness, humility, self-denial, patience, forgiveness of injuries; and,<p>(5) That it requires "duties" - prayer, praise, seriousness, benevolence. All these things the people of the world esteem degrading and mean, and hence, they endeavor to subject those who practice them to disgrace. The "kinds" of disgrace to which Christians have been subjected are too numerous to be mentioned here. In former times they were subjected to the loss of property, of reputation, and to all the shame of public punishment, and to the terrors of the dungeon, the stake, or the rack. One main design of persecution was to select a kind of punishment so "disgraceful" as to deter others from professing religion. Disgrace even yet may attend it. It may subject one to the ridicule of friends - of even a father, mother, or brother. Christians hear their opinions abused; their names vilified; their Bible travestied; the name of their God profaned, and of their Redeemer blasphemed. Their feelings are often wantonly and rudely torn by the cutting sarcasm or the bitter sneer. Books and songs revile them; their specialties are made the occasion of indecent merriment on the stage and in novels; and in this way they are still subjected to shame for the name of Jesus. Every one who becomes a Christian should remember that this is a part of his inheritance, and should not esteem it dishonorable to be treated as his Master was before him, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-25.htm">Matthew 10:25</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. departed &#8230; rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name&#8212;"thought worthy by God to be dishonored by man" (Mt 5:12; 1Pe 4:14, 16) [Webster and Wilkinson].
