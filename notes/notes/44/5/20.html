Recoveries from sickness, releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of our life. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in the great congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are as precious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for all are concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live and die by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, in comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the name. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth. The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may be saved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of the gospel!

Their deliverance from prison was not that they might be idle, and escape to a place of safety. Again they were to engage in the toils and perils which they had just before encountered. God delivers us from dangers sometimes that we may plunge "into" new dangers; he preserves us from one form of calamity that we may be tried in some new furnace of affliction; he calls us to encounter trials simply "because" he demands it, and as an expression of gratitude to him for his gracious interposition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. all the words of this life&#8212;beautiful expression for that Life in the Risen One which was the burden of their preaching!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Stand; </span> the word implies courage and stedfastness of mind, as well as such a posture of the body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the words; </span> without preferring some acceptable truths before others more ungrateful, if necessary towards their salvation.
