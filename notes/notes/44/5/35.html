Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then stood there up one - He rose, as is usual in deliberative assemblies, to speak.<p>In the council - In the Sanhedrin, <a href="/acts/4-15.htm">Acts 4:15</a>.<p>A Pharisee - The high priest and those who had been most active in opposing the apostles were Sadducees. The Pharisees were opposed to them, particularly on the doctrine in regard to which the apostles were so strenuous, the resurrection of the dead. See the notes on <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>. Compare <a href="/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>.<p>Gamaliel - This name was very common among the Jews. Dr. Lightfoot says that this man was the teacher of Paul <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>, the son of the "Simon" who took the Saviour in his arms <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2.htm">Luke 2</a>, and the grandson of the famous "Hillel," and was known among the Jews by the title of "Rabban Gamaliel the elder." There were other people of this name, who were also eminent among the Jews. This man is said to have died 18 years after the destruction of Jerusalem, and he died as he had lived, a Pharisee. There is not the least evidence that he was a friend of the Christian religion; but he was evidently a man of far more liberal views than the other members of the Sanhedrin.<p>A doctor of the law - That is, "a teacher" of the Jewish Law; one whose province it was to "interpret" the laws of Moses, and probably to preserve and transmit the "traditional" laws of the Jews. See the notes on <a href="/matthew/15-3.htm">Matthew 15:3</a>. So celebrated was he, that Saul of Tarsus went to Jerusalem to receive the benefit of his instructions, <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>.<p>Had in reputation among all the people - "Honored" by all the people. His advice was likely, therefore, to be respected.<p>To put the apostles forth - This was done, doubtless, because, if the apostles had been suffered to remain, it was apprehended that they would take fresh courage, and be confirmed in their purposes. It was customary, besides, when they deliberated, to command those accused to retire, <a href="/acts/4-15.htm">Acts 4:15</a>.<p>A little space - A little "time," <a href="/luke/22-58.htm">Luke 22:58</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35-39.

This he said after the apostles were put out, when the council was by themselves; and he addressed them as "men of Israel"; not as distinct from the priests and Levites in the council, but because they were all of the stock of Israel; for this council did not consist of Israelites only, as distinct from priests and Levites, as appears from <a href="/acts/5-21.htm">Acts 5:21</a>. A sanhedrim commonly consisted of each of these; though if only of Israelites it was a lawful one. Maimonides says (c), <p>"they did not use to appoint any in the sanhedrim, but priests, Levites, and Israelites, that were genealogized and fit to be married into the priesthood---and that it was a command, that in the great sanhedrim there should be priests and Levites; as it is said, "thou shalt go to the priests and Levites"; but if they are not found, if they are all Israelites, lo, this is lawful,'' <p>or a proper sanhedrim. His speech to them follows, <p>take heed to yourselves; consider well, do not act a rash and precipitant part; do not give way to passion and wrath, and hastily lay hands on these men, and destroy them; lest ye bring yourselves into disgrace and danger, and bring upon yourselves the ill-will and resentment of men, and the wrath of God: take time to consider of the matter, and deliberately consult <p>what ye intend to do as touching these men; what punishment to inflict upon them, whether imprisonment, scourging, or death; do nothing rashly. <p>(c) Hilchot Sanhedrin, c. 2. sect. 1. 2. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀυθρώπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τούτοις</span>] <span class="ital">in respect of these men</span> (Bernhardy, p. 251) might be joined to <span class="greekheb">προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς</span> (Lachm.), as Luther, Castalio, Beza, and many others have done (whence also comes the reading <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. in E); yet the currency of the expression <span class="greekheb">πράσσειν τι ἐπί τινι</span> (Wolf and Kuinoel <span class="ital">in loc.</span>, Matthiae, p. 927) is in favour of its being construed with <span class="greekheb">τί μέλλετε πράσσειν</span>.

After what has been said on the character of all the speeches, that they make no attempt to set before us all that was said on each occasion, but only the substance of what St Luke had received from eye and ear-witnesses, it can in no wise detract from the substantial veracity of all that is reported, if we find the compiler of the Acts, who was himself a Greek, giving the usual Greek form of introduction to the speeches of which he has shewn so often that he intends to supply only an outline.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">take heed to yourselves</span>] The phrase implies that thought is required before any action be taken.
