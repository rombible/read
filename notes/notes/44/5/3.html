He had that prophetic gift which gave him insight into the hearts of men, and through this outward show of generous devotion he read the baseness and the lie. And that evil he traced to its fountain-head. Like the sin of Judas (<a href="/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a>; <a href="/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27</a>), it had in it a malignant subtlety of evil, which implied the perversion of conscience and will just at the moment when they seemed to be, and, it may be, actually were, on the point of attaining a higher perfection than before. The question “why” implies that resistance to the temptation had been possible. Had he resisted the Tempter, he would have fled from him (<a href="/james/4-7.htm" title="Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.">James 4:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To lie to the Holy Ghost.</span>—The words admit of two tenable interpretations. Ananias may be said to “have lied unto the Holy Ghost,” either (1) as lying against Him who dwelt in the Apostles whom he was seeking to deceive; or (2) as against Him who was the Searcher of the secrets of all hearts, his own included, and who was “grieved” (<a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>) by this resistance in one who had been called to a higher life. The apparent parallelism of the clause in <a href="/acts/5-4.htm" title="Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.">Acts 5:4</a> is in favour of (1); but there is in the Greek a distinction, obviously made deliberately, between the structure of the verb in the two sentences. Here it is used with the accusative of the direct object, so that the meaning is “to cheat or deceive the Holy Spirit;” there with the dative, “to speak a lie, not to men, but to God;” and this gives a sense which is at least compatible with (2). The special intensity of the sin consisted in its being against the light and knowledge with which the human spirit had been illumined by the divine. The circumstance that it was also an attempt to deceive those in whom that Spirit dwelt in the fulness of its power comes in afterwards as a secondary aggravation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/5-3.htm" title="But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?...">Acts 5:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">But Peter said </span>— Under the direction of the Holy Spirit, which immediately suggested to him the fraud; <span class="ital">Why has Satan </span>— Through thine own wickedness in yielding to his temptations; <span class="ital">filled thy heart </span>— With such a degree of covetousness, falsehood, folly, and presumption, as to induce thee <span class="ital">to lie to, </span>or, as Dr. Waterland renders <span class="greekheb">ψευσασθαι σε το πνευμα το αγιον</span>, <span class="ital">to put a fallacy, </span>or <span class="ital">cheat upon the Holy Ghost; </span>that is, that thou shouldst attempt to impose upon the Spirit of God, namely, the Spirit with which the apostles were endued. Here we see St. Peter, under the infallible guidance of the Spirit of truth, of wisdom, and revelation, acknowledging and bearing testimony to the agency of Satan in exciting men to and promoting wickedness: and what faith then have they in the inspiration of the apostles, who call in question the very existence of the devil, and even venture to give it as their opinion that there is no such being in the universe? <span class="ital">And to keep back part of the price </span>— When thou pretendest to have brought the whole. <span class="ital">While it remained </span>unsold, <span class="ital">was it not thine own? </span>— It evidently appears from hence, that no Christian converts were obliged to sell their estates. <span class="ital">And when it was sold, was it not </span>still <span class="ital">in thine own power </span>— To have given, or not given, the whole or any part of the price of it into the treasury of the church, as thou shouldest think proper? <span class="ital">Why </span>then <span class="ital">hast thou conceived this thing, </span>&c. — So meanly and profanely to dissemble on this solemn occasion? <span class="ital">Thou hast not lied unto men — </span>That is, to men alone, whose treasurers we are; <span class="ital">but unto God </span>— Who resides in us by his Divine Spirit. Hence it is justly inferred, that the Holy Ghost is God; since lying to him is said to be lying to God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-11 The sin of Ananias and Sapphira was, that they were ambitious of being thought eminent disciples, when they were not true disciples. Hypocrites may deny themselves, may forego their worldly advantage in one instance, with a prospect of finding their account in something else. They were covetous of the wealth of the world, and distrustful of God and his providence. They thought they might serve both God and mammon. They thought to deceive the apostles. The Spirit of God in Peter discerned the principle of unbelief reigning in the heart of Ananias. But whatever Satan might suggest, he could not have filled the heart of Ananias with this wickedness had he not been consenting. The falsehood was an attempt to deceive the Spirit of truth, who so manifestly spoke and acted by the apostles. The crime of Ananias was not his retaining part of the price of the land; he might have kept it all, had he pleased; but his endeavouring to impose upon the apostles with an awful lie, from a desire to make a vain show, joined with covetousness. But if we think to put a cheat upon God, we shall put a fatal cheat upon our own souls. How sad to see those relations who should quicken one another to that which is good, hardening one another in that which is evil! And this punishment was in reality mercy to vast numbers. It would cause strict self-examination, prayer, and dread of hypocrisy, covetousness, and vain-glory, and it should still do so. It would prevent the increase of false professors. Let us learn hence how hateful falsehood is to the God of truth, and not only shun a direct lie, but all advantages from the use of doubtful expressions, and double meaning in our speech.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But Peter said ... - Peter could have known this only by "revelation." It was the manifest design of Ananias to deceive; nor was there any way of detecting him but by its being revealed to him by the Spirit of God. As it was an instance of enormous wickedness, and as it was very important to detect and punish the crime, it was made known to Peter directly by God.<p>Why hath Satan - Great deeds of wickedness in the Scripture are traced to the influence of Satan. Compare <a href="/luke/23-3.htm">Luke 23:3</a>; <a href="/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a>. Especially is Satan called the "father of lies," <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44-45</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>. As this was an act of "falsehood," or an attempt to deceive, it is with great propriety traced to the influence of Satan. The sin of Ananias consisted in his "yielding" to the temptation. Nowhere in the Bible are people supposed to be free from guilt from the mere fact that they have been "tempted" to commit it. God requires them to "resist" temptation; and if they "yield" to it, they must be punished.<p>Filled thine heart - A man's "heart" or "mind" is "full" of a thing when he is "intent on it"; when he is strongly "impelled to it"; or when he is fully occupied with it. The expression here means that he was "strongly impelled" or "excited" by Satan to this crime.<p>To lie to - To attempt to deceive. The deception which he meant to practice was to keep back a "part" of the price, while he "pretended" to bring the whole of it; thus "tempting" God, and supposing that he could not detect the fraud.<p>The Holy Ghost - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  to pneuma to hagion. The main inquiry here is, whether the apostle Peter intended to designate in this place the "third person" of the Trinity; or whether he meant to speak of God "as God," without any reference to the distinction of persons; or whether he referred to the "divine influence" which inspired the apostles, without reference to the special offices which are commonly ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Or, in other words, is there a "distinction" here recognized between the Father and the Holy Spirit? That there "is," will be apparent from the following considerations:<p>(1) If no such distinction is "intended," it is remarkable that Peter did not use the usual and customary "name" of God. It does not appear why he guarded it so carefully as to denote that this offence was committed against the "Holy Spirit," and "the Spirit of the Lord," <a href="/acts/5-9.htm">Acts 5:9</a>.<p>(2) the name used here is the one employed in the Scriptures to designate the third person of the Trinity, as implying a distinction from the Father. See <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>; <a href="/mark/12-36.htm">Mark 12:36</a>; <a href="/luke/12-10.htm">Luke 12:10</a>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>; <a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>; <a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>, etc.<p>(3) Peter intended, doubtless, to designate an offence as committed particularly against the person, or influence, by which he and the other apostles were inspired. Ananias supposed that he could escape detection, and the offence was one, therefore, against the Inspirer of the apostles. Yet that was the Holy Spirit as "distinct from the Father." See <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7-11</a>; <a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>. Compare <a href="/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>. The offence, therefore, being against him who was "sent" by the Father, and who was appointed to a particular work, clearly supposes that the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Father.<p>(4) a further incidental proof of this may be found in the fact that the sin here committed was one of special magnitude - so great as to be deemed worthy of the immediate and signal vengeance of God. Yet the sin against the Holy Spirit is uniformly represented to be of this description. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-31.htm">Matthew 12:31-32</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/3-28.htm">Mark 3:28-29</a>. As these sins evidently coincide in enormity, it is clear that the same class of sins is referred to in both places; or, in other words, the sin of Ananias was against the third person of the Trinity. Two remarks may be made here:<p>(1) The Holy Spirit is a distinct Person from the Father and the Son; or, in other words, there is a distinction of some kind in the divine nature that may be designated by the word "person." This is clear from the fact that sin is said to have been committed against him - a sin which it was supposed could not be detected. "Sin" cannot be committed against an "attribute" of God, or an "influence" from God. We cannot "lie unto" an attribute, or against wisdom, or power, or goodness; nor can we "lie unto" an "influence," merely, of the Most High. Sin is committed against a "Being," not against an "attribute"; and as a sin is here charged on Ananias against "the Holy Spirit," it follows that the Holy Spirit has a "personal" existence, or that there is such a distinction in the divine essence that it may be proper to "specify" a sin as committed especially against him. In the same way sin may be represented as committed especially against the "Father" when his "name" is blasphemed; when his "dominion" is denied; when his mercy in sending his Son is called in question. Sin may be represented as committed against "the Son" when his atonement is denied; his divinity assailed; his character derided, or his invitations slighted. And thus sin may be represented as committed against "the Holy Spirit" when his office of renewing the heart, or sanctifying the soul, is called in question, or when "his" work is ascribed to some malign or other influence. See <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22-30</a>. And as sin against the Son proves that he is in some sense distinct from the Father, so does sin against the Holy Spirit prove that in some sense he is distinct from the Father and the Son.<p>(2) the Holy Spirit is divine. This is proved, because he is represented here as being able to search the heart, and to detect insincerity and hypocrisy. Compare <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>, "The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God"; <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>.

We must believe that the Holy Spirit gave Peter knowledge of the deception which Ananias was seeking to practise on the Church, and most likely also of the punishment which should come upon the offender. Otherwise we can hardly account for the calm manner of the Apostle when such a startling judgment was inflicted in an instant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath Satan filled thine heart</span>] i.e. made thee bold enough.

It is much to be noticed how from the first the Apostles disclaim any power in themselves. It is Christ who works the miracles, the God of Abraham who gives the power of healing, and the Holy Ghost who is grieved by sins like that of Ananias. There is no trace of any seeking after consideration for themselves and their deeds among the records of these Acts of the Apostles, and no sign could be more indicative of the earliest age of the Christian Church. Before the apostolic age was past the internal character of the Church was much altered from this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and to keep back part of the price of the land</span>] As before, the sense is that of fraudulent concealment and purloining.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/5-3.htm" title="But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?">Acts 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπλήρωσεν</span>) <span class="ital">hath filled</span>, viz. with audacity and fraud, without there being any resistance made to him on thy part.
