The part he now played in the opening of the great drama, and not less his position as the instructor of St. Paul, demand attention. We have to think of him as the grandson of the great Hillel the representative of the best school of Pharisaism, the tolerant and large-hearted rival of the narrow and fanatic Shammai, whose precepts—such, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as, Do nothing to another which thou wouldest not that he should do to thee—remind us of the Sermon on the Mount. The fame of Hillel won for him the highest honour of Judaism: the title of <span class= "ital">R</span>abban (the <span class= "ital">Rabboni</span> of <a href="/mark/10-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, What will you that I should do to you? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.">Mark 10:51</a>; <a href="/john/20-16.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned herself, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.">John 20:16</a>), and the office of President of the Council. For the first time, there seemed likely to be a dynasty of scribes, and the office of chief of the Jewish schools, what we might almost call their Professorship of Theology, was transmitted through four generations. Hillel was succeeded by his son Simeon, whom some have identified with the Simeon of <a href="/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a> (see Note there), and he by Gamaliel. He, too, was known as the Rabban, and he rose now, with all the weight of years and authority, to counsel moderation. Various motives may have influenced him. He was old enough to remember the wisdom and grace of the child Jesus when, twenty-eight years before, He had sat in the midst of the doctors (<a href="/luke/2-46.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.">Luke 2:46</a>). He may have welcomed, during our Lord’s ministry, the teaching with so much of which Hillel would have sympathised, and been as the scribe who was not far from the kingdom of God (<a href="/context/mark/12-32.htm" title="And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:">Mark 12:32-34</a>), rejoicing in the new proof that had been brought forward of the doctrine of the Resurrection. As being himself of the house and lineage of David, he may have sympathised with the claims of One who was welcomed as the Son of David. One who was so prominent as a teacher could not fail to be acquainted with a brother-teacher like Nicodemus, and may well have been influenced by the example of his gradual conversion and the counsels of caution which he had given (<a href="/context/john/7-50.htm" title="Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)">John 7:50-51</a>). The tone in which he speaks now might almost lead us to class him with the “many” of the chief rulers who secretly believed in Christ, but shrank from confessing Him (<a href="/context/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42-43</a>). It seems probable that he, like Joseph of Arimathæa, had “not consented to the counsel and deed” of the Sanhedrin which Caiaphas had hastily convened for our Lord’s trial, and had contented himself with a policy of absence and expectation. If, as seems probable, Saul of Tarsus was at this time one of his disciples (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>), the words of warning, though addressed generally to the Council, may well have been intended specially to restrain his fiery and impetuous zeal.<p><span class= "bld">Commanded to put the apostles forth a little space.</span>—The practice of thus deliberating in the absence of the accused seems to have been common. (Comp. <a href="/acts/4-15.htm" title="But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,">Acts 4:15</a>.) The report of the speech that follows may have come to St. Luke from some member of the Council, or, probably enough, from St. Paul himself. The occasional coincidences of language with the writings of that Apostle tend to confirm the antecedent likelihood of the conjecture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/5-34.htm" title="Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;...">Acts 5:34-37</a>. </span><span class="ital">Then stood up one in the council, a Pharisee </span>— And as such believing the immortality of the soul and the resurrection; <span class="ital">named Gamaliel — </span>He is said to have been the son of good old Simeon, mentioned <a href="/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>; and the person at whose feet St. Paul was brought up. He was a man in so great esteem among the Jews, that Onkelos, the author of the Targum, is said to have burned seventy pounds weight of perfumes at his funeral; and the Jews have this saying concerning him: “From the time that Rabban Gamaliel, the old, died, the honour of the law failed, and purity and Pharisaism died.” <span class="ital">A doctor </span>— Or teacher; <span class="ital">of the law </span>— Who trained up a great number of pupils in the knowledge of it; <span class="ital">had in reputation among all the people </span>— Except the Sadducees. Thus can God raise up defenders of his servants whensoever and wheresoever he pleases. This man, rising up, <span class="ital">commanded to put the apostles forth a little space </span>— That he might speak the more freely, and be the more freely answered. <span class="ital">And said, Ye men of Israel </span>— To whom Divine Providence has committed the guardianship of this people, and the important care of their public affairs; <span class="ital">take heed to yourselves </span>— Now you are angry at these men; <span class="ital">what ye intend to do </span>— Lest you meddle to your own hurt. He puts them in mind of the importance of the matter in hand, which, in their heat, they were not capable of considering as they ought. <span class="ital">For before these days rose up Theudas </span>— He prudently mentions the facts first, and then draws the inference. A person of the name of Theudas is mentioned by Josephus, (<span class="ital">Antiq., <a href="/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a></span>,) under the character of a false prophet, who drew a great number of people after him, with a promise of dividing Jordan before them, but was defeated and beheaded, most of his followers being also slain or imprisoned. See notes on <a href="/matthew/24-5.htm" title="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:5</a>. But as this person appeared when Fadus was procurator of Judea, that is, according to Capellus, seven, or, according to Whitby, at least ten years after this was spoken, there can be no reference to him here. But Theudas being a very common name among the Jews, the person here mentioned, most probably, was one among the many leaders, who, as Josephus informs us, took up arms in defence of the public liberties, when the grand enrolment was made by Cyrenius, in the days of Archelaus. See note on <a href="/luke/2-17.htm" title="And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.">Luke 2:17</a>. This Theudas seems to have been supported by smaller numbers than the second of the name; and (as the second afterward did) perished in the attempt; but as his followers were dispersed, and not slaughtered like those of the second Theudas, survivers might talk much of him, and Gamaliel might have been particularly informed of his history, though Josephus only mentions it in general. <span class="ital">After this man rose up Judas of Galilee </span>— Of whom see note on <a href="/context/luke/13-1.htm" title="There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices....">Luke 13:1-2</a>; <span class="ital">in the days of the taxing </span>— Or, as <span class="greekheb">εν ταις ημεραις της απογραφης </span>signifies, <span class="ital">in the days of the taxation, </span>or <span class="ital">enrolment; </span>meaning those same days, or at the same period of time, when the impostor Theudas appeared; <span class="ital">and drew away much people after him </span>— Endeavouring, on the principles of sacred liberty, to dissuade the Jews from owning the authority of the Romans in that instance; <span class="ital">he also perished</span> — Was quickly destroyed; <span class="ital">and as many as obeyed him </span>— As hearkened to, and followed him; <span class="ital">were dispersed </span>— And their cause came to nothing.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:34-42 The Lord still has all hearts in his hands, and sometimes directs the prudence of the worldly wise, so as to restrain the persecutors. Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then stood there up one - He rose, as is usual in deliberative assemblies, to speak.<p>In the council - In the Sanhedrin, <a href="/acts/4-15.htm">Acts 4:15</a>.<p>A Pharisee - The high priest and those who had been most active in opposing the apostles were Sadducees. The Pharisees were opposed to them, particularly on the doctrine in regard to which the apostles were so strenuous, the resurrection of the dead.

There were other people of this name, who were also eminent among the Jews. This man is said to have died 18 years after the destruction of Jerusalem, and he died as he had lived, a Pharisee. There is not the least evidence that he was a friend of the Christian religion; but he was evidently a man of far more liberal views than the other members of the Sanhedrin.<p>A doctor of the law - That is, "a teacher" of the Jewish Law; one whose province it was to "interpret" the laws of Moses, and probably to preserve and transmit the "traditional" laws of the Jews. See the notes on <a href="/matthew/15-3.htm">Matthew 15:3</a>. So celebrated was he, that Saul of Tarsus went to Jerusalem to receive the benefit of his instructions, <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>.<p>Had in reputation among all the people - "Honored" by all the people. His advice was likely, therefore, to be respected.<p>To put the apostles forth - This was done, doubtless, because, if the apostles had been suffered to remain, it was apprehended that they would take fresh courage, and be confirmed in their purposes.

Or "in the sanhedrim", which the high priest had called together; this phrase is left out in the Syriac version: yet certain it is, that the great council was now assembled, and the disciples were now before them, and this man, who was one of the members of it, stood up in it; for it seems to have been the custom, that though they usually sat, yet when anyone had anything to say, or made a speech, he rose up from his seat. <p>A Pharisee named Gamaliel; he is described by his sect of religion, a Pharisee; of which; see Gill on <a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a> and by his name Gamaliel: he was the son of Rabban Simeon, the son of Hillell the great; which Simeon is, by some, thought to be the same that took Christ into his arms, <a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a> and this Gamaliel was also the master of the Apostle Paul, <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>. This was a very ancient name in Israel; the prince of the children of Manasseh, that offered at the dedication of the tabernacle, was of this name, <a href="/numbers/7-54.htm">Numbers 7:54</a> and perhaps this man might be of the same tribe. He is further described by his profession, <p>a doctor of law; he was one of the Misnic doctors, one of the fathers of tradition, that received the oral law from those before him, and handed it down to others; and was the five and thirtieth of this sort, as the Jews say (t), from the giving of the law at Mount Sinai; or, as others (u), the thirty first: <p>had in reputation among all the people; and therefore his advice was the more likely to take place, without giving offence, or exposing to danger, seeing he was highly esteemed, not only in the sanhedrim, but among the common people; and that not only because he was a Pharisee, and a very strict one, the glory of that sect, insomuch that it is said (w), that <p>"when he died, the glory of the law ceased, and purity and pharisaism died;'' <p>but because of his years, dignity, and place also; he is called commonly Gamaliel,  "the elder", because he lived to a great age (x). He died eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem (y), and was had in veneration to the last. It is said of him (z), that <p>"he ordered, before his death, that they should carry him to his grave in linen; for before this time they used to carry out the dead in silk; and this was more grievous to his relations than his death itself;'' <p>because they thought he was not interred honourably enough. And it is also reported, that Onkelos, the proselyte, at his death, burnt as much for him in goods and spices, as came to seventy Tyrian pounds (a). He was also commonly called by the name of Rabban, which was a more honourable title than that of Rabbi or Rab; and his father Simeon was the first that had it (b); and he was now president of the sanhedrim: and hence he used that authority which is expressed in the next words, <p>and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; he ordered the apostles to be put out of the sanhedrim for a little while, that they might not hear what he had to say, and take encouragement from it; and that he might more freely speak his mind without giving them any countenance. The Alexandrian copy reads, "the men", instead of "the apostles"; and so the Vulgate Latin version. <p>(t) Ganz Tzemach David, par. 1. fol. 25. 2.((u) Juchasin, fol. 20. 1.((w) Misn.

Simeon,—a view which cannot be proved, but also cannot be refuted, as there is nothing against it in a chronological point of view (Lightf. Hor. ad Matth. p. 33). He was the teacher of the Apostle Paul (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>), but is certainly not in our passage to be considered as the president of the Sanhedrim, as many have assumed, because in that case Luke would have designated him more characteristically than by <span class="greekheb">τις ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνεδρίῳ Φαρισ</span>. That he had been in secret a Christian (see already Recogn. Clem. i. 65; Beda, Cornelius a Lapide), and been baptized, along with his son and Nicodemus, by Peter and John (Phot. cod. 171, p. 199), is a legend deduced by arbitrary inference from this passage. See Thilo, ad Cod. apocr. p. 501. An opposite but equally arbitrary extreme is the opinion of Pearson (Lectt. p. 49), that Gamaliel only declared himself in favour of the apostles from an inveterate partisan opposition to the Sadducees. Still more grossly, Schrader, II. p. 63, makes him a hypocrite, who sought to act merely for his own elevation and for the kingdom of darkness, and to win the unsuspicious Christians by his dissimulation. He was not a mere prudent waiter on events (Thiersch), but a wise, impartial, humane, and religiously scrupulous man, so strong in character that he could not and would not suppress the warnings and counsels that experience prompted him to oppose to the passionate zeal, backed in great part by Sadducean prejudice, of his colleagues (<a href="/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>); and therefore to be placed higher than an ordinary jurist and politician dispassionately contemplating the case (Ewald). Recently it has been maintained that the emergence of Gamaliel here recorded is an unhistorical rôle (Baur) assigned to him (see also Zeller); and the chief[172] ground alleged for this view is the mention of Theudas, <a href="/acts/5-36.htm" title="For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.">Acts 5:36</a> (but see on <a href="/acts/5-36.htm" title="For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.">Acts 5:36</a>), while there is further assumed the set purpose of making Christianity a section of orthodox, or in other words Pharisaic Judaism, combated by Sadducaeism. As if, after the exaltation of Christ, His resurrection must not really have stood in the foreground of the apostles’ preaching! and by that very fact the position of parties <span class="ital">could not but</span> necessarily be so far changed, that now the main interests of <span class="ital">Sadducaeism</span> were most deeply affected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νομοδιδάσκαλος</span>] a <span class="greekheb">νομικός</span>, one skilled in the law (canonist) as a <span class="ital">teacher</span>.

But whatever may have been the extent of his liberality, Gamaliel remained firmly attached to the traditions of the fathers, and whilst we may see in his recorded principle his abhorrence of wrangling and over-scrupulosity, we may also see in it a proof of his adherence to traditionalism: “Procure thyself a teacher, avoid being in doubt; and do not accustom thyself to give tithes by guess” (Edersheim, <span class="ital">History of the Jewish Nation</span>, p. 128). But in itself there is nothing strange in the fact that Saul should surpass the zeal of Gamaliel, for not only does history often show us how one side of the teaching of a master may be exaggerated to excess by a pupil, but also the specific charge against Stephen of destroying the Temple and of changing the customs of Moses had not been formulated against St. Peter and his brother-Apostles, who still attended the Temple worship, and whose piety gained them the regard of the people. That charge against the first martyr was nothing less than the charge brought against Jesus of Nazareth: the burning words and scathing denunciations of Stephen could only be answered, as those of Jesus had been answered, by the counter charge of blasphemy, and the punishment of death (see Sabatier’s <span class="ital">L’Apôtre Paul</span>, 21 ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Gamaliel appears as an ordinary member, and there can be no reasonable doubt that the high priest was always the President during the Roman-Herodian period. Not until after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the priesthood had lost its importance, was a Rabbi chosen as President of a reconstituted Sanhedrim. For a summary of the views for and against the Rabbinic tradition that this Gamaliel was the President of the Sanhedrim, see Appendix iii., “The President of the Sanhedrim,” by the late Rev. H. A. White, in Dr. Edersheim’s <span class="ital">History of the Jewish Nation</span>, p. 522 ff. The influence of Gamaliel may easily be understood (1) when we remember that whilst the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεῖς</span> belonged chiefly if not exclusively to the Sadducees, the Pharisees who also had seats in the Sanhedrim (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.">Acts 23:6</a>, and Jos., <span class="ital">B. J.</span>, ii., 17, 3, <span class="ital">Vita</span>, 38, 39, <span class="ital">C. Apion</span>, ii., 22) possessed <span class="ital">practically</span> a predominating influence in the Council. The remark of Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xviii., 1, 4, gives us, as Schürer says, “a deep insight into the actual position of matters,” Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. i., p. 178 ff., E.T., and O. Holtzmann <span class="ital">Neutest. Zeitgeschichte</span>, p. 175. (2) But we have also to take into account the personal influence of the man, which was no doubt at its height about the time described in Acts 5—he died A.D. 57–58. Not only was he the first teacher of the seven to whom the title Rabban was given (higher than that of Rab or Rabbi), but Jewish tradition respecting him shows the dignity and influence which attached to his name, Hamburger, <span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie des Judentums</span>, ii., 2, 236, and see on the titles given to Gamaliel, Derenbourg, <span class="ital">Histoire de la Palestine</span>, pp. 239–246, and Schürer, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 364. We may see a further proof of his influence in the fact that a certain proviso with regard to the determining leap year, which was passed in the Sanhedrim in his absence, was only to come into force if it received the confirmation of Gamaliel (<span class="ital">Edajoth</span>, vii., 7). So far then St. Luke’s account of the weight which would be carried by Gamaliel in the assembly is amply justified, and Schürer’s description of the constitution of the Sanhedrim, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 174 ff., is sufficient reply to the strictures of Jüngst against Gamaliel’s appearance as a member of the Council, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Derenbourg, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, pp. 201, 213.

He is known in Jewish writings as Gamaliel ha-Zaken (i.e. the older), and was the grandson of Hillel. He was alive during the time when Herod was beautifying the Temple. For in <span class="ital">Tosephta Shabbath</span> xiv. (<span class="ital">ed.

Rabbi Khalaphta said to him, I remember concerning Rabban Gamaliel the elder, the father of thy father, that he was sitting on a step in the Temple mount, and they brought before him the book of Job, in Targum, and he said to the builder, “Sink it (bury it) under this course of the wall.” This could only have been when the walls were in building.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Gamaliel is said to have died 18 years before the Temple was destroyed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In T.

St. Luke had mentioned (<a href="/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1</a> and Acts 5:17) that there was an influential party of Sadducees in the Sanhedrim. He, therefore, now specially notes that Gamaliel was a Pharisee. There can be no doubt that this alone would rather dispose him to resist the violent counsels of the Sadducean members, and the more so as the doctrine of the Resurrection was in question (see <a href="/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6-8</a>). Moreover, Gamaliel was noted for his moderation. That <span class="accented">Gamaliel</span> here named is the same as that of <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>, at whose feet St. Paul was brought up at Jerusalem, and who is known in the Talmud as Rabban Gamaliel the elder (to distinguish him from his grandson of the same name, the younger), the grandson of Hillel, the head of the school of Hillel, and at some time president of the Sanhedrim, one of the most famous of the Jewish doctors (as the title <span class="accented">Rabban</span>, borne by only six others, shows), seems certain, though it cannot absolutely be proved. The description of him as <span class="cmt_word">a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people;</span> the allusion to him as a great teacher, learned in the perfect manner of the Law of the fathers, and one whose greatness would be as a shield to his pupils, in <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; the exact chronological agreement; the weight he possessed in the Sanhedrim, in spite of the Sadducean tendencies of the high priest and his followers; and the agreement between his character as written in the Talmud and as shown in his speech and in the counsel given in it, seem to place his identity beyond all reasonable doubt. There does not seem to be any foundation for the legend in the Clementine Recognitions, that he was in secret a Christian. If the prayer used in the synagogues, "Let there be no hope to them that apostatize from the true religion; and let heretics, how many soever they he, all perish as in a moment," be really his composition, as the Jews say, he certainly had no inclination to Christianity ('Prid.
