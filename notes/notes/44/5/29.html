<span class="ital">said </span>— He does not give them the titles of honour which he did before; (<a href="/acts/4-8.htm" title="Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them, You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,">Acts 4:8</a>;) but enters directly upon the subject, and justifies what he and his brethren had done. This is, as it were, a continuation of that discourse, but with an increase of severity; <span class="ital">We ought to obey God rather than men </span>— They do not plead the power they had to work miracles; a power which spoke sufficiently for them, and proved their divine mission; and therefore, they humbly declined mentioning it themselves: but appealed to a maxim universally owned, to which even reason must subscribe, and which was a perfect justification of their conduct; God had commanded them to teach in the name of Christ, and therefore they were in duty bound to do it, though the chief priests forbade them. <span class="ital">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus </span>— Of the seed of David, according to the promises made to our fathers; that is, he qualified him for, and called him to, his great undertaking. It seems to refer to the promise made by Moses. See <a href="/acts/3-22.htm" title="For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.">Acts 3:22</a>. Or, he may speak of God’s raising him from the grave. <span class="ital">Whom ye slew and hanged on a tree </span>— As if he had been the meanest of slaves, and the vilest of malefactors. You put him to death in the most infamous manner; but God has restored him to life; so that God and you are manifestly contesting about this Jesus, and which must we side with? <span class="ital">Him </span>— This very person, notwithstanding all the outrage with which you treated him; <span class="ital">hath God exalted with his right hand</span> — By his almighty power, from the grave to heaven; or, <span class="ital">to his right hand. </span>You loaded him with disgrace; but God has crowned him with honour; and ought not we to honour him whom God honours? <span class="ital">A Prince and a Saviour</span> — To his people, whom he both governs and delivers, and therefore we ought to preach in his name, and make known the laws of his kingdom, as he is a Prince; and the offers of his grace, as he is a Saviour. Observe, reader, we cannot have Christ to be our <span class="ital">Saviour, </span>unless we be willing to take him for our <span class="ital">Ruler. </span>We cannot be redeemed and healed by him, unless we give up ourselves to be governed by him. His saving us is in order to his ruling us. <span class="ital">To give repentance to Israel </span>— To give the people of Israel place or room for repentance, notwithstanding their aggravated guilt; and to declare unto them the terms of peace and reconciliation: or, to call them to repentance by the gospel, and give them grace to enable them to obey the call; <span class="ital">and forgiveness of sins </span>— To all the truly penitent, on whom alone that blessing is bestowed: for there is no remission without repentance; none are freed from the guilt and punishment of sin, but those who are freed from the power and dominion of it; that are turned from it to God. And on the other hand, wherever repentance takes place, accompanied with fruits worthy of repentance, and faith in Christ, and in the promises of God through him, remission is granted without fail. Some infer from hence, that repentance and faith are as mere gifts of God, as remission of sins. Not so: for man co-operates in the former, but not in the latter. God alone forgives sins. <span class="ital">And we are his witnesses of these things — </span>How incredible soever they may appear to you, and are appointed by him to publish them to the world: and if we should be silent, as you would have us to be, we should be false to, and betray, a trust of the greatest possible importance; <span class="ital">and so is also the Holy Ghost </span>— A much greater witness, a witness from heaven; <span class="ital">whom God hath given </span>— In his gifts, as well as graces, as has been abundantly manifested of late, in the presence of thousands; <span class="ital">to them that obey him </span>— That obey his gospel, and submit themselves to his government. “The testimony arising from this miraculous communication of the Spirit to Christians at that time, entirely removes the objection from Christ’s not appearing in public after his resurrection: for had there been any imposture, it had been easier of the two to have persuaded people at a distance, that he had so appeared to the Jewish rulers, or even to the multitude, and yet had been rejected, than that he had given his servants such extraordinary powers; since, had this assertion been false, every one might have been a witness to the falsehood of such a pretence, without the trouble and expense of a journey to Jerusalem, or any other distant place.” — Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:26-33 Many will do an evil thing with daring, yet cannot bear to hear of it afterward, or to have it charged upon them. We cannot expect to be redeemed and healed by Christ, unless we give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Faith takes the Saviour in all his offices, who came, not to save us in our sins, but to save us from our sins. Had Christ been exalted to give dominion to Israel, the chief priests would have welcomed him. But repentance and remission of sins are blessings they neither valued nor saw their need of; therefore they, by no means, admitted his doctrine. Wherever repentance is wrought, remission is granted without fail. None are freed from the guilt and punishment of sin, but those who are freed from the power and dominion of sin; who are turned from it, and turned against it. Christ gives repentance, by his Spirit working with the word, to awaken the conscience, to work sorrow for sin, and an effectual change in the heart and life. The giving of the Holy Ghost, is plain evidence that it is the will of God that Christ should be obeyed. And He will surely destroy those who will not have Him to reign over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We ought to obey ... - See the notes on <a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29, 30.

God had commanded by an angel, that the apostles should go to the temple, and there preach the doctrines of the Gospel; the sanhedrim had forbid them to speak and teach in the name of Christ; who were now to be obeyed? God, and not men: from whence it appears that the apostles were to be justified in disregarding the council, and neglecting its orders; and which is no ways contrary to that obedience and submission, that is to be yielded to those that are in authority, in things civil and lawful. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> Then Peter and the <i>other</i> apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</span><p>(10) We should obey man only in so far that in obeying him we also obey God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/5-29.htm" title="Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.">Acts 5:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ οἱ ἀπόστολοι</span>] <span class="ital">and</span> (generally) <span class="ital">the apostles</span>.

It is quite like the style of the New Testament to say “Peter and the apostles,” and it is not implied hereby that Peter was excluded from the number of the Apostles, but, as he probably was the chief speaker, his name is singled out for prominence in the narrative (see note on <a href="/acts/4-6.htm" title="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.">Acts 4:6</a>).

Sometimes &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9; is used. But this word, in itself, is the only one of the several in use which expresses the conception of obedience exclusively. &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is to obey as the result of listening to another: &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is to obey as the result of persuasion. This is the special term for the obedience which one owes to authority (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;): It occurs four times in the New Testament: <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, <a href="/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>; <a href="/acts/27-21.htm">Acts 27:21</a>; <a href="/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>; and in every case, of obedience to established authority, either of God or of magistrates. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm">Acts 27:21</a>, where it is used of the ship's officers hearkening to Paul's admonition not to loose from Crete, Paul speaks of his admonition as divinely inspired; compare <a href="/acts/27-10.htm">Acts 27:10</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>, Peter and John say hearken (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;). That is a mere listening to or considering the proposition made to them. This is a deliberate course of action. </body></html>
