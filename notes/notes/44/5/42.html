(1) Annas lived to see five of his sons fill the office of high priest (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 9, § 1); but his old age was overclouded by the tumults raised by the Zealots under John of Gischala, in the reign of Vespasian, and before he died the sanctuary was occupied by them, and became in very deed a “den of robbers” (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>iv. 3, § 7). (2) Joseph, surnamed Caiaphas, his son-in-law, who owed his appointment to Gratus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 2, § 2), was deposed by the Proconsul Vitellius, A.D. 36 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xviii.</span> 4, § 3), and disappears from history. (3) On John and Alexander, see Notes on <a href="/acts/4-6.htm" title="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.">Acts 4:6</a>. (4) Gamaliel, who is not mentioned by Josephus, continued to preside over the Sanhedrin under Caligula and Claudius, and is said to have died eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem, and to have sanctioned the Anathema, or “Prayer against heretics,” drawn up by Samuel the Little (Lightfoot, <span class= "ital">Cent. Chorograph, </span>c. 15). Christian traditions, however, represent him as having been secretly a disciple of Christ (Pseudo-Clement, <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> i. 65), and to have been baptised by Peter and Paul, with Nicodemus, who is represented as his nephew, and his son Abibas (<span class= "ital">Photius Cod.</span> 171, p. 199). In a legendary story, purporting to come from a priest of Syria, named Lucian, accepted by Augustine, he appears as having buried Stephen and other Christians, and to have been buried himself in the same sepulchre with the Protomartyr and Nicodemus at Caphar-algama (August. <span class= "ital">de Civ. Dei</span> xvii. 8, Serm. 318). Later Rabbis looked on him as the last of the great Teachers or Rabbans, and noted that till his time men had taught the Law standing, while afterwards they sat. The glory of the Law, they said, had departed with Gamaliel.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/5-42.htm" title="And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.">Acts 5:42</a></span>. <span class="ital">And daily in the temple, </span>&c. — The apostles were punished for preaching, and commanded strictly not to preach: yet they went on with their work with unabated zeal, and indefatigable diligence, omitting no opportunity of doing it. Observe, 1st, They preached <span class="ital">daily, </span>not only on sabbath days, or on Lord’s days, but <span class="ital">every day, </span>as duly as the day came; not fearing lest they should either injure their health, or cloy their hearers. 2d, They preached both <span class="ital">publicly </span>in the temple, and <span class="ital">privately in every house: </span>in promiscuous assemblies, to which all resorted: and in the select assemblies of Christians, appointed for special ordinances. They did not think that either of these would excuse them from the other, knowing they were to <span class="ital">preach the word in season and out of season. </span>Though in the temple they were more exposed, and were under the eye of their enemies, yet they did not confine themselves to their little oratories in their own houses, but ventured into the post of danger: and though they had the liberty of the temple, a consecrated place, yet they made no difficulty of preaching in houses: <span class="ital">in every house </span>— Even the poorest. 3d, We are also told what was the subject of their preaching; they preached <span class="ital">Jesus Christ; </span>they not only preached concerning him, but they preached him, exhibiting him to those that heard them, as their Prophet, Priest, and King; their Teacher, Mediator, Governor, and Judge; their Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption: they preached, <span class="ital">not themselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, </span>as the one Saviour of lost sinners, making it their chief business to advance his honour and interest, and not their own. This was the preaching that gave most offence to the priests and rulers: they were willing they should preach any thing but Christ; but the apostles would not alter their subject to please them. Observe, reader, it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ; Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; Christ dying for us; Christ living in us; nothing besides this, or what is reducible to it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:34-42 The Lord still has all hearts in his hands, and sometimes directs the prudence of the worldly wise, so as to restrain the persecutors. Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And daily ... - Compare <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>.

Every day, with great constancy and assiduity, both publicly and privately; in the temple, the place of public worship, where the Jews resorted on that account; and in each of their private houses, as often as they had opportunity: <p>they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, truly and properly God, the only Saviour of sinners: they preached up the dignity of his person, the grace of his incarnation, the obedience of his life, the benefits of his sufferings and death; they preached his resurrection from the dead, and the resurrection of the dead through him; they declared his ascension to heaven, his session at the right hand of God, and intercession for his people; they preached peace and pardon by his blood, atonement of sin by his sacrifice, justification by his righteousness, and complete redemption and salvation by him. And this they did without ceasing, not regarding the orders and threats of the sanhedrim; they waxed bolder and bolder in the ministry of the word, and were more constant and assiduous in it; their reproaches and persecutions increased their zeal for Christ, and his cause. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And daily in the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</span><p>(p) Both publicly and privately.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">42</span>. <span class="ital">And daily in the temple, and in every house</span>] Read, as in <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>, <span class="ital">in the temple and at home</span>.

The spirit and conduct of the apostles here recorded is a precious example to their successors. To glory in the cross, to count shame endured for Christ's sake the highest honor, and to be unwearied and undaunted in teaching and preaching Jesus Christ through good report and through evil report, is the true character and work of every bishop of souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
