The construction without that preposition would be <span class="ital">and there came also together the multitude out of the cities round about Jerusalem</span>. The use of the word <span class="ital">city</span> (<span class="greekheb">πόλις</span>) is common even when the places so called are very insignificant, as of Nazareth (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm" title="And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.">Matthew 2:23</a>), Nain (<a href="/luke/7-11.htm" title="And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.">Luke 7:11</a>), and Arimathæa (<a href="/luke/23-51.htm" title="(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.">Luke 23:51</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits</span>] It was recognized that the power of the Apostles extended not only to physical, but also to spiritual maladies. Indeed the whole history being of a supernatural character, the cures wrought on ordinary maladies were of the nature of signs and wonders, and spake of a power which was not human. The power here displayed is that which in Christ’s own life was confessed to be that of the Son of God (<a href="/context/luke/4-40.htm" title="Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them....">Luke 4:40-41</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb in the original for <span class="ital">vexed</span> is found only here and in <a href="/luke/6-18.htm" title="And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.">Luke 6:18</a> in the N. T., and like the word rendered “gave up the ghost” (<span class="ital"><a href="/acts/5-5.htm" title="And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.">Acts 5:5</a>; <a href="/acts/5-10.htm" title="Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.">Acts 5:10</a></span>), is used frequently in the works of Greek medical writers, so that it is such a word as we should expect to find a physician using in the description of this malady.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unclean spirits</span>] are those which are called <span class="ital">wicked</span> in other parts of the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/12-45.htm" title="Then goes he, and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation.">Matthew 12:45</a>, &c.), and the former epithet is probably applied to them because the sufferer in his state of frenzy wandered into places where he would incur ceremonial defilement, as the demoniac who had his dwelling among the tombs (<a href="/mark/5-3.htm" title="Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:">Mark 5:3</a>), the latter on account of the evil effects so often patent in the condition of the afflicted person, as loss of speech, hearing and other senses, the belief of the Jews being that spirits afflicted with such maladies were the cause of the like affliction in human beings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and they were healed every one</span>] For it was only a complete faith which had prompted the bringing them unto the Apostles, and to such faith <span class="ital">all things</span> had been promised by Christ (<a href="/mark/9-23.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him that believes.">Mark 9:23</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- And there also came together the multitude from</span> for <span class="accented">there came also a multitude out of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">about Jerusalem</span> for <span class="accented">about unto Jerusalem</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">folk</span> for <span class="accented">folks</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that were</span> for <span class="accented">which were</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And there also came together</span>, etc. One great result of these numerous miracles would be to manifest that the Lord Jesus was still with his Church as truly as when he was upon the earth (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), and this manifestation remains for the comfort of his people, even now that such miracles have ceased. With regard to what is said in ver. 15 of the shadow of Peter being thought to have had a healing power, it may have been true that it had, as Christ could heal by a shadow as well as by a word or touch, but we cannot say for certain that it was so; anyhow, it was a marvelous season of refreshing to the Church, preparing her for the coming trial. </body></html>
