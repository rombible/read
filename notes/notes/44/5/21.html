Recoveries from sickness, releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of our life. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in the great congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are as precious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for all are concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live and die by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, in comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the name. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth. The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may be saved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of the gospel!

Dr. Lightfoot thinks, that the two other sanhedrim, or courts of judicature in Jerusalem, which consisted of twenty three persons apiece, are designed; and who, as he rightly observes from Maimonides (p), sat the one in the gate of the court, the other in the gate of the mountain of the house; so that all the courts in Jerusalem were called together at this time; and if they all met, they made up a hundred and seventeen men: <p>and sent to the prison to have them brought; that is, "the apostles", as the Syriac version reads. The sense is, that the high priest, and those that were with him at the same time that they convened all the courts of judicature in Jerusalem together, sent their officers to the prison, to fetch the apostles; or else the sanhedrim, and senate of Israel being met, they ordered their officers to go to the common jail, and bring the apostles before them, to be examined, tried, and judged by them. <p>(o) Maimon.

If the two words denote the same body <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> must be regarded as merely explicative (so Wendt as against Meyer) to emphasise the solemn importance and representative nature of the assembly (so Grimm-Thayer to signify the full Sanhedrim <span class="ital">sub v.</span> <span class="greekheb">γερ</span>. and so apparently Blass). If we adopt Rendall’s view <span class="greekheb">καί</span> may still be explicative, but in another way, specifying the comprehensive character of this meeting as compared with the hasty and informal gathering in <a href="/context/acts/4-5.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,...">Acts 4:5-6</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Kuinoel’s view, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). The difficulty has caused others to suggest that <span class="greekheb">γερ</span>. refers to men of age and experience who were asked to join the Council as assessors, or to some other assembly larger than the Sanhedrim and only summoned on special occasions. For the former view, Lumby and Plumptre (see also Page’s note) refer to Mishna, <span class="ital">Joma</span>, i., 1, where mention is made of “the chamber of the assessors,” <span class="ital">parhedrin</span> = <span class="greekheb">πάρεδροι</span>. Further we may note, Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. i., p. 172, E.T., in a note on this passage points out that as there can be no doubt as to the identity of the two conceptions <span class="greekheb">συνέδριον</span> and <span class="greekheb">γερουσία</span> (so too Zöckler and Weiss, <span class="ital">in loco</span>), <span class="greekheb">καί</span> must be taken as explanatory, or St. Luke makes a mistake in assuming that the <span class="greekheb">συνέδριον</span> was of a less comprehensive character than the <span class="greekheb">γερουσία</span>, “the Sanhedrin and all the elders of the people together”. Schürer prefers the latter alternative, but the former may reasonably be maintained not only from the Greek text but also because St. Luke’s information admittedly derived from a Jewish-Christian source is not likely to have been inaccurate. Hilgenfeld agrees with Weiss that in the source the O.T. expression <span class="greekheb">γερουσία</span>, <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm" title="Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-29.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:">Exodus 4:29</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a>, stood alone, but that the reviser prefixed the usual expression <span class="greekheb">συνέδριον</span> which in <a href="/acts/5-27.htm" title="And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,">Acts 5:27</a>; <a href="/acts/5-34.htm" title="Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;">Acts 5:34</a> is found without any addition.

They lost no time in obeying the command. How early it was possible for them to come to the Temple we find from the directions in the Talmud concerning the morning sacrifice. It is said (Mishna <span class="ital">Joma</span> iii. 1), “The Memunneh (see note on <a href="/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1</a>) said to them: Go ye out (on to the Temple wall or roof) and see whether the time for killing the sacrifice has arrived. If it had arrived, the out-looker said, ‘It has flashed forth’ (i.e. day has dawned). Matthia ben Shemuel said [that the form of question was] ‘Has the whole face of the east become lit up as far as to Hebron? And the man answered, Yes.’ So that the first sacrifice took place at the very peep of day.” A like explanation is found Mishna <span class="ital">Tamid</span> iii. 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But the high priest came</span>] i.e. into the council chamber, to consult on what should be done with the prisoners, of whose release they had as yet heard nothing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">called the council together</span>] This was evidently deemed a case of the utmost consequence, and all pains are bestowed to gather to the hearing the combined wisdom of the whole authorities, for now, as is seen from Gamaliel’s presence, not Sadducees alone were called. The word here rendered <span class="ital">council</span> means probably the smaller Sanhedrin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and all the senate of the children of Israel</span>] Senate is here used in its original sense = the older men, and is a literal rendering of the Greek <span class="ital">gerousia</span>, meaning the great Sanhedrin of 71 elders. The name indicates that these were assessors added to the council by reason of their age and weight of character. We find from the Jewish literature that such assessors were often appointed. In the extract Mishna <span class="ital">Joma</span> i. 1, quoted on <a href="/acts/4-6.htm" title="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.">Acts 4:6</a>, the word for “assessors” is <span class="ital">parhedrin</span>, i.e. the Greek <span class="greekheb">πάρεδροι</span>, and the adoption of such a word into the Jewish vocabulary shews that the office was not Jewish in origin but had become so firmly grafted among them as to justify the adoption of a foreign expression to describe it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/5-21.htm" title="And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.

About daybreak. In the hot climate of Jerusalem people are about very early in the meriting (comp. <a href="/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57, 75</a>). But the high priest, etc. The narrative would run more clearly if the passage were translated more literally, <span class="accented">Now when the high priest and they that were with him were come</span> (to the council-chamber the next day) <span class="accented">they called together</span>, etc. The narrative is taken up from vers. 17, 18. Having (ver. 18) put the apostles in prison, they met the next morning to decide how to punish them. The council (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the Hebraeo-Greek, <span class="accented">the Sanhedrim</span>, the great council of the nation, consisting of seventy-two members, usually presided over by the high priest. It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59</a>; <a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55</a>, etc.; and <a href="/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a>; <a href="/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>, etc.; above <a href="/acts/4-15.htm">Acts 4:15</a>). On the present occasion, besides the members of the Sanhedrim, there were gathered together <span class="cmt_word">all the senate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the children of Israel</span>, an expression which occurs only here, but which seems to comprise all the <span class="accented">elders</span> of the Jews, even though they were not members of the Sanhedrim. But some (Schleusner, Heinrich, etc.) understand it as merely another phrase for the Sanhedrim, added for explanation and amplification. The council, of course, were ignorant of the escape of the prisoners. The prison-house (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); "prison" (A.V.) represents <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> in the next verse. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Early in the morning (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;, beneath, is often used in the sense of just about, or near. &#x39f;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, is from &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;, to cause to arise: the dawn.

Taking on very early an official sense, the notion of age being merged in that of dignity. Thus in Homer &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; are the chiefs who form the king's council. Compare the Latin patres, fathers, the title used in addressing the Roman senate. The word in this passage is the name of the Spartan assembly, Gerousia, the assembly of elders, consisting of thirty members, with the two kings. "The well-known term," as Meyer remarks, "is fittingly transferred from the college of the Greek gerontes to that of the Jewish presbyters." They summoned, not only those elders of the people who were likewise members of the Sanhedrim, but the whole council (all the senate) of the representatives of the people.<p>Prison (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Still another word for prison. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-18.htm">Acts 5:18</a>, <a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a>. Rev., prison-house. The different words emphasize different aspects of confinement. &#x3a4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is keeping, as the result of guarding. See on <a href="/acts/5-18.htm">Acts 5:18</a>. &#x3a6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769; emphasizes the being put under guard, and &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; the being put in bonds. </body></html>
