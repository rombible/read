And this is accordingly to be noted as the first actual experience of persecution falling on the whole company of the Twelve, and not on Peter and John only. They were probably convicted of the minor offence of causing a disturbance in the Temple, though dismissed, as with a verdict of “not” proven, “on the graver charge of heresy.

Common sense tells us to be cautious, while experience and observation show that the success of frauds in matters of religion has been very short. Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us conformable to his pattern, and serviceable to his interest. They rejoiced in it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enabled us so to do. The apostles did not preach themselves, but Christ. This was the preaching that most offended the priests. But it ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ: Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified; nothing beside this, but what has reference to it. And whatever is our station or rank in life, we should seek to make Him known, and to glorify his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to him they agreed - Greek: They were "persuaded" by him; or they trusted to him. They agreed only so far as their design of putting them to death was concerned. They abandoned that design. But they did "not" comply with his advice to let them entirely alone.<p>And beaten them - The usual amount of "lashes" which were inflicted on offenders was 39, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>. "Beating," or "whipping," was a common mode of punishing minor offences among the Jews. It was expressly foretold by the Saviour that the apostles would be subjected to this, <a href="/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17</a>. The reason why they did not adopt the advice of Gamaliel altogether doubtless was, that if they did, they feared that their "authority" would be despised by the people. They had commanded them not to preach; they had threatened them <a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18</a>; <a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>; they had imprisoned them <a href="/acts/5-18.htm">Acts 5:18</a>; and now, if they suffered them to go without even the "appearance" of punishment, their authority, they feared, would be despised by the nation, and it would be supposed that the apostles had triumphed over the Sanhedrin. It is probable, also, that they were so indignant, that they could not suffer them to go without the gratification of subjecting them to the public odium of a "whipping." People, if they cannot accomplish their full purposes of malignity against the gospel, will take up with even some petty annoyance and malignity rather than let it alone. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-42. beaten them&#8212;for disobeying their orders (compare Lu 23:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To him they agreed; </span> they yielded to his reason and argument, being persuaded and convinced by it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beaten them; </span> this was what our Saviour had foretold them, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/10-17.htm" title="But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;">Matthew 10:17</a></span>; and thus the husbandmen took the householder’s servants and beat them, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/21-35.htm" title="And the farmers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.">Matthew 21:35</a></span>. They had power yet left them by the Romans to punish offenders in their synagogues, but not capitally nor publicly.

Perhaps both in this, as well as in bearing the apostles, they did not closely attend to Gamaliel's counsel, who advised them to keep their hands off of them, and not hinder them, but let them alone in what they were about: but this might be thought by them not to their reputation, nor sufficiently asserting their authority, to dismiss them, without saying or doing anything to them: <p>and let them go; from the council to their own company: they released them, and loosed them from their bonds; they set them at liberty, and let them go where they would; and so far they followed Gamaliel's advice. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/5-40.htm" title="And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.">Acts 5:40</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπείσθησαν δὲ αὐτῷ</span>: whatever scruples Gamaliel may have had in pressing matters against the Apostles, or even if the teaching of Christ, as some have conjectured, with much of which he might have sympathised as a follower of Hillel, had influenced his mind, or if, like Joseph of Arimathea, he too had not consented to the counsel and will of his fellow-Sanhedrists, there is no reason to suppose (see above) that he ever advanced beyond the compromise here suggested. It may be that Neander was right in his judgment that Gamaliel was too wise a man to render a fanatical movement more violent still by opposing it. Others however see in his words a mere <span class="ital">laisser-aller</span> view of matters, or a timid caution which betokened a mere waiter upon Providence. But at the same time there are occasions when Gamaliel’s advice may not be out of place, see Bengel on <a href="/acts/5-38.htm" title="And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:">Acts 5:38</a>, and Farrar, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, i., 110 ff.—<span class="greekheb">δείραντες</span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm" title="Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.">2 Corinthians 11:24</a> : the punishment was for minor offences, and it was now inflicted upon the Apostles because they had trangressed the command enjoined upon them previously, <a href="/acts/4-18.htm" title="And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.">Acts 4:18</a>. The Pharisees, probably by their superior number in the Sanhedrim (Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xiii., 10, 6), were able to secure the following of Gamaliel’s advice, and to prevent extreme measures against the Apostles, but they were not prepared to disregard the previous injunction of the Council which bade the Apostles refrain from uttering a word in the name of Jesus. But the Apostles themselves must have seen in the punishment a striking fulfilment of their Lord’s words, as in the closing hours of His earthly life He foretold their future sufferings for His Name. The penalty which must have been a very painful one, although the command not to exceed forty stripes often led to its mitigation, was often inflicted by the synagogues, and not only by the great Sanhedrim, for all kinds of offences as against heretics and others.
