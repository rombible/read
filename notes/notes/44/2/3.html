On that day—so it was computed by the later Rabbis, though the Book of Exodus (<a href="/exodus/19-1.htm" title="In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.">Exodus 19:1</a>) seems to leave the matter in some uncertainty—the Israelites had encamped round Sinai, and there had been thunders and darkness and voices, and the great Laws had been proclaimed. It was, that is, an epoch-making day in the religious history of Israel. It was fit that it should be chosen for another great epoch-making day, which, seeming at first to be meant for Israel only, was intended ultimately for mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Was fully come.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">was being accomplished.</span> The word seems chosen to express the fact that the meeting of the disciples was either on the vigil of the Feast-day, or in the early dawn. Assuming the Passover to have occurred on the night of the Last Supper, the Day of Pentecost would fall on the first day of the week, beginning, of course, at the sunset of the Sabbath. So the Churches of East and West have commemorated the day as on the eighth Sunday after Easter. In the Latin nations the name of Pentecost remains scarcely altered. The <span class= "ital">Pfingst</span> of the Germans shows it still surviving in a very contracted form. Some eminent scholars have thought that our <span class= "ital">Whitsun-day</span> represents it after a still more altered form, and that this is a more probable etymology of the word than those which connect it with the <span class= "ital">white</span> garments worn on that day by newly-baptised converts, or with the gift of “<span class= "ital">wit, or</span> wisdom.”<p><span class= "bld">With one accord in one place.</span>—Probably in the same large upper room as in <a href="/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>. We may reasonably think of the same persons as being present. The hour, we may infer from <a href="/acts/2-15.htm" title="For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.">Acts 2:15</a>, was early in the morning, and probably followed on a night of prayer. It is said, indeed, that devout Jews used to solemnise the vigil of Pentecost by a special thanksgiving to God for giving His Law to Israel; and this may well have been the occasion that brought the disciples together (Schöttgen, <span class= "ital">Hor. Hebr. in <a href="/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a></span>). It was, in the mystic language of the Rabbis, the night on which the Law, as the Bride, was espoused to Israel, as the Bridegroom. The frequent occurrence of the Greek word for “with one accord” (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>; <a href="/acts/5-12.htm" title="And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders worked among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.">Acts 5:12</a>) is significant as showing the impression made on the writer by the exceptional unity of the new society. Outside the Acts it is found only in <a href="/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">There appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and tongues as of fire were seen by them, parted among them.</span> The word translated “cloven” cannot possibly have that meaning. It is not uncommon (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/acts/2-45.htm" title="And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.">Acts 2:45</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-35.htm" title="And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and on my clothing did they cast lots.">Matthew 27:35</a>; <a href="/luke/22-17.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:">Luke 22:17</a>; and <a href="/john/19-24.htm" title="They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, They parted my raiment among them, and for my clothing they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.">John 19:24</a>), and is always used in the sense of dividing or distributing. What the disciples saw would, perhaps, be best described in modern phrase as a shower of fiery tongues, coming they knew not whence, lighting for a moment on each head, and then vanishing. The verb “it (sc., a tongue of fire) sat upon” is in the tense which expresses momentary, not continuous, action.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 We cannot forget how often, while their Master was with them there were strifes among the disciples which should be the greatest; but now all these strifes were at an end. They had prayed more together of late. Would we have the Spirit poured out upon us from on high, let us be all of one accord. And notwithstanding differences of sentiments and interests, as there were among those disciples, let us agree to love one another; for where brethren dwell together in unity, there the Lord commands his blessing. A rushing mighty wind came with great force. This was to signify the powerful influences and working of the Spirit of God upon the minds of men, and thereby upon the world. Thus the convictions of the Spirit make way for his comforts; and the rough blasts of that blessed wind, prepare the soul for its soft and gentle gales. There was an appearance of something like flaming fire, lighting on every one of them, according to John Baptist's saying concerning Christ; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. The Spirit, like fire, melts the heart, burns up the dross, and kindles pious and devout affections in the soul; in which, as in the fire on the altar, the spiritual sacrifices are offered up. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than before. They were filled with the graces of the Spirit, and more than ever under his sanctifying influences; more weaned from this world, and better acquainted with the other. They were more filled with the comforts of the Spirit, rejoiced more than ever in the love of Christ and the hope of heaven: in it all their griefs and fears were swallowed up. They were filled with the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they had miraculous powers for the furtherance of the gospel. They spake, not from previous though or meditation, but as the Spirit gave them utterance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there appeared unto them - There were seen by them, or they saw. The fire was first seen by them in the room before it rested in the form of tongues on the heads of the disciples. Perhaps the fire appeared at first as scintillations or coruscations, until it became fixed on their heads.<p>Tongues - &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  glo&#772;ssai. The word "tongue" occurs often in the Scriptures to denote the member which is the instrument of taste and speech, and also to denote "language" or "speech" itself. It is also used, as with us, to denote what in shape resembles the tongue. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>, <a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a> (in Hebrew), "a tongue of gold," that is, a wedge of gold; <a href="/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-19.htm">Joshua 18:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>, "The tongue of the sea," that is, a bay or gulf. Thus also we say "a tongue of land." The phrase "tongue of fire" occurs once, and once only, in the Old Testament <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, "Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble (Hebrew: tongue of fire), and the flame consumeth," etc. In this place the name tongue is given from the resemblance of a pointed flame to the human tongue. Anything long, narrow, and tending to a point is thus in the Hebrew called "a tongue." The word here means, therefore, "slender and pointed appearances" of flame, perhaps at first moving irregularly around the room.<p>cloven - Divided, separated - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  diamerizomenai - from the verb &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  diamerizo&#772;, "to divide, or distribute into parts." <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>, "they parted his garments"; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-17.htm">Luke 22:17</a>, "Take this (the cup) and divide it among yourselves." Probably the common opinion is, that these tongues or flames were, each one of them split, or forked, or cloven. But this is not the meaning of the expression. The idea is that they were separated or divided one from another; it was not one great flame, but was broken up, or cloven into many parts, and probably these parts were moving without order in the room. In the Syriac it is, "And there appeared unto them tongues which divided themselves like fire, and sat upon each of them." The old Ethiopic version reads it, "And fire, as it were, appeared to them and sat on them."<p>And it sat upon each of them - Or "rested," in the form of a lambent or gentle flame, upon the head of each one. This showed that the prodigy was directed to them, and was a very significant emblem of the promised descent of the Holy Spirit. After the rushing sound and the appearance of the flames, they could not doubt that here was some remarkable interposition of God. The appearance of fire, or flame, has always been regarded as a most striking emblem of the Divinity. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-3</a>, God is said to have manifested himself to Moses in a bush which was burning, yet not consumed. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-20</a>, God descended on Mount Sinai in the midst of thunders, and lightnings, and smoke, and fire, striking emblems of his presence and power. See also <a href="/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>. Thus, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, God is said to be "a consuming fire." Compare <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. See <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12-14</a>. The Classic reader will also instantly recall the beautiful description in Virgil (Aeneid, b. 2:680-691). Other instances of a similar prodigy are also recorded in profane writers (Pliny, H. N., 2:37; Livy, 1:39). These appearances to the apostles were emblematic, doubtless:<p>(1) Of the promised Holy Spirit, as a Spirit of purity and of power. The prediction of John the Immerser, "He shall baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire" <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a> would probably be recalled at once to their memory.<p>(2) The unique appearance, that of tongues, was an emblem of the diversity of languages which they were about to be able to utter. Any form of fire would have denoted the presence and power of God; but a form was adopted expressive of "what was to occur." Thus, "any divine appearance" or "manifestation" at the baptism of Jesus might have denoted the presence and approbation of God; but the form chosen was that of a dove descending - expressive of the mild and gentle virtues with which he was to be imbued. So in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, any form of flame might have denoted the presence of God; but the appearance actually chosen was one that was strikingly emblematical of his providence. In the same way, the appearance here symbolized their special endowments for entering on their great work - the ability to speak with new tongues. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. cloven tongues, like as of fire, &c.&#8212;"disparted tongues," that is, tongue-shaped, flame-like appearances, rising from a common center or root, and resting upon each of that large company:&#8212;beautiful visible symbol of the burning energy of the Spirit now descending in all His plenitude upon the Church, and about to pour itself through every tongue, and over every tribe of men under heaven!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Cloven tongs; </span> to signify the variety of languages which the apostles should be enabled to speak, to qualify them to preach the gospel unto all nations, and to remove the obstacle which the confusion of tongues caused. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like as of fire; </span> which represented, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

An emblem of the various tongues and languages, in which they were to preach the Gospel; these appearances were like flames of fire parted, and these parted flames looked like tongues; so, a flame of fire is with, the Jews called, , "a tongue of fire", <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a> hence the Apostle James compares a tongue to fire, <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a> this was the baptism with fire, John the Baptist speaks of; see Gill on <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>; and the Jews say (t), <p>"the holy blessed God baptizeth with fire, and the wise shall understand. <p>Through this baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire, the apostles became more knowing, and had a greater understanding of the mysteries of the Gospel, and were more qualified to preach it to people of all nations and languages. The Holy Spirit, in his gifts and graces, is compared to fire, because of its purity, light, and heat, as well as consuming nature; the Spirit sanctifies, and makes men pure and holy, purges from the dross of sin, error and superstition; and enlightens the minds of men, and gives them knowledge of divine and spiritual things; and fills them with zeal and fervour for the glory of God and Christ, and the good of his church and interest, and for the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel; as well as fortifies them against their enemies, whom he consumes, according to <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> a passage of Scripture the Jews make use of in an uncommon sense; for they say (u), that as <p>"Jerusalem was destroyed by fire, "by fire it shall be built again"; as it is said, <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a> "For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about". <p>The pouring forth of the Spirit upon the apostles, in this form of cloven tongues, as of fire, was indeed the means of rebuilding Jerusalem, in a spiritual sense; or of founding the Gospel church state in the world: <p>and it sat upon each of them; the fire, or the Holy Ghost in the appearance of fire. The Syriac and Arabic versions read, "and they sat upon each of them"; and so Beza's most ancient copy; that is, the cloven tongues sat on them; either one upon one of them and another upon another, or many upon each of them: where they sat, whether on their lips, or on their heads, it not certain, probably on the latter; nor how long they sat; however, their sitting upon them may denote the continuance of the gifts and graces of the Spirit with them. These cloven tongues cannot but bring to mind the division and confusion of the tongues or languages at Babel; which gave rise to different nations, and different religions; but these divided tongues gave rise to the spreading of the Gospel, and settling the true religion among the nations of the world. The Jews (w) seem to have respect to this account, when they tell us of. <p>"lights from above, that came forth and dwelt in the synagogues,  "on the heads" of those that prayed, and the lights  "were divided" upon their heads. <p>(t) R.

They were thus appearances of tongues, which were luminous, but did not burn; not really consisting of fire, but only <span class="greekheb">ὡσεὶ πυρός</span>; and not confluent into one, but distributing themselves severally on the assembled.

The whole phenomenon is to be understood as a miraculous operation of God manifesting Himself in the Spirit, by which, as by the preceding sound from heaven, the effusion of the Spirit was made known as <span class="ital">divine</span>, and His efficacy on the minds of those who were to receive Him was enhanced.

Lange, Apost. Zeitalt. II. p. 19, fancifully supposes that the noise of the wind was a streaming of the heavenly powers from above, audible to the opened visionary sense, and that the tongues of fire were a disengaging of the solar fire-power of the earth and its atmosphere (?). The attempts, also, to convert this appearance of fire-like tongues into an accidental electric <span class="ital">natural occurrence</span> (Paulus, Thiess, and others) are in vain; for these flames, which make their appearance, during an accumulation of electric matter, on towers, masts, and even on men, present far too weak resemblances; and besides, the room of a house, where the phenomenon <span class="ital">exclusively</span> occurred, was altogether unsuited for any such natural development. The representation of the text is monstrously altered by Heinrichs: <span class="ital">Fulgura cellam vere pervadebant, sed in inusitatas imagines ea effinxit apostolorum commota mens;</span> as also by Heumann: that they believed that they saw the fiery tongues merely <span class="ital">in the ecstatic state</span>; and not less so by Eichhorn, who says that “<span class="ital">they saw flames</span>” signifies in rabbinical <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>: they were transported into <span class="ital">ecstatic excitement</span>. The passages adduced by Eichhorn from Schoettgen contain no merely figurative modes of expression, but fancies of the later Rabbins to be understood literally in imitation of the phenomena at Sinai,—of which phenomena, we may add, a real historical analogue is to be recognised in our passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκάθισέ τε</span>] namely, not an indefinite subject, <span class="ital">something</span> (Hildebrand, comp.

Oecumenius, Beza, Castalio, Schoettgen, Kuinoel, incorrectly take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠῦΡ</span></span></span> as the subject, since, in fact, there was no fire at all, but only something resembling fire; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὩΣΕῚ ΠΥΡΌς</span></span></span> serves only for comparison, and consequently <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠῦΡ</span></span></span> cannot be the subject of the continued narrative. Others, as Chrysostom, Theophylact, Luther, Calvin, Wolf, Bengel, Heinrichs <span class="ital">et al.</span>, consider the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span> as subject. In that case it would have to be interpreted, with Fritzsche (<span class="ital">Conject</span>. I. p. 13): <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΊΣΑΝΤΟς ἘΦʼ ἝΝΑ ἝΚΑΣΤΟΝ ΑὐΤῶΝ ἘΠΛΉΣΘΗΣΑΝ ἍΠΑΝΤΕς ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΟς ἉΓΊΟΥ</span></span></span>, and <a href="/matthew/17-18.htm" title="And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.">Matthew 17:18</a> would be similar. Very harsh, seeing that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ ἍΓΙΟΥ</span></span></span>, in so far as it <span class="ital">sat</span> on the assembled, would appear as identical with its symbol, the fiery tongues; but in so far as it <span class="ital">filled</span> the assembled, as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> itself, different from the symbol.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΈ</span></span></span> joining on to the preceding (Lachm. reads <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>, following insufficient testimony) connects <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΆΘΙΣΕ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὬΦΘΗΣΑΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> into an unity, so that the description divides itself into the <span class="ital">three</span> acts: <span class="greekheb">ὤφθησαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ἐπλήσθησαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and <span class="greekheb">ἤρξαντο κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., as is marked by the thrice recurring <span class="greekheb">καί</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[113] Therefore the expression is not to be explained from <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 5:24</a>, for there לְשׁוֹן אֵשׁ is a representation of that which consumes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/2-3.htm" title="And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them.">Acts 2:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">διαμεριζόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γλῶσσαι</span>: the audible <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> is followed by a visible: <span class="greekheb">γλῶσσαι</span> the organs of speech by which the wonderful works of God were to be proclaimed, so that the expression cannot be explained from <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 5:24</a>, where the tongue of fire is represented as an organ of destruction (Wendt, note, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). <span class="greekheb">ὡσεὶ πυρός</span> in their appearance and brightness. The words themselves therefore forbid reference to a natural phenomenon, to say nothing of the fact of the spiritual transformation of the Apostles which followed. Fire like wind was symbolic of the divine Presence, <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.">Exodus 3:2</a>, and of the Spirit who purifies and sanctifies, <a href="/ezekiel/1-13.htm" title="As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.">Ezekiel 1:13</a>, <a href="/context/malachi/3-2.htm" title="But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:...">Malachi 3:2-3</a> (see Wetstein for classical instances of fire symbolical of the presence of the deity; <span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, Homer, <span class="ital">Iliad</span>, xviii., 214; Virgil, <span class="ital">Æn.</span>, ii., 683). <span class="greekheb">διαμεριζ</span>., lit[116], dividing or parting themselves off. R.V. “tongues parting asunder,” so that originally they were one, as one mighty flame of fire. This rendering is strictly in accordance with the meaning of the verb.

The singular best expresses the result of the tongues parting asunder, and of the distribution to each and all.

The resting of a flame of fire upon the head as a token of the favour of Heaven may be illustrated from classical sources (see above and instances in Wetstein), but the thought here is not so much of fire as the token of divine favour, as of the tongue (as of fire) conferring a divine power to utter in speech divine things.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[116] literal, literally.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">cloven tongues like as of fire</span>] Better, <span class="ital">tongues like as of fire</span> <span class="bld">parting asunder</span>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 5:24</a>, where the Hebrew has “tongue of fire” while the A. V. gives only “fire.” It is also to be noticed that the appearance is not called fire, but only compared unto fire.

The intention of the writer is to describe something far more persistent than meteoric light or flashes of electricity.

Yet a considerable part of the literal (unfigurative) meaning remains, because speaking is the subject in hand. There were little tongue-like flames resting on the heads of the disciples individually, not coming forth out of their mouths; for there follows, and sat, viz. the Holy Spirit (see foll. ver.), which “came upon” them, ch. <a href="/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a>, under the appearance of the tongues.

The idea of the <span class="accented">cloven tongue, i.e.</span> a tongue parted into two, which is thought to have been the origin of the miter, is not suggested either by the Greek or by the circumstances, and is clearly a mistaken one. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means <span class="accented">distributing themselves</span> or <span class="accented">being distributed.</span> From the central apparition, or rather place of sound, they saw issuing forth many several tongues, looking like small flames of fire, and one such tongue sat upon each one of the brethren or disciples present. <span class="cmt_word">Each one</span>.

For not only must the <span class="accented">all</span> of ver. 1 refer to the same company as was described in the preceding chapter (vers. 15-26), but it is quite clear in ver. 15 of this chapter that Peter and the eleven (ver. 14), standing up separate from the body of the disciples, say of them, "These are not drunken, as ye suppose;" which is a demonstration that those of whom they thus spoke had been speaking with tongues (see also <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>). St. Augustine, too, says that the hundred and twenty all received the Holy Spirit. To the same effect Meyer, Wordsworth, Alford (who adds, "Not the hundred and twenty only, but all the believers in Christ then congregated at Jerusalem;" so also Lange). Farrar well remarks, "It was the consecration of a whole Church to be all of them a chosen generation, a royal priest- hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people" ('Life of St. Paul,' <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>.). Lange says, "Not only the apostles, but all the disciples, were filled with the Holy Ghost.
