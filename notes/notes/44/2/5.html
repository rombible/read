It seems, while the apostles and other disciples were discoursing on these marvellous events, they spoke to different classes of people there assembled in such a great variety of languages, and with so much readiness and propriety, as were perfectly astonishing and unexampled, even among the most learned of mankind. <span class="ital">And they were all amazed and in doubt </span>— That is, the pious, or well disposed were; <span class="ital">saying one to another, What meaneth this? </span>— What can possibly be intended by this unaccountable appearance; but <span class="ital">others mocking </span>— The unbelievers begin with <span class="ital">mocking, </span>thence proceed to <span class="ital">cavilling, </span><a href="/acts/4-7.htm" title="And when they had set them in the middle, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have you done this?">Acts 4:7</a>; to <span class="ital">threats, </span><a href="/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>; to <span class="ital">imprisoning, </span><a href="/acts/5-18.htm" title="And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.">Acts 5:18</a>; to <span class="ital">blows, </span><a href="/acts/2-40.htm" title="And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.">Acts 2:40</a>; to <span class="ital">slaughter, </span><a href="/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58</a>.

But it is not always confined to this signification; and it is not improbable that many wealthy foreign Jews had a permanent residence in Jerusalem for the convenience of being near the temple. This was the more probable, as about that time the Messiah was expected to appear, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2</a>.<p>Jews - Jews by birth; of Jewish descent and religion.<p>Devout men - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  andres eulabe&#772;is. Literally, men of cautious and circumspect lives, or who lived in a prudent manner. The term is then applied to men who were cautious about offending God; who were careful to observe his commandments. It is hence a general expression to denote pious or religious men, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm">Acts 8:2</a>, "And devout men carried Stephen to his burial"; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>," And the same man (Simeon) was just, and devout." The word "devout" means "yielding a solemn and reverential attention to God in religious exercises, particularly in prayer, pious, sincere, solemn" (Webster), and very well expresses the force of the original.<p>Out of every nation under heaven - A general expression meaning from all parts of the earth. The countries from which they came are more particularly specified in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9-11</a>. The Jews at that time were scattered into almost all nations, and in all places had synagogues. See the <a href="/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a> note; <a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a> note; <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a> note. Still they would naturally desire to be present as often as possible at the great feasts of the nation in Jerusalem. Many would seek a residence there for the convenience of being present at the religious solemnities. Many who came up to the Feast of the Passover would remain to the Feast of the Pentecost. The consequence of this would be, that on such occasions the city would be full of strangers. We are told that when Titus besieged Jerusalem, an event which occurred at about the time of the Feast of the Passover, there were no less than three million people in the city.<p>Josephus also mentions an instance in which great multitudes of Jews from other nations were present at the feast of Pentecost (Jewish Wars, book 2, chapter 3, section 1). What is here stated as occurring at that time is true of the inhabitants of Jerusalem - four or five thousand in number who reside there now. A large portion of them are from abroad. Prof. Hackett (Illustrations of Scripture, p. 228, 229) says of them, "Few of them, comparatively, are natives of the country. The majority of them are aged persons, who repair to the holy city to spend the remainder of their days and secure the privilege of being buried in the Valley of the Kedron, which, as their traditions assert, is to be the scene of the last judgment. At the Jews' Wailing Place one day I met a venerable man, bowed with age, apparently beyond 80, who told me that, in obedience to his sense of duty, he had forsaken his children and home in England, and had come, unattended by any friend, to die and make his grave at Jerusalem. Others of them are those who come here to fulfill a vow, or acquire the merit of a pilgrimage, and then return to the countries where they reside. Among them may be found representatives from almost every land, though the Spanish, Polish, and German Jews compose the greater number.<p>Like their brethren in other parts of Palestine, except a few in some commercial places, they are wretchedly poor, and live chiefly on alms contributed by their countrymen in Europe and America. They devote most of their time to holy employments, as they are called; they frequent the synagogues, roam over the country to visit places memorable in their ancient history, and read assiduously the Old Testament and the writings of their rabbis. Those of them who make any pretensions to learning understand the Hebrew and rabbinic, and speak as their vernacular tongue the language of the country where they formerly lived, or whence their fathers emigrated." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-11. there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every nation&#8212;not, it would seem, permanently settled there (see Ac 2:9), though the language seems to imply more than a temporary visit to keep this one feast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not only constant inhabitants, but such as had on occasion their lodgings there; partly out of a constant respect, which both Jews and proselytes had for that place, (for the temple and their worship sake; it being also a place for learning and education, as appears by the colleges and synagogues mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a></span>), but especially now the concourse from all parts must needs have been very great, it being one of those times in which all the males were to appear before God: to which might be added, the great expectation they had of the Messiah made them to omit no occasion of inquiring concerning him, the prophecies concerning the time of his coming being fulfilled, and they could not be ignorant of the many and great things concerning the true Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of every nation under heaven; </span> whither the Jews had been dispersed in the two or three greater or other lesser dispersions.

The expression, as Zöckler points out, is not quite synonymous with that in <a href="/acts/2-14.htm" title="But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my words:">Acts 2:14</a> (or with <a href="/luke/13-4.htm" title="Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?">Luke 13:4</a>), and he explains it as above. There is certainly no need to consider the word, with Spitta and Hilgenfeld, as an epithet added by a later editor, or to omit <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖοι</span>, as Blass strongly urges (while Hilgenfeld desires to retain this word). The word may fairly be regarded as contrasted with <span class="greekheb">Γαλιλαῖοι</span> (<a href="/acts/2-7.htm" title="And they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?">Acts 2:7</a>). The same view of it as applied here to foreign Jews who had their stated residence in Jerusalem is maintained by Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. ii., p. 291 (note) E.T.—<span class="greekheb">κατοικεῖν</span> is used generally of taking up a permanent abode as in contrast to <span class="greekheb">παροικεῖν</span> used of temporary sojourn, and on the frequent use of the word in St. Luke, Friedrich, <span class="ital">ubi supra</span>, p. 39.

If <span class="greekheb">κατοικοῦντες</span> includes the Jews who had come up to the Feast as well as those who had settled in Jerusalem from other countries, this expression is strikingly illustrated by the words of Philo, <span class="ital">De Monarchia</span>, ii. 1, p. 223.

It is said (T. B. <span class="ital">Kethuboth</span>, III a), “Everyone that is buried in the land of Israel is in as good case as if he were buried under the altar,” and there are many other like expressions in the immediate context of this quotation.
