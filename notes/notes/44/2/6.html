His own idiom, whether it was a foreign language, or whether it was a modification of the Hebrew. The word may mean either; but it is probable that the foreign Jews would greatly modify the Hebrew, or conform almost entirely to the language spoken in the country where they lived. We may remark here that this effect of the descent of the Holy Spirit was not special to that time. A work of grace on the hearts of people in a revival of religion will always "be noised abroad." A multitude will come together, and God often, as he did here, makes use of this motive to bring them under the influence of religion. Curiosity was the motive here, and it was the occasion of their being brought under the power of truth, and of their conversion. In thousands of cases this has occurred since. The effect of what they saw was to confound them, to astonish them, and to throw them into deep perplexity. They made no complaint at first of the irregularity of what was done, but were all amazed and overwhelmed. So the effect of a revival of religion is often to convince the multitude that it is indeed a work of the Holy One; to amaze them by the display of his power; and to silence opposition and cavil by the manifest presence and the power of God. A few afterward began to cavil <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm">Acts 2:13</a>, as some will always do in a revival; but the mass were convinced, as will be the case always, that this was a mighty display of the power of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-11. there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every nation&#8212;not, it would seem, permanently settled there (see Ac 2:9), though the language seems to imply more than a temporary visit to keep this one feast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Noised abroad; </span> either the miraculous winds were heard, or the report of what had happened was spread abroad. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Were confounded; </span> either out of shame that they had slain Christ, whom God thus extraordinarily glorified; or out of admiration at so extraordinary a matter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every man heard them speak in his own language; </span> probably, not that the same words spoken by the apostles were diversified according to every one’s understanding, for then the miracle had been wrought in their auditors, and not in the apostles; but that the apostles did speak to every one in their proper and most intelligible language: and this was the gift of tongues, which for some time after also was continued in the church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now when this was noised abroad,....

Luke represents the matter in such a way that this noise sounded forth from the house of meeting to the street, and that thereby the multitude were induced to come thither. In this case neither an earthquake (Neander) nor a “sympathy of the susceptible” (Lange) are to be called in to help, because there is no mention of either; in fact, the <span class="ital">wonderful</span> character of the noise is sufficient. Others, as Heinrichs, Kuinoel, Bleek, Schulz, Wieseler, Hilgenfeld, think that the <span class="ital">loud speaking</span> of the inspired is here meant. But in that case we should expect the plural, especially as this speaking occurred in different languages; and besides, we should be obliged to conceive this speaking as being strong, like a crying, which is not indicated in <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; therefore Wieseler would have it taken only as a definition of <span class="ital">time</span>, which the aorist does not suit, because the speaking continues.

It is, as well as in <a href="/acts/2-8.htm" title="And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?">Acts 2:8</a>, designedly chosen, because the foreigners who arrived spoke not entirely different <span class="ital">languages</span>, but in part only different <span class="ital">dialects</span> of the same language. Thus, for example, the Asiatics, Phrygians, and Pamphylians, respectively spoke Greek, but in different idioms; the Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, Persian, but also in different provincial forms. Therefore, the persons possessed by the Spirit, according to the representation of the text, expressed themselves in the peculiar local dialects of the <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρων γλωσσῶν</span>. The view that the <span class="ital">Aramaic</span> dialect was that in which all the speakers spoke (van Hengel), appears—from <a href="/acts/2-8.htm" title="And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?">Acts 2:8</a>; from the list of nations, which would be destitute of significance; from <span class="greekheb">προσήλυτοι</span> (<a href="/acts/2-10.htm" title="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,">Acts 2:10</a>), which would be meaningless; and from <a href="/acts/2-11.htm" title="Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.">Acts 2:11</a>,[123] as well as from the opinions expressed in <a href="/context/acts/2-12.htm" title="And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What means this?...">Acts 2:12-13</a>, which would be without a motive—as an exegetical impossibility, which is also already excluded by <span class="greekheb">εἷς ἕκαστος</span> in <a href="/acts/2-6.htm" title="Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.">Acts 2:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λαλούντων αὐτῶν</span>] not, of course, that all spoke in all dialects, but that one spoke in one dialect, and another in another.

This remark applies in opposition to Bleek, who objects to the common explanation of <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν ἑτέρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γλώσσαις</span>, that each individual must have spoken in the different languages simultaneously.

Wendt in revising Meyer’s rendering contends that the word is purposely introduced because <span class="greekheb">γλῶσσα</span>, <a href="/context/acts/2-3.htm" title="And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them....">Acts 2:3-4</a>, had just been employed not in the sense of language but tongue, and so might have been misunderstood if repeated here with <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν</span>. On the other hand it may be urged that some of the distinctions in the list are those of dialect, and that St. Luke intentionally used a word meaning both language and dialect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[119]omm. commentary, commentator.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Now when this was noised abroad</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">And when this sound was heard</span>. <span class="greekheb">Φενή</span> though not the same word as is used for <span class="ital">sound</span> in <a href="/acts/2-2.htm" title="And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.">Acts 2:2</a>, yet is never found in the sense of a <span class="ital">report</span> or <span class="ital">rumour</span>, as is given by the A.
