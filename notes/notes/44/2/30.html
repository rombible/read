Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - As David was dead and buried, it was clear that he could not have referred to himself in this remarkable declaration.

Many of the prophecies relating to the Messiah are found in the Psalms of David: <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, compare <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>  - <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>, compare <a href="/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>  - <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-48.htm">Matthew 27:48</a>  - <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>, compare <a href="/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>.<p>And knowing - Knowing by what God had said to him respecting his posterity.<p>Had sworn with an oath - The places which speak of God as having sworn to David are found in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>, "I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish," etc.; and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>, "The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, he will not turn from it, Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon my throne"; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35-36</a>. The promise to which reference is made in all these places is in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>.<p>Of the fruit of his loins - Of his descendants. See <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-19.htm">1 Kings 8:19</a>, etc.<p>According to the flesh - That is, so far as the human nature of the Messiah was concerned, he would be descended from David. Expressions like these are very remarkable. If the Messiah was only a man, they would be unmeaning. They are never used in relation to a mere man; and they imply that the speaker or writer supposed that there pertained to the Messiah a nature which was not according to the flesh. See <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3-4</a>.<p>He would raise up Christ - That is, the Messiah. To raise up seed, or descendants, is to give them to him. The promises made to David in all these places had immediate reference to Solomon and to his descendants. But it is clear that the New Testament writers understood them as referring also to the Messiah. And it is no less clear that the Jews understood that the Messiah was to be descended from David, <a href="/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-45.htm">Matthew 22:45</a>; <a href="/mark/11-10.htm">Mark 11:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>, etc. In what way these promises that were made to David were understood as applying to the Messiah, it may not be easy to determine. The fact, however, is clear. The following remarks may throw some light on the subject:<p>(a) The kingdom which was promised to David was to have no end; it was to be established forever. Yet his descendants died, and all other kingdoms changed.<p>(b) The promise likewise stood by itself; it was not made to any other of the Jewish kings; nor were similar declarations made of surrounding kingdoms and nations. It came, therefore, gradually to be applied to that future king and kingdom which was the hope of the nation; and their eyes were anxiously fixed on the long-expected Messiah.<p>(c) At the time that he came it had become the settled doctrine of the Jews that he was to descend from David, and that his kingdom was to be perpetual.<p>On this belief of the prophecy the apostles argued; and the opinions of the Jews furnished a strong point by which they could convince them that Jesus was the Messiah. Peter affirms that David was aware of this, and that he so understood the promise as referring not only to Solomon, but in a far more important sense to the Messiah. Happily we have a commentary of David himself as expressing his own views of that promise. That commentary is found particularly in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a>; In these Psalms there can be no doubt that David looked forward to the coming of the Messiah; and there can be as little that he regarded the promise made to him as extending to his coming and his reign.<p>It may be remarked that there are some important variations in the manuscripts in regard to this verse. The expression "according to the flesh" is omitted in many mss., and is now left out by Griesbach in his New Testament. It is omitted also by the ancient Syriac and Ethiopic versions, and by the Latin Vulgate.<p>To sit on his throne - To be his successor in his kingdom. Saul was the first of the kings of Israel. The kingdom was taken away from him and his posterity, and conferred on David and his descendants. It was determined that it should be continued in the family of David, and no more go out of his family, as it had from the family of Saul. The unique characteristic of David as king, or what distinguished him from the other kings of the earth, was that he reigned over the people of God. Israel was his chosen people, and the kingdom was over that nation. Hence, he that should reign over the people of God, though in a manner somewhat different from David, would be regarded as occupying his throne, and as being his successor. The form of the administration might be varied, but it would still retain its prime characteristic as being a reign over the people of God. In this sense the Messiah sits on the throne of David. He is his descendant and successor. He has an empire over all the friends of the Most High. And as that kingdom is destined to fill the earth, and to be eternal in the heavens, so it may be said that it is a kingdom which shall have no end. It is spiritual, but not the less real; defended not with carnal weapons, but not the less really defended; advanced not by the sword and the din of arms, but not the less really advanced against principalities, and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places; not under a visible head and earthly monarch, but not less really under the Captain of salvation and the King of kings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-36. David &#8230; is &#8230; dead and buried, &c.&#8212;Peter, full of the Holy Ghost, sees in this sixteenth Psalm, one Holy Man, whose life of high devotedness and lofty spirituality is crowned with the assurance, that though He taste of death, He shall rise again without seeing corruption, and be admitted to the bliss of God's immediate presence. Now as this was palpably untrue of David, it could be meant only of One other, even of Him whom David was taught to expect as the final Occupant of the throne of Israel. (Those, therefore, and they are many, who take David himself to be the subject of this Psalm, and the words quoted to refer to Christ only in a more eminent sense, nullify the whole argument of the apostle). The Psalm is then affirmed to have had its only proper fulfilment in Jesus, of whose resurrection and ascension they were witnesses, while the glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the ascended One, setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then witnessed by the thousands who stood listening to Him. A further illustration of Messiah's ascension and session at God's right hand is drawn from Ps 110:1, in which David cannot be thought to speak of himself, seeing he is still in his grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Had sworn with an oath; </span> not barely had sworn, which had been sufficient; but to show the excellency of the matter, and the necessity of our believing of it, as also the solemnity of the words, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/132-11.htm" title="The LORD has sworn in truth to David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of your body will I set on your throne.">Psalm 132:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the fruit of his loins; </span> such as should descend from him, as the virgin Mary did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the flesh; </span> as to his human nature, which our Saviour did truly partake of, being in the form of a servant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He would raise up Christ, </span> by the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of his virgin mother, as to his incarnation; and by the same power out of the grave, in his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To sit on his throne; </span> as <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32</a>,33</span>: not as a temporal king, for his kingdom is not of this world; but as David ruled over all the people of God, so does Christ, and shall do for ever. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore being a prophet,.... Who could foretell things to come, as he did many things concerning the sufferings and death of Christ, and the circumstances attending it, concerning his resurrection, ascension, and session at the right hand of God. So the title of his "Psalms", in the Syriac version, runs thus; the "Book of the Psalms of David, King and Prophet": and in the Arabic version, "the First Book of the Psalms of David the Prophet, King of the Children of Israel". Though the Jews (d) will not allow him, nor Solomon, nor Daniel, to be strictly and properly prophets, they make a difference between prophecy, and the Holy Spirit. They own, that the book of Psalms was written under the influence of the Holy Spirit, but not by prophecy; and therefore they place it among the Hagiographa, or holy writings, but not among the Prophets: though after all, Kimchi allows David to be a prophet, since he is called a man of God; for he says this name is not said of any but , "of a prophet" (e); and Peter is right in calling him so: <p>and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him; as he did in <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11</a>. <p>that of the fruit of his loins; of one that should be of his seed, that should spring from him, even the Virgin Mary, who was of the house and lineage of David: <p>according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ; would send him forth, according to the human nature; for this phrase respects not his resurrection from the dead, but his incarnation or exhibition in the flesh, as in <a href="/acts/3-26.htm">Acts 3:26</a>.

It is a common Hebraistic form of expression—<span class="greekheb">ὀσφύς</span> read here, but <span class="greekheb">κοιλία</span> in Ps. 131:11 (LXX); <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm" title="And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;">Genesis 35:11</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/6-9.htm" title="Notwithstanding you shall not build the house; but your son which shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.">2 Chronicles 6:9</a> (<a href="/hebrews/7-5.htm" title="And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:">Hebrews 7:5</a>).

The exact expression, <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς τῆς ὀσφύος</span>, is not found in the LXX, but <span class="greekheb">καρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς κοιλίας</span> is found, not only in the Psalm quoted but in <a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a> (<a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm" title="Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom you have done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?">Lamentations 2:20</a>), where the same Hebrew words are used as in the Psalm: <span class="greekheb">ὀσφύς</span> in the LXX is several times a translation of another Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">חֲלָצַיִם</span> (dual). This partitive construction (supply <span class="greekheb">τινα</span>) is also a Hebraistic mode of expression, and frequent in the LXX; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/2-18.htm" title="And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:">Acts 2:18</a>, <a href="/acts/5-2.htm" title="And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.">Acts 5:2</a>.

And... I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and will establish his kingdom....

But there is no mention there of an oath. But in <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, great stress is laid upon God having sworn to David: "I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations" (vers. 3, 4); and again, ver. 35, "Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David" <a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a> and <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, should be read through carefully (comp. also <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>).
