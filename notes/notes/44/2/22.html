Observe, reader, the amazing stress Peter lays upon Christ’s miracles: 1st, The matter of fact was not to be denied; they were done, says he, <span class="ital">in the midst of you </span>— In the midst of your country, your city, your solemn assemblies; <span class="ital">as ye yourselves also know </span>— You have been eye- witnesses of his miracles, and I appeal to yourselves whether you have any thing to object against them, or can offer any thing to disprove them. 2d, The inference from them cannot be disputed; the reasoning is as strong as the evidence; if he did those miracles, certainly God approved of him, showed him to be what he declared himself to be, the Son of God and the Saviour of the world: for the God of truth would never set his seal to a lie.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye men of Israel - Descendants of Israel or Jacob, that is, Jews. Peter proceeds now to the third part of his argument, to show that Jesus Christ had been raised up; that the scene which had occurred was in accordance with his promise, was proof of his resurrection, and of his exaltation to be the Messiah; and that, therefore, they should repent for their great sin in having put their own Messiah to death.<p>A man approved of God - A man who was shown or demonstrated to have the approbation of God, or to have been sent by him.<p>By miracles, and wonders, and signs - The first of these words properly means the displays of power which Jesus made; the second, the unusual or remarkable events which attended him, as suited to excite wonder or amazement; the third, the sights or proofs that he was from God. Together, they denote the array or series of remarkable works - raising the dead, healing the sick, etc., which showed that Jesus was sent from God. The proof which they furnished that he was from God was this, that He would not confer such power on an impostor, and that therefore Jesus was what he pretended to be.<p>Which God did, by him - The Lord Jesus himself often traced his power to do these things to his commission from the Father, but he did it in such a way as to show that he was closely united to him, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>, <a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>. Peter here says that God did these works by Jesus Christ, to show that Jesus was truly sent by him, and that therefore he had the seal and attestation of God. The same thing Jesus himself said, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>, "The work which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me." The great works which God has made in creation, as well as in redemption, he is represented as having done by his Son, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "By whom also he made the worlds," <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-19</a>.<p>In the midst of you - In your own land. It is also probable that many of the persons present had been witnesses of his miracles.<p>As ye yourselves also know - They knew it either by having witnessed them, or by the evidence which everywhere abounded of the truth that he had performed them. The Jews, even in the time of Christ, did not dare to call his miracles in question, <a href="/john/15-24.htm">John 15:24</a>. While they admitted the miracle, they attempted to trace it to the influence of Beelzebub, <a href="/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>; <a href="/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a>. So decided and numerous were the miracles of Jesus, that Peter here appeals to them as having been known by the Jews themselves to have been performed, and with a confidence that even riley could not deny it. On this he proceeds to rear his argument for the truth of his Messiahship. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-28. a man approved of God&#8212;rather, "authenticated," "proved," or "demonstrated to be from God."<p>by miracles &#8230; which God did by him&#8212;This is not a low view of our Lord's miracles, as has been alleged, nor inconsistent with Joh 2:11, but is in strict accordance with His progress from humiliation to glory, and with His own words in Joh 5:19.

Only the apostle having finished the vindication of his brethren, and the whole society, and set that matter in a clear light; and being willing to take this opportunity of preaching Christ to the Jews, addresses them under another character in a new form of words, though to the same sense as in <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a> in order to soften their minds, and raise their attention, and proceeds to describe the person, the subject of his following discourse: <p>Jesus of Nazareth; first by his name Jesus, which the angel gave him before his birth; and that for this reason, because he is the Saviour of his people from their sins, and which his name signifies; and next by the place, not where he was born, for that was Bethlehem, but where he was educated and brought up, and where he lived the greatest part of his life, Nazareth, a city in Galilee; whence he was so called, generally by way of contempt, and not so much to distinguish him from any of the same name: <p>a man approved of God; he was truly and really a man, who in his incarnation assumed a true body, and a reasonable soul; but he was not a mere man, and much less a common and ordinary man: he was the famous son of man the Scriptures speak of; the man of God's right hand, the man his fellow, a great, mighty, and wonderful man: "approved by God"; or shown, declared, and demonstrated by him, to be sent by him in human nature, to be the true Messiah and Saviour of the world, who was the chosen of God, loved and honoured by him, whom he sealed, and bore a testimony to; and that not privately, but openly and publicly: <p>among you; in the face of all the people in Jerusalem, and in the temple, and at the time of public feasts: <p>by miracles, and wonders, and signs; by dispossessing devils, cleansing lepers, restoring sight to the blind, causing the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk, and by raising the dead: <p>which God did by him in the midst of you; not but that he did the miracles himself, as and the Son of God; but as he was man, God did them, by his human nature, as the instrument: the meaning is, that his miracles were wrought by a divine power, and not by a diabolical influence, by Beelzebub the prince of devils, as the Pharisees blasphemously said of him; and these were done, not in a corner, but in the midst of them: <p>as ye yourselves also know; for they must be sensible and convicted in their own consciences, not only that these things were done by him, but that they could not be done by him, unless God was with him, or he was from God; and so were testimonies both of the divine approbation of him, and of his deity and Messiahship. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</span><p>(5) Christ, being innocent, was by God's providence crucified by wicked men.<p>(o) Who is by those works which God did by him so manifestly approved and admitted of, that no man can deny him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/2-22.htm" title="You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the middle of you, as you yourselves also know:">Acts 2:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τούτους</span>] like <span class="greekheb">τούτο</span>, <a href="/acts/2-14.htm" title="But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my words:">Acts 2:14</a>, the words <span class="ital">which</span> <span class="ital">follow</span>.

The phrase means “a man demonstrated to have come unto you from God by mighty works,” etc. If the words may not be pressed to mean our Lord’s divine origin, they at least declare His divine mission (<a href="/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>), <span class="ital">divinitus</span> (Wendt <span class="ital">in loco</span>).—<span class="greekheb">δυνάμεσι καὶ τέρασι καὶ σημείοις</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm" title="God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?">Hebrews 2:4</a>, and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα</span>: no less than eight times in Acts.—<span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span> is often rendered in a way which rather obscures its true form and meaning. Lit[126] = “powers,” and so here in R.V. margin, where in the text we have “mighty works,” so in <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm" title="God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?">Hebrews 2:4</a>. St. Luke is fond of using <span class="greekheb">δύναμις</span> of the power inherent in Christ, and so the plural might well be used of the outward manifestations of this power in Christ, or through Him in His disciples. The word therefore seems in itself to point to the new forces at work in the world (Trench, <span class="ital">N. T. Synonyms</span>, ii., p. 177 ff.).—<span class="greekheb">τέρατα</span>: the word is never used in the N. T. alone as applied to our Lord’s works or those of His disciples, and this observation made by Origen is very importaut, since the one word which might seem to suggest the prodigies and portents of the heathen world is never used unless in combination with some other word, which at once raises the N.T. miracles to a higher level. And so whilst the ethical purpose of these miracles is least apparent in the word <span class="greekheb">τέρατα</span>, it is brought distinctly into view by the word with which <span class="greekheb">τέρατα</span> is so often joined—<span class="greekheb">σημεῖα</span>, a term which points in its very meaning to something beyond itself. Blass therefore is not justified in speaking of <span class="greekheb">σημεῖα</span> and <span class="greekheb">τέρατα</span> as synonymous terms. The true distinction between them lies in remembering that in the N.T. all three words mentioned in this passage have the same denotation but a different connotation—they are all used for miracles, but miracles regarded from different points of view (see Sanday and Headlam, <span class="ital">Romans</span>, p. 406).—<span class="greekheb">οἷς ἐποίησεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς</span>. The words, as Alford points out against De Wette, do not express a low view of our Lord’s miracles. The favourite word used by St. John for the miracles of Christ, <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span>, exactly corresponds to the phrase of St. Peter, since these <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> were the works of the Father Whom the Son revealed in them (<span class="ital">cf.</span> St. <a href="/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>; <a href="/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>).—<span class="greekheb">καθὼς καὶ αὐτοὶ οἴδατε</span>: Weiss rightly draws attention to the emphatic pronoun. The fact of the miracles was not denied, although their source was so terribly misrepresented; <span class="ital">cf.</span> “Jesus Christ in the Talmud,” Laible, E.T. (Streane), pp. 45–50 (1893).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[126] literal, literally.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22–36</span>.

The first name, <span class="ital">miracles</span>, lit. <span class="bld">powers</span>, is applied to them because they proclaimed the might of Him who wrought them; they are named <span class="ital">wonders</span>, because they called forth that feeling when they were wrought; and <span class="ital">signs</span> because they point out their author as Divine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God did</span>] St Peter does not yet advance to the declaration of Christ as God, only as God’s agent, in works which their own eyes had seen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/2-22.htm" title="You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the middle of you, as you yourselves also know:">Acts 2:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦν τὸν Ναζωραῖον</span>, <span class="ital">Jesus of Nazareth</span>) Whom ye know.

This title includes both the Jews of Judaea and all those of the dispersion, to whatever tribe they belonged. <span class="cmt_word">Approved of God</span>. Observe the distinct reference to the miracles of Christ, as the proofs that he came from God, the authenticating evidences of his Divine mission. So St. Peter again, in his address to Cornelius, declares how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). The miracles of the gospel are, and were intended to be, a demonstration of the truth of Christianity, and it is at their peril that Christians allow themselves to give up this argument at the bidding of the skeptic. <span class="cmt_word">Mighty works and wonders and signs</span>. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> are <span class="accented">powers</span>, acts of healing and such like, done by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit (see the above reference to <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">wonders</span> or <span class="accented">portents</span>, such as are spoken of by the Prophet Joel, "wonders in heaven above," the darkening of the sun, the discoloration or the moon, or any ether wonder considered only with reference to its portentous character; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">signs</span>, not necessarily miraculous, but things which are proofs, either by their miraculous character or from the time or mode of their occurrence, of the truth of the things spoken. "Miracles, wonders, and signs" occur together in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>. The three seem to include every kind of miracle, or, as Meyer says, miracles viewed <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to their <span class="accented">nature,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> according to their <span class="accented">appearance,</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> according to their <span class="accented">destination</span> or proposed end. <span class="cmt_word">Which God did by him</span>. So we read <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "Through [or 'by'] whom also he made the worlds." And so our Lord said of himself, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work;" and "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do" (<a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 19</a>; comp. <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). On the other hand, our Lord often speaks of his own power, as <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>; <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a> (comp. <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). As Mediator, Christ did all things by his Father's appointment, and for his Father's glory, Even as ye yours, elves know. Mark the confidence with which Peter appeals to their personal knowledge of the miracles of Christ. This was a fitting preparation for the announcement of that mighty power, wonder, and sign which he was now about to proclaim to them - the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Approved (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb means to point out or shew forth.
