His account of the miraculous pouring forth of the Spirit, was designed to awaken the hearers to embrace the faith of Christ, and to join themselves to his church. It was the fulfilling the Scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection and ascension, and proof of both. Though Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance, yet he did not think to set aside the Scriptures. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given, not to do away the Scriptures, but to enable us to understand, approve, and obey them.

But as the idea of the people of God has its realization, so far as the history of redemption is concerned, in the collective body of believers on Christ without distinction of nations; so also in the Messianic fulfilment of that prophecy meant by Peter, and now begun, what the prophet has promised <span class="ital">to all flesh</span> is not to be understood of the Jewish people as such (van Hengel, appealing to <a href="/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>), but of all the true people of God, <span class="ital">so far as they believe on Christ</span>.

The fulfilment of this part of the prophecy had, it is true, not yet taken place among the members of the Christian people of God, but was still before them as a consequence of the communication of the Spirit which had just occurred; Peter, however, quotes the words as already fulfilled (<a href="/acts/2-16.htm" title="But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;">Acts 2:16</a>), because their fulfilment was necessarily conditioned by the outpouring of the Spirit, and was consequently already in idea included in it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΑΝΊΣΚΟΙ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΠΡΕΣΒΎΤΕΡΟΙ</span></span></span> belong likewise, as the preceding clause (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹΟῚ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΘΥΓΑΤΈΡΕς</span></span></span>), to the representation of the collective body as illustrated <span class="ital">per</span> <span class="greekheb">μερισμόν</span>.
