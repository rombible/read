It was remarkable that they should speak in this manner, because:<p>(1) They were ignorant, rude, and uncivilized, <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>. Hence, the term Galilean was used as an expression of the deepest reproach and contempt, <a href="/mark/14-70.htm">Mark 14:70</a>; <a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>.<p>(2) Their dialect was proverbially barbarous and corrupt, <a href="/mark/14-70.htm">Mark 14:70</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>. They were regarded as an outlandish people, unacquainted with other nations and languages, and hence, the amazement that they could address them in the refined language of other people. Their native ignorance was the occasion of making the miracle more striking. The native weakness of Christian ministers makes the grace and glory of God more remarkable in the success of the gospel. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us," <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>. The success which God often grants to those who are of slender endowments and of little learning, though blessed with an humble and pious heart, is often amazing to the people of the world. God has "chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise," <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>. This should teach us that no talent or attainment is too humble to be employed for mighty purposes, in its proper sphere, in the kingdom of Christ; and that pious effort may accomplish much, and then burn in heaven with increasing luster for ever, while pride, and learning, and talent may blaze uselessly among people, and then be extinguished in eternal night. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-11. there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every nation&#8212;not, it would seem, permanently settled there (see Ac 2:9), though the language seems to imply more than a temporary visit to keep this one feast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Without literature, or good education, they being worse thought of on that account than the ordinary sort of that nation were; besides, they thought no prophet was to be expected from Galilee, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-46.htm" title="And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?

It is therefore foreign to the matter, with Herder, Heinrichs, Olshausen, Schulz, Rossteuscher, van Hengel, and older commentators, to bring into prominence the accessory idea of want of culture (<span class="ital">uncultivated Galileans</span>); and erroneous, with Stolz, Eichhorn, Kuinoel, and others, to consider <span class="greekheb">Γαλ</span>. as a designation of the <span class="ital">Christian sect</span>—a designation, evidence of which, moreover, can only be adduced from a later period.
