Reading Psalms 16 without this interpretation, it seems as if it spoke only of the confidence of the writer that he would be himself delivered from the grave and death. Some interpreters confine that confidence to a temporal deliverance; some extend it to the thought of immortality, or even of a resurrection. But Peter had been taught, both by his Lord and by the Spirit, that all such hopes extend beyond themselves—that the ideal of victory after suffering, no less than that of the righteous sufferer, was realised in Christ. The fact of the Resurrection had given a new meaning to prophecies which would not, of themselves, have suggested it, but which were incomplete without it.<p><span class= "bld">He is on my</span> <span class= "bld">right hand.</span>—The Psalmist thought of the Eternal as the warrior thinks of him who, in the conflict of battle, extends his shield over the comrade who is on the left hand, and so guards him from attack.

He set his Father’s glory before him as his end, and his Father’s will as his rule, in every part of it. And he foresaw that his sufferings would redound abundantly to the honour of God, and would issue in his own everlasting joy and felicity. These things were set before him, and these he had an eye to in all he did and suffered; and with the prospect of these, he was supported and carried on. <span class="ital">He is on my right hand </span>— The instrument of action, strengthening, upholding, and guiding it; <span class="ital">that I should not be moved </span>— Shaken in, or driven from, my undertaking, by the hardships I must undergo. <span class="ital">Therefore, </span>&c. — On account of the firm confidence I had in him, that I should be supported in, and carried through all my labours and sufferings, and that they should have a glorious issue; <span class="ital">my heart rejoiced </span>in the midst of them; <span class="ital">and my tongue was glad — </span>Praised God in a joyful manner. In the Psalm it is, <span class="ital">My glory rejoiceth: </span>for our tongue is our glory; the faculty of speech is an honour to us; and never more so than when it is employed in praising God. <span class="ital">Moreover my flesh shall rest in hope </span>— The grave shall be to my body a bed of repose, and I shall cheerfully deliver it up to be laid there, in hope of a blessed resurrection. <span class="ital">Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εις αδου</span>, in the invisible world.

Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Daniel speaketh ... - This doctrine that the Messiah must rise from the dead Peter proceeds to prove by a quotation from the Old Testament. This passage is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8-11</a>. It is made from the Greek version of the Septuagint, with only one slight and unimportant change. Nor is there any material change, as will be seen, from the Hebrew. In what sense this Psalm can be applied to Christ will be seen after we have examined the expressions which Peter alleges.<p>I foresaw the Lord - This is an unhappy translation. To foresee the Lord always before us conveys no idea, though it may be a literal translation of the passage. The word means "to foresee," and then "to see before us," that is, "as present with us, to regard as being near." It thus implies "to put confidence in one; to rely on him, or expect assistance from him." This is its meaning here. The Hebrew is, "I expected, or waited for." It thus expresses the petition of one who is helpless and dependent, who waits for help from God. It is often thus used in the Old Testament.<p>Always before my face - As being always present to help me, and to deliver me out of all my troubles.<p>He is on my right hand - To be at hand is to be near to afford help. The right hand is mentioned because that was the place of dignity and honor. David did not design simply to say that he was near to help him, but that he had the place of honor, the highest place in his affections, <a href="/psalms/109-31.htm">Psalm 109:31</a>. In our dependence on God we should exalt him. We should not merely regard him as our help, but should at the same time give him the highest place in our affections.<p>That I should not be moved - That is, that no great evil or calamity should happen to me; that I may stand firm. The phrase denotes "to sink into calamities, or to fall into the power of enemies," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/62-6.htm">Psalm 62:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-6.htm">Psalm 46:6</a>. This expresses the confidence of one who is in danger of great calamities, and who puts his trust in the help of God alone. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. was not possible he should be holden of it&#8212;Glorious saying!

Thus, in all troubles, there is no such approved comfort, as the seeing or acknowledging the will of God concerning them, his power to preserve us under them, and his promises to deliver us from them.

David, if the Psalm, which yet certainly is later, belonged to him, or the other suffering theocrat who here speaks, is, in what he affirms of himself, a prophetic type of the <span class="ital">Messiah</span>; what he says of the certainty that he should not succumb to the danger of death, which threatened him, has received its antitypical fulfilment in Christ by His resurrection from the dead. This <span class="ital">historical</span> Messianic <span class="ital">fulfillment</span> of the Psalm justified the apostle in its Messianic <span class="ital">interpretation</span>, in which he has on his side not rabbinical predecessors (see Schoettgen), but the Apostle Paul (<a href="/acts/13-35.htm" title="Why he said also in another psalm, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 13:35</a> f.). The <span class="greekheb">προωρώμην κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., as the LXX. translates <span class="greekheb">שִׁוּיחִי</span>, is, according to this ideal Messianic understanding of the Psalm, Christ’s joyful expression of His continued fellowship with God on earth, since in fact (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) God is by His side protecting and preserving Him; I foresaw the Lord before my face always, i.e. looking before me with the mind’s glance (Xen.

The figurative element of the expression is borrowed from courts of justice, where the advocates stood at the right of their clients, <a href="/psalms/109-31.htm" title="For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.">Psalm 109:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ σαλευθῶ</span>] without figure: that I may remain unmoved in the state of my salvation.

But if the following Psalm and the Psalm in question may with considerable reason be attributed to the same author, and if the former Psalm, the seventeenth, may be referred to the period of David’s persecution by Saul, then David’s authorship of Psalm sixteen becomes increasingly probable (Kirkpatrick). In Delitzsch’s view whatever can mark a Psalm as Davidic we actually find combined here, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, coincidences of many kinds which he regards as undoubtedly Davidic (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/5-5.htm" title="And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.">Acts 5:5</a> with <a href="/acts/11-6.htm" title="On the which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw four footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.">Acts 11:6</a>, <a href="/acts/5-10.htm" title="Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.">Acts 5:10</a> with <a href="/acts/4-4.htm" title="However, many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.">Acts 4:4</a>, <a href="/acts/5-11.htm" title="And great fear came on all the church, and on as many as heard these things.">Acts 5:11</a> with <a href="/acts/17-15.htm" title="And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.">Acts 17:15</a>), and he sees no reason for giving up the testimony afforded by the title. But it is plain that David’s experience did not exhaust the meaning of the Psalm, and St. Peter in the fulness of the gift of Pentecost interprets the words <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν</span>, “with reference to Him,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Messiah (<span class="ital">cf.</span> St. Paul’s interpretation of the same Psalm in <a href="/acts/13-35.htm" title="Why he said also in another psalm, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 13:35</a>).

In its <span class="ital">literal</span> meaning, therefore, there is no reference to the rest of the body in the grave, or to the hope of resurrection from the grave, but the words must be understood of <span class="ital">this life</span> (Perowne); <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm" title="And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm" title="Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be on a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>, <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm" title="I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for you, LORD, only make me dwell in safety.">Psalm 4:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-13.htm" title="His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.">Psalm 25:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm" title="In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name with which she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.">Jeremiah 33:16</a>. For the hope of the Psalmist, expressed in the following words, is primarily for preservation from death: “Thou wilt not give up my soul to Sheol [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to the underworld, so that one becomes its prey], neither wilt thou suffer thy beloved one [singular] to see the pit” (so Delitzsch and Perowne, as also R.

The sixteenth psalm is ascribed to David in the title prefixed to it in the Hebrew and the LXX. Without pronouncing the titles to be infallible, we must confess that they carry great weight with them in the absence of any strong internal evidence against them. Meyer speaks of the psalm as "certainly later than David," and Ewald and others ascribe it to the time of the Captivity; but Hitzig thinks the internal evidence is in favor of its belonging to the time before David ascended the throne ('Speaker's Commentary'). We may safely rest on the authority of St. Peter here and St. Paul (<a href="/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35, 36</a>), and be satisfied that it is really David's. The manner in which it is quoted by the two apostles is also very strong evidence that by the Jews of that day it was generally admitted to be a Messianic psalm.
