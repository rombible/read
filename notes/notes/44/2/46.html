<a href="/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31</a>; <a href="/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?">John 7:45</a>), should keep aloof from the sanctuary that had thus been desecrated. But they remembered that He had claimed it as His Father’s house, that His zeal for that house had been as a consuming passion (<a href="/context/john/2-16.htm" title="And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.">John 2:16-17</a>), and therefore they had attended its worship daily before the Day of Pentecost (<a href="/luke/24-53.htm" title="And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.">Luke 24:53</a>); and it was not less, but infinitely more, precious to them now, as the place where they could meet with God, than it had been in the days of ignorance, before they had known the Christ, and through Him had learnt to know the Father. The apparent strangeness of their being allowed to meet in the Temple is explained partly by the fact that its courts were open to all Israelites who did not disturb its peace, partly by the existence of a moderate half-believing party in the Sanhedrin itself, including Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathæa, and Gamaliel (<a href="/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35</a>); and by the popularity gained for a time by the holiness and liberal almsgiving of the new community.<p><span class= "bld">Breaking bread from house to house.</span>—Better, with the margin, <span class= "ital">at home</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in their own house. The Greek phrase may have a distributive force, but <a href="/romans/16-5.htm" title="Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.">Romans 16:5</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-14.htm" title=" Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.">Colossians 4:14</a>, where the same formula is used, seem to show that that is not the meaning here. They met in the Temple, they met also in what, in the modern sense of the word, would be the “church” of the new society, for the act of worship, above all, for the highest act of worship and of fellowship, for which the Temple was, of course, unsuitable.<p><span class= "bld">Did eat their meat</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>—We have again the tense which implies a customary act. The words imply that as yet the solemn breaking of bread was closely connected with their daily life. Anticipating the language of a few years later, the Agapè, or Love-feast, was united with the Eucharistic Communion. The higher sanctified the lower. It was not till love and faith were colder that men were forced to separate them, lest (as in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-21</a>) the lower should desecrate the higher.<p><span class= "bld">Gladness and singleness of heart.</span>—This “gladness” is significant. The word was the same as that which had been used by the angel to Zacharias (<a href="/luke/1-44.htm" title="For, see, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.">Luke 1:44</a>) in announcing the birth of the Forerunner. The verb from which the noun was derived had been employed by our Lord when He bade His disciples rejoice and be glad (<a href="/matthew/5-12.htm" title="Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.">Matthew 5:12</a>). The literal meaning of the word translated “singleness,” which does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, was the smoothness of a soil without stones. Thence it came to be used for evenness and simplicity, unity of character; thence for that unity showing itself in love; thence, by a further transition, for unalloyed benevolence, showing itself in act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,...">Acts 2:46-47</a></span>. <span class="ital">And continuing daily with one accord </span>— With unanimity and fraternal affection; <span class="ital">in the temple </span>— At the appointed hours of public service. This was their place of rendezvous: and here they worshipped not only on sabbaths, and solemn feast-days, but <span class="ital">every day: </span>for to worship God is the daily work of a true Christian, and where there is opportunity, the oftener it is done publicly the better. God loveth the gates of Zion, and so must we: and to have fellowship with God in his ordinances, is the best fellowship we can have with one another. <span class="ital">And breaking bread from house</span> <span class="ital">to house </span>— For they associated as frequently as they could at other times, each family that was of ability entertaining their brethren, especially those that were sojourners in Jerusalem; <span class="ital">they eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart </span>— With the greatest joy, on the part of those who made the entertainments; and with disinterested simplicity of heart, in those who received them; and on all sides with the sincerest sentiments of devotion and friendship. Thus did these first Christians carry the same holy and happy temper in which they worshipped God, through all their common actions, eating and working with the same spirit wherewith they prayed, and received the Lord’s supper! <span class="ital">Praising God </span>— For the riches of his grace to them, for the wonderful things he had done for them, in redeeming them by the life, death, and resurrection of his Son, for the assurances he had given them of their justification and regeneration through him, and for the bright prospects he had opened before them, of glory and felicity for ever in his presence and kingdom. <span class="ital">Having favour with all the people </span>— That is, with the generality of them, particularly the common people. So wonderfully had the <span class="ital">fear, </span>spoken of <a href="/acts/2-43.htm" title="And fear came on every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.">Acts 2:43</a>, the signs and wonders wrought by the apostles, and the astonishing events which had taken place, restrained the spirit of persecution; which, however, was soon revived, and broke forth in all its fury: and no wonder; for the carnal mind will still be <span class="ital">enmity against God, </span>however the outward manifestations of that enmity may, on certain occasions, be checked for a season. In this remarkable passage, then, we have a striking picture of the primitive church, and that in its first days: its state of infancy, indeed, but the state of its greatest innocence. 1st, The members of it were regular in their attendance on holy ordinances, and abounded in all instances of piety and devotion. For Christianity, received in the power of it, will cause men to delight in communion with God in all those ways wherein he has commanded us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. They were, therefore, constant in their attendance on the preaching of the word; frequently received the Lord’s supper, celebrating that memorial of their Master’s death, as persons who were not ashamed to own their relation to, and dependance upon him, who had been crucified; they continued instant in prayer, social and public, as well as private; and abounded in praise and thanksgiving. 2d, Their charity was as eminent as their piety, their joining together in holy ordinances tending greatly to endear them to one another, and to unite them together in disinterested friendship and brotherly affection. Hence they were peculiarly loving and kind to one another, had a deep concern for each other’s welfare, and were constantly ready to help each other in any way in their power, suffering no one to want what another had. 3d, God owned them for his people, giving daily and signal tokens of his presence with them, and delight in them, bearing testimony to the word of his grace, and causing his power so to attend the ministration of it, that the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified, his kingdom enlarged, and multitudes, both of men and women, were added to the society of the faithful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">O, what an age of golden days!

They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted in the power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, and the Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be to another as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroying property, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God who moved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from their possessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts of more to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as were actually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being made partakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed for eternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till the earth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With one accord - Compare <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>.<p>In the temple - This was the public place of worship; and the disciples were not disposed to leave the place where their fathers had so long worshipped God. This does not mean that they were constantly in the temple, but only at the customary hours of prayer - at nine o'clock in the morning, and at three o'clock in the afternoon.<p>And breaking bread - See the notes on <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>.<p>From house to house - In the margin, "at home." So the Syriac and Arabic. The common interpretation, however, is, that they did it in their various houses, now in this and now in that, as might be convenient. If it refers to their ordinary meals, then it means that they partook in common of what they possessed, and the expression "did eat their meat" seems to imply that this refers to their common meals, and not to the Lord's Supper.<p>Did eat their meat - Did partake of their food. The word "meat" with us is applied to "flesh." In the Bible, and in Old English authors, it is applied to "provisions" of any kind. Here it means all kinds of sustenance; what nourished them - &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  trophe&#772;s - and the use of this word proves that it does not refer to the Lord's Supper; for that ordinance is nowhere represented as designed for an ordinary meal, or to nourish the body. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-33.htm">1 Corinthians 11:33-34</a>.<p>With gladness - With rejoicing. This is one of the effects of religion. It is far from gloom; it diffuses happiness over the mind; it bestows additional joy in the participation of even our ordinary pleasures.<p>Singleness of heart - This means with a sincere and pure heart. They were satisfied and thankful. They were not perplexed or anxious; nor were they solicitous for the luxurious living, or aspiring after the vain objects of the people of the world.

In the <span class="ital">Didache 1</span> the expression <span class="greekheb">κλάσατε ἄρτον</span>, chap. iv. 1, certainly refers to the Eucharist, and in the earlier chap. ix, where the word <span class="greekheb">κλάσμα</span> occurs twice in the sense of broken bread, it can scarcely refer to anything less than the <span class="ital">Agape</span> (Salmon, <span class="ital">Introd.</span>, p. 565, and Gore, <span class="ital">The Church and the Ministry</span>, p. 414, on the value of the Eucharistic teaching in the <span class="ital">Didache 1</span>).—<span class="greekheb">μετελ</span>.: the imperf. denotes a customary act, the meaning of the verb with the gen[133] as here is frequently found in classical Greek; <span class="ital">cf.</span> LXX, <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/18-9.htm" title="For the righteous children of good men did sacrifice secretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saints should be like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathers now singing out the songs of praise.">Wis 18:9</a>, 4Ma 8:8, AR., and <a href="/acts/16-18.htm" title="And this did she many days.

It is very remarkable that at this early age of the Church's existence Christians did not deem themselves separated from their Jewish brethren, or from the Old Testament institutions. Christianity was but Judaism perfected; the gospel the full blossoming of the Law. The first Christian Jews, therefore, did not conceive of themselves as quitting the religion of their fathers, but rather hoped that their whole nation would in a short time acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ. Christian institutions, therefore - the prayers, the breaking of bread, the prophesyings and speaking with tongues, and the apostolic teachings - were supplemental to the temple service, not antagonistic to it; and the church took the place rather of the synagogue than of the temple (see 'Dict. of Bible:' "Synagogue"). <span class="cmt_word">At home.</span> This version hardly represents the true idea of the original; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> represents the private Christian place of meeting, as contrasted with the temple. The meaning is not that every disciple broke bread in his own house, but that they broke bread at the house where the Christian assemblies were held, whether one or more. We have already seen the Church gathered together "in an upper room" (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), in "one place," in "a house" (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1, 2</a>), and "together" (ver. 44; see too <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>); and we know that as the synagogue was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, house of prayer, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, the house of assemblage, so the Christian place of meeting was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the Lord's house, whence the word "<span class="accented">church."</span> (For <span class="accented">breaking bread, see</span> above, ver. 42.)
