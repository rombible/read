But neither Peter's words, nor the miracle they witnessed, could have produced such effects, had not the Holy Spirit been given. Sinners, when their eyes are opened, cannot but be pricked to the heart for sin, cannot but feel an inward uneasiness. The apostle exhorted them to repent of their sins, and openly to avow their belief in Jesus as the Messiah, by being baptized in his name. Thus professing their faith in Him, they would receive remission of their sins, and partake of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit. To separate from wicked people, is the only way to save ourselves from them. Those who repent of their sins, and give up themselves to Jesus Christ, must prove their sincerity by breaking off from the wicked. We must save ourselves from them; which denotes avoiding them with dread and holy fear. By God's grace three thousand persons accepted the gospel invitation. There can be no doubt that the gift of the Holy Ghost, which they all received, and from which no true believer has ever been shut out, was that Spirit of adoption, that converting, guiding, sanctifying grace, which is bestowed upon all the members of the family of our heavenly Father. Repentance and remission of sins are still preached to the chief of sinners, in the Redeemer's name; still the Holy Spirit seals the blessing on the believer's heart; still the encouraging promises are to us and our children; and still the blessings are offered to all that are afar off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Many other words - This discourse, though one of the longest in the New Testament, is but an outline. It contains, however, the substance of the plan of salvation, and is admirably arranged to attain its object.<p>Testify - Bear witness to. He bore witness to the promises of Christianity; to the truths pertaining to the danger of sinners; and to the truth respecting the character of that generation.<p>Exhort - He entreated them by arguments and promises.<p>Save yourselves - This expression here denotes, preserve yourselves from the influence, opinions, and fate of this generation. It implies that they were to use diligence and effort to deliver themselves. God deals with people as free agents. He calls upon them to put forth their own power and effort to be saved. Unless they put forth their own strength, they will never be saved. When they are saved, they will ascribe to God the praise for having inclined them to seek him, and for the grace whereby they are saved.<p>This generation - This age or race of people; the Jews then living. They were not to apprehend danger from them from which they were to deliver themselves; but they were to apprehend danger from being with them, united in their plans; designs, and feelings. From the influence of their opinions, etc., they were to escape. That generation was signally corrupt and wicked. See <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a>; <a href="/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>. They had crucified the Messiah; and they were, for their sins, soon to be destroyed.<p>Order? this untoward generation? - Untoward: "Perverse, refractory, not easily guided or taught" (Webster). The same character our Saviour had given of that generation in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16-19</a>. This character they had shown uniformly. They were smooth, cunning, plausible; but they were corrupt in principle, and wicked in conduct. The Pharisees had a vast hold on the people. To break away from them was to set at defiance all their power and doctrines; to alienate themselves from their teachers and friends; to brave the authority of those in office, and those who had long claimed the right of teaching and guiding the nation. The chief danger of those who were now awakened was from that generation; that they would deride, or denounce, or persecute them, and induce them to abandon their seriousness, and turn back to their sins. And hence, Peter exhorted them at once to break off from them, and give themselves to Christ. We may hence learn:<p>(1) That if sinners will be saved they must make an effort. There is no promise to any unless they will exert themselves.<p>(2) the principal danger which besets those who are awakened arises from their former companions. They are often wicked, cunning, rich, mighty. They may be their kindred, and will seek to drive off their serious impressions by derision, or argument, or persecution. They have a powerful hold on the affections, and they will seek to use it to prevent those who are awakened from becoming Christians.<p>(3) those who are awakened should resolve at once to break off from their evil companions, and unite themselves to Christ and his people. There may be no other way in which this can be done than by resolving to forsake altogether the society of those who are infidels, and scoffers, and profane. They should forsake the world, and give themselves up to God, and resolve to have only so much contact with the world, in any respect, as may be required by duty, and as may be consistent with a supreme purpose to live to the honor of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. with many other words did he testify and exhort&#8212;Thus we have here but a summary of Peter's discourse; though from the next words it would seem that only the more practical parts, the home appeals, are omitted.<p>Save yourselves from this untoward generation&#8212;as if Peter already foresaw the hopeless impenitence of the nation at large, and would have his hearers hasten in for themselves and secure their own salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Many other words:</span> the sermons of the apostles, or of our Saviour, are not all set down by the holy writers; but only so much as God saw necessary for his church to know and believe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Testify and exhort; </span> using God’s name and authority, and calling him as it were to witness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Save yourselves:</span> no less than the salvation of our souls depends upon our forsaking wicked and profane persons in their ungodly courses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">From this untoward generation; </span> the whole world lies in wickedness; but especially the scribes and Pharisees, and other such declared enemies of Christ Jesus. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And with many other words did he testify and exhort,....

It must not, however, be forgotten that in other passages in the LXX the verb may mean to bear witness (see Hatch and Redpath, <span class="ital">sub v.</span>). In the N.T., as Wendt notes, it is used by St. Paul in the former sense of protesting solemnly in <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1 Timothy 5:21</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2 Timothy 2:14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;">2 Timothy 4:1</a>.

(<a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>), and the figure is made stronger by the literal rendering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/2-40.htm" title="And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.">Acts 2:40</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πλείοσι</span>, <span class="ital">with many more</span>) The truth must be pressed on men, until the desired result is effected.—<span class="greekheb">διεμαρτύρατο</span>, <span class="ital">he testified</span>) This refers to what goes before.—<span class="greekheb">παρεκάλει</span>, <span class="ital">he exhorted</span>) This refers to what follows.—<span class="greekheb">σώθητε</span>, <span class="ital">be saved</span>) <span class="ital">depart in a state of salvation</span>, without, delay.

Those who would not perish with them must come out from amongst them and be separate from them (<a href="/2_corinthians/6.htm">2 Corinthians 6</a>:19), and seek safely in the ark of Christ's Church (<a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>), as Noah did in the ark, and as Lot did in Zoar. So the jailer at Philippi, seeking to be saved, was baptized straightway (<a href="/acts/16-30.htm">Acts 16:30-33</a>). This was the drift and end of all St. Peter's exhortations. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Other (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>And various.<p>Did he testify (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>The preposition &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; gives the force of solemnly, earnestly.<p>Save yourselves (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>More strictly, be ye saved.<p>Untoward (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., crooked.
