He said, Yes.">Acts 22:27</a>; <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>, do we find the Hebrew form of the Benjamite name. It is as though he, who gloried in being above all things a Hebrew of the Hebrews, heard himself claimed as such by Him who spoke from heaven, called as Samuel had been called of old (<a href="/context/1_samuel/3-4.htm" title="That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.">1Samuel 3:4-8</a>), and having to decide whether he would resist to the end, or yield, saying with Samuel, “Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.” The narrative implies that the persecutor saw the form of the Son of Man as well as heard His voice, and to that visible presence the Apostle afterwards refers as a witness to him of the Resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1Corinthians 15:8</a>). If we ask as to the manner of the appearance, it is natural to think of it as being such as had met the gaze of Stephen. The martyr’s words, “I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God” (<a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>), had then seemed to the fiery zeal of the Pharisee as those of a blasphemer. Now he too saw the Son of Man in the glory of the Father stretching forth His hand, not now, as He then had done, to receive the servant who was faithful even unto death, but, in answer to that servant’s dying prayer, to transform the persecutor into the likeness of his victim.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 So ill informed was Saul, that he thought he ought to do all he could against the name of Christ, and that he did God service thereby; he seemed to breathe in this as in his element. Let us not despair of renewing grace for the conversion of the greatest sinners, nor let such despair of the pardoning mercy of God for the greatest sin. It is a signal token of Divine favour, if God, by the inward working of his grace, or the outward events of his providence, stops us from prosecuting or executing sinful purposes. Saul saw that Just One, ch. 22:14; 26:13. How near to us is the unseen world! It is but for God to draw aside the veil, and objects are presented to the view, compared with which, whatever is most admired on earth is mean and contemptible. Saul submitted without reserve, desirous to know what the Lord Jesus would have him to do. Christ's discoveries of himself to poor souls are humbling; they lay them very low, in mean thoughts of themselves. For three days Saul took no food, and it pleased God to leave him for that time without relief. His sins were now set in order before him; he was in the dark concerning his own spiritual state, and wounded in spirit for sin. When a sinner is brought to a proper sense of his own state and conduct, he will cast himself wholly on the mercy of the Saviour, asking what he would have him to do. God will direct the humbled sinner, and though he does not often bring transgressors to joy and peace in believing, without sorrows and distress of conscience, under which the soul is deeply engaged as to eternal things, yet happy are those who sow in tears, for they shall reap in joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he fell to the earth - He was astonished and overcome by the sudden flash of light. There is a remarkable similarity between what occurred here, and what is recorded of Daniel in regard to the visions which he saw, <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>. Also <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8</a>, "Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision; and there remained no strength in me, for my comeliness (vigor) was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength." The effect was such as to overpower the body.<p>And heard a voice - The whole company heard a voice <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>, but did not distinguish it as addressed particularly to Saul. He heard it speaking to himself.<p>Saying unto him ... - This shows that it was not thunder, as many have supposed. It was a distinct articulation or utterance, addressing him by name.<p>Saul, Saul - A mode of address that is emphatic. The repetition of the name would fix his attention. Thus, Jesus addresses Martha <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41</a>, and Simon <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31</a>, and Jerusalem <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>.<p>Why - For what reason.

In <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a> all fall to the ground, but there is no contradiction with <a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>, see below on <a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>. Lewin, Farrar (so Hackett, and some early interpreters) have held that Saul and some at least of his companions were mounted, since Saul was the emissary of the high priest, and the journey would occupy some days. On the other hand Felten (following Corn, à Lapide) holds that the text makes no suggestion of this, and that the expression “they led him by the hand” and the command “rise and enter into the city” are against it; but the near neighbourhood of Damascus might easily account for the fact that his companions led Saul by the hand for the remaining distance, which could not have been long, although the immediate proximity of the traditional site cannot be maintained (see above on <a href="/acts/9-3.htm" title="And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:">Acts 9:3</a>). As the strict Jews, like the Pharisees, seldom used horses, Felten may be right in conjecturing that Saul rode upon an ass or a mule (p. 186, note).—<span class="greekheb">ἤκουσε φωνὴν λέγουσαν</span>: in St. Paul’s own account we have <span class="greekheb">ἤκουσα φωνῆς λεγούσης</span>, <a href="/acts/22-7.htm" title="And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 22:7</a>, and <span class="greekheb">ἤκουσα φωνὴν λέγ</span>., as here, in <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>. It would seem therefore that the distinction between <span class="greekheb">ἀκούειν</span> with (1) accusative, and (2) genitive; (1) to hear and understand, (2) to hear, merely, cannot be pressed (so Alford, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and Simcox, <span class="ital">Language of N. T.</span>, p. 90, and Weiss on <a href="/acts/22-7.htm" title="And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 22:7</a>; but see on the other hand Rendall on 9 <a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>). Thus in the passage before us it has been usual to explain <span class="greekheb">ἀκούειν</span> with <span class="greekheb">φωνήν</span> <a href="/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4</a>, as indicating that Saul not only heard but understood the voice, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a>, whilst <span class="greekheb">ἀκούειν</span> with <span class="greekheb">φωνῆς</span> <a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>, has been taken to show that his comrades heard, but did not understand (so Weiss, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and also on <a href="/acts/22-9.htm" title="And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.">Acts 22:9</a>).

But (2) on comparing the passages together, it appears that in <a href="/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4</a>; <a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a> a distinction is drawn between the contents of the utterance and the mere sound of the voice, a distinction drawn by the accusative and genitive; in <a href="/acts/22-7.htm" title="And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 22:7</a> the same distinction is really maintained, and by the same cases, since in <a href="/acts/22-7.htm" title="And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 22:7</a> Paul, in speaking of himself, says that he heard a voice, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, was conscious of a voice speaking to him (genitive, <span class="greekheb">φωνῆς</span>), (Simcox, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 85), whilst in <a href="/acts/9-9.htm" title="And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.">Acts 9:9</a> (accusative <span class="greekheb">φωνήν</span>) the contents of the utterance are referred to, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/9-14.htm" title="And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.">Acts 9:14</a> in the same chapter; in <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a> the accusative is rightly used for the contents of the utterance which are given there more fully than elsewhere.—<span class="greekheb">Σαούλ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Σαούλ</span>: in each of the three narratives of the Conversion it is significant that the Hebrew form is thus given, and it is also found in the address of Ananias, probably himself a Hebrew, <a href="/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>, to the new convert.

From <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a> we find that not only Saul but his companions were struck down by the light, though there was more in the vision which he beheld than was made evident to them, and by reason of the greater glory which was manifested to him, his natural sight was blinded.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and heard a voice</span>] We cannot represent in English the different case of the noun in this verse, and in 7. The Greek puts here the accusative case and there the genitive, and thus indicates that there was <span class="bld">a</span> difference in the nature of the hearing of Saul and of his companions. And Paul in <a href="/acts/22-9.htm" title="And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.">Acts 22:9</a> marks the distinction in his own narration, for he says “They heard not the voice (accusative) of him that spake to me.” As this difference is made both in St Luke’s first account, and in the speech of St Paul at Jerusalem, it seems reasonable to accept the explanation which has long ago been given of this grammatical variation, and to understand that Saul heard an articulate sound, a voice which spake to him, while his companions were only conscious of a sound from which they comprehended nothing. St Paul then is precise when he says “they heard not the voice” which I heard, and St Luke is correct when in <span class="ital"><a href="/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a></span> he says “they heard a sound.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span>] It is very noteworthy that in all the three accounts of the vision the Greek text of Saul’s name is a transliteration of the Hebrew, shewing that we have here a very close adherence to the words of Jesus. The Lord spake in the language of His people, and both the Evangelist and the Apostle have preserved for us this remarkable feature of the heavenly address. The only other place where the Hebrew form of Saul’s name is retained is in the speech of Ananias when (<a href="/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>) he comes to see the convert in his blindness. As he also had received a communication from Jesus in connection with Saul’s conversion, we can understand how the same form of the name would have been given to him. Moreover he was himself, to judge from his name, a Hebrew, and therefore that form would be most natural on his lips. Except in these cases St Luke always employs the Greek form of the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christ speaks of Himself as persecuted by Saul, because “in all the affliction of his people he is afflicted” (<a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>), and “whoso toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye” (<a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; After the glory has he sent me to the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.">Zechariah 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Φωνὴν</span>, <span class="ital">a voice</span>) stern, and yet full of grace: ch. <a href="/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a>.—<span class="greekheb">Σαοὺλ</span>, <span class="ital">Saul</span>) JESUS knew Saul before that Saul knew JESUS.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Fell upon</span>, for <span class="accented">fell to</span>, A.V. Some, as Lord Lytlelton and Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 48), from the expressions, "fell to the ground," "fell to the earth," infer that Saul was "himself mounted, and his followers some mounted and some on foot." And Farrar also, far other reasons, supposes that Saul and his companions rode horses or mules. The journey, he says, was nearly a hundred and fifty miles, and the roads rough, bad, and steep; and Saul was traveling as the <span class="accented">legate or</span> the high priest. Still it is strange that no one expression should point distinctly to the party being on horseback, which "falling to the earth," or "ground," certainly do not. While, on the other hand, the phrases, "Arise," "stood speechless," "led him by the hand," seem rather to point to his being on foot. Lunge well compares the double invocation, <span class="cmt_word">Saul, Saul</span>! with those similar ones, "Abraham, Abraham!" "Samuel, Samuel!" "Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" "Simon, Simon!"
