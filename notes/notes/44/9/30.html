At Cæsarea he would probably, as afterwards in <a href="/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>, find Philip, and the friend and the accuser of the proto-martyr met face to face as brethren. In returning to his home at Tarsus, from which he had been absent at the least for four years, and possibly for a much longer period, it would be natural for him to resume his old employment as a tent-maker. (See Note on <a href="/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>.) Thence, as from a centre, he did his work as an Evangelist in the regions of Cilicia (<a href="/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a>), where, in <a href="/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>, we find churches already organised, which had not been founded in what we call the first mission journey of Paul and Barnabas, and must therefore have been planted by the former at an earlier period. Here, for the present, we lose sight of him. It need hardly be said that the Cæsarea here spoken of is that on the sea-coast. Cæsarea Philippi is always distinguished by its special epithet.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:23-31 When we enter into the way of God, we must look for trials; but the Lord knows how to deliver the godly, and will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape. Though Saul's conversion was and is a proof of the truth of Christianity, yet it could not, of itself, convert one soul at enmity with the truth; for nothing can produce true faith, but that power which new-creates the heart. Believers are apt to be too suspicious of those against whom they have prejudices. The world is full of deceit, and it is necessary to be cautious, but we must exercise charity, 1Co 13:5. The Lord will clear up the characters of true believers; and he will bring them to his people, and often gives them opportunities of bearing testimony to his truth, before those who once witnessed their hatred to it. Christ now appeared to Saul, and ordered him to go quickly out of Jerusalem, for he must be sent to the Gentiles: see ch. 22:21. Christ's witnesses cannot be slain till they have finished their testimony. The persecutions were stayed. The professors of the gospel walked uprightly, and enjoyed much comfort from the Holy Ghost, in the hope and peace of the gospel, and others were won over to them. They lived upon the comfort of the Holy Ghost, not only in the days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest and prosperity. Those are most likely to walk cheerfully, who walk circumspectly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To Cesarea - See the notes on <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>.<p>And sent him forth to Tarsus - This was his native city.

But Paul had another reason than his own apprehension for quitting Jerusalem so soon. "While he was praying in the temple, he was in a trance," and received express injunctions to this effect.

As this was his first visit to his native city since his conversion, so it is not certain that he ever was there again. (See on [1978]Ac 11:25). It probably was now that he became the instrument of gathering into the fold of Christ those "kinsmen," that "sister," and perhaps her "son," of whom mention is made in Ac 23:16, &c.; Ro 16:7, 11, 21 [Howson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Caesarea; </span> there were two towns of this name, one a coast town, spoken of, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a></span>; the other was called Caesarea Philippi, nigh Mount Lebanon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tarsus, </span> St. Paul’s birth place, where amongst his relations and acquaintance they might hope he would be safe. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which when the brethren knew,....

But if so, there is no contradiction with <a href="/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a>, where Paul speaks of coming into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, as if hwent to the latter through the former. The expressions in <span class="ital">Galatians</span> have sometimes been explained on the supposition that the two countries, Syria and Cilicia, are named there as elsewhere in that order, <a href="/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a>; <a href="/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>, as a kind of general geographical expression (Felten), the most important country being mentioned first, so Lightfoot, Nösgen, Conybeare and Howson; or that as Paul would remain at Syrian ports on the way to Cilicia, he might fairly speak as he does, or that he went first to Tarsus, and thence made missionary excursions into Syria. If neither of these or similar explanations are satisfactory, we can scarcely conclude with Blass that <a href="/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a> is accounted for “inverso per incuriam ordine”. Ramsay has lately argued with much force that here as elsewhere Paul thinks and speaks of the Roman divisions of the empire (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung in das N. T.</span>, i., p. 124 (1897)), and that here the two great divisions, Syria and Cilicia, of the Roman province are spoken of; and he accordingly reads, with the original text of [232], <span class="greekheb">τὰ κλίματα τῆς Σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ Κ</span>., the article used once, and thus embracing the two parts of the one province (sometimes three parts are enumerated, Phœnicia being distinguished from Syria). There is apparently no example of the expression <span class="ital">Prov. Syria et Cilicia</span>, but Ramsay points to the analogy of Bithynia-Pontus; see <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, p. 29 ff., 1898, and “Cilicia” and “Bithynia” (Ramsay) in Hastings’ B.D. Ramsay therefore concludes that <a href="/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a> simply implies that Paul spent the following period of his life in various parts of the province Syria-Cilicia.—<span class="greekheb">Ταρσόν</span>, see above, <a href="/acts/9-11.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,">Acts 9:11</a>; on the years of quiet work at Tarsus and in its neighbourhood, see Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, pp. 46, 47, and below on <a href="/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:">Acts 11:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[232] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">Which when the brethren knew</span>] Lit. “And when the brethren knew it.” The disciples were informed as those of Damascus had been of the plot in that city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they brought him down to Cesarea</span>] i.e. to the seaport so called, not to Cæsarea Philippi, for the latter place was only touched by the road which led from Tyre to Damascus.

St. Paul gives another reason for his hasty departure from Jerusalem in his speech from the castle stairs (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17-21</a>).

There is no reasonable doubt that it means the same place here. A seaport, near to Jerusalem, and with Roman protection, affording access to Tarsus either by sea or land as should seem best, was the natural place for Paul's friends to take him to. If further proof were wanting, it could be found in the phrase, "brought him down," as compared with the converse, "gone up" (<a href="/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>), "ascended "(<a href="/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a>), when the journey was from Caesarea to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">To Tarsus</span>. A glance at the map will show that, starting from Caesarea, a person might either go by land along the sea-coast of Phoenicia, through Acre, Tyre, Sidon, Beyrout, Tripolis, Antioch, Issus, to Tarsus; or by sea to any of the intermediate ports between Caesarea and Tarsus; or rather the artificial harbor at the mouth of the Cydnus which formed the seaport of Tarsus. It is not improbable that Paul landed at Selcucia, since he says (<a href="/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>) that he came at this time "into the regions of Syria and Cilicia," which is exactly what he would have done if he had landed at Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch. </body></html>
