With characters of a lower type, the prospect of what they will have to suffer in any enterprise tends to deter them from embarking on it. With such a one as Saul of Tarsus, now repenting of the sufferings he had inflicted on others, that prospect would be welcome as enabling him, so far as that was possible, if not to atone for the past, at least to manifest fruits worthy of his repentance.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:10-22 A good work was begun in Saul, when he was brought to Christ's feet with those words, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And never did Christ leave any who were brought to that. Behold, the proud Pharisee, the unmerciful oppressor, the daring blasphemer, prayeth! And thus it is even now, and with the proud infidel, or the abandoned sinner. What happy tidings are these to all who understand the nature and power of prayer, of such prayer as the humbled sinner presents for the blessings of free salvation! Now he began to pray after another manner than he had done; before, he said his prayers, now, he prayed them. Regenerating grace sets people on praying; you may as well find a living man without breath, as a living Christian without prayer. Yet even eminent disciples, like Ananias, sometimes stagger at the commands of the Lord. But it is the Lord's glory to surpass our scanty expectations, and show that those are vessels of his mercy whom we are apt to consider as objects of his vengeance. The teaching of the Holy Spirit takes away the scales of ignorance and pride from the understanding; then the sinner becomes a new creature, and endeavours to recommend the anointed Saviour, the Son of God, to his former companions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I will show him ... - This seems to be added to encourage Ananias. He had feared Saul. The Lord now informs him that Saul, hitherto his enemy, would ever after be his friend. He would not merely profess repentance, but would manifest the sincerity of it by encountering trials and reproaches for his sake. The prediction here was fully accomplished, <a href="/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11-12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.
