but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker. Christians who have not property to give in charity, may yet be able to do acts of charity, working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the good of others. Those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them, whether the words of others do so or not. But such are ungrateful indeed, who have kindness shown them, and will not acknowledge it, by showing the kindness that is done them. While we live upon the fulness of Christ for our whole salvation, we should desire to be full of good works, for the honour of his name, and for the benefit of his saints. Such characters as Dorcas are useful where they dwell, as showing the excellency of the word of truth by their lives. How mean then the cares of the numerous females who seek no distinction but outward decoration, and who waste their lives in the trifling pursuits of dress and vanity! Power went along with the word, and Dorcas came to life. Thus in the raising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is the opening of the eyes of the mind. Here we see that the Lord can make up every loss; that he overrules every event for the good of those who trust in him, and for the glory of his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was neigh to Joppa - See the notes on <a href="/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32</a>.<p>They sent unto him ... - Why they sent is not affirmed.

It is certainly possible that they expected he would restore her to life; but as this is not mentioned; as the apostles had as yet raised up no one from the dead; as even Stephen had not been restored to life, we have no authority for assuming, or supposing, that they had formed any such expectation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. the disciples sent unto Peter&#8212;showing that the disciples generally did not possess miraculous gifts [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They sent for Peter, that he might come to comfort those that were concerned in the great loss of so good a woman, and, it may be, not without some hopes of her recovery by a miracle from St. Peter; which is the likelier, because they so much hasten his coming to them, she being already dead, and they preparing for her burial. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa,....
