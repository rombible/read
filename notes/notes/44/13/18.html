The word is found in the Greek of <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a> (“bare thee, as a man <span class= "ital">doth bear</span> his son”), where also some MSS. give the other word, and suggests the inference, already mentioned, that this chapter, as well as Isaiah 1, had been read as one of the lessons for the day.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:14-31 When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And about the time of forty years - They were this time going from Egypt to the land of Canaan. <a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-38.htm">Numbers 33:38</a>.<p>Suffered he their manners - This passage has been very variously rendered. See the margin. Syriac, "He nourished them," etc. Arabic, "He blessed them, and nourished them," etc. The Greek word is not elsewhere used in the New Testament. It properly means to tolerate, or endure the conduct of anyone, implying that that conduct is evil, and tends to provoke to punishment. This is doubtless its meaning here. Probably Paul referred to the passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, "The Lord thy God bare thee." But instead of this word, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  etropophore&#772;sen to bear with, many mss. read &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  etrofofore&#772;sen), "he sustained or nourished." This reading was followed by the Syriac, Arabic, and has been admitted by Griesbach into the text. This is also found in the Septuagint, in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, which place Paul doubtless referred to. This would well suit the connection of the passage; and a change of a single letter might easily have occurred in a ms. It adds to the probability that this is the true reading, that it accords with <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>. It is furthermore not probable that Paul would have commenced a discourse by reminding them of the obstinacy and wickedness of the nation. Such a course would rather tend to exasperate than to conciliate; but by reminding them of the mercies of God to them, and showing them that He had been their protector, he was better fitting them for his main purpose - that of showing them the kindness of the God of their fathers in sending to them a Saviour.<p>In the wilderness - The desert through which they passed in going from Egypt to Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-22. forty years suffered he their manners&#8212;rather, according to what appears the true reading, "cherished he them" (as a nurse the infant in her bosom).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is recorded, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/95-10.htm" title="Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:">Psalm 95:10</a></span>, and remembered by the apostle, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm" title="Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:">Hebrews 3:8</a>,9</span>, and to be admired through all ages, that God should be so patient, or a people could be so perverse.

The LXX. has rendered this <span class="greekheb">נשׂא</span> by <span class="greekheb">ἐτροφοφ</span>., whence it is evident, as the image is borrowed from a man, that it is based on the derivation from <span class="greekheb">ὁ τροφός</span> and not from <span class="greekheb">ἡ τροφός</span>. So also Cyril, in Oseam, p. 182, in Deut. p. 415.

Hom. 46. 3 (where of a mother it is said: <span class="greekheb">ἀναλαμβάνει καὶ περιθάλπει καὶ τροφοφορεῖ ἐν πολλῇ στοργῇ</span>). But as in this place and in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a> the notion of a male <span class="greekheb">τροφός</span> is quite as definitely presented (comp. Plat. Polit. p. 268 A B, Eur. Herc. f. 45, El. 409; usually <span class="greekheb">τροφεύς</span>, see Lobeck, ad Phryn. p. 316), it follows that the two references, the male and the female, are linguistically justified in an equal degree; therefore Hesychius explains <span class="greekheb">ἐτροφοφόρησεν</span>, entirely apart from sex, by <span class="greekheb">ἔθρεψεν</span>. From misapprehension of this, the word <span class="greekheb">ἐτροποφ</span>. was at an early period (among the Fathers, Origen already has it) introduced in Deut. l.c.; he bore their manners (Cic. ad Att. xiii. 29, Constitutt. ap. vii. 36, Schol. Arist. Ran. 1432), because the comparison of God to a nourishing mother or nurse, <span class="greekheb">ἡ τροφός</span>, was regarded as unsuitable,[10] and following this reading in Deut. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐτροποφ</span>. was also adopted in our passage for the same reason.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔθνη ἑπτά</span>] see <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>.

And moreover these two chapters, Deuteronomy 1 and Isaiah 1, are to the present day read on the one Sabbath: whence it is established with sufficient certainty that both were read on that very Sabbath, and that too in Greek, and that Paul referred especially to that reading of Moses and of the prophets spoken of in <a href="/acts/13-15.htm" title="And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.">Acts 13:15</a>.

[It was also at that time the same part of the year in which the temple, along with the city, both had been formerly desolated by the Chaldeans, and was subsequently to be desolated by the Romans.—V. g.] Now, as relates to the verb <span class="greekheb">ἐτροποφόρησεν</span>, instead of which valuable MSS. have <span class="greekheb">ἐτροφοφόρησεν</span>, it is already put beyond dispute that the passage referred to in it is <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ ἐτροφοφόρησέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς εἴ τις τροφοφορήσαι ἄνθρωπος τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ</span>. The Hebrew <span class="greekheb">נשא</span>, bore, expresses the simple notion: how did he bear with them? In endurance (tolerance) or in beneficence (kindness)? Answer: God bore, not merely led, the people of Israel in the wilderness, in a way most beneficent and altogether peculiar, such as would properly suit (apply to) that tender age, in which the people did not bear its own self as an adult man, but God bore it as a little child not yet able to help itself, so as that they were exempted from all anxiety concerning food, concerning raiment, and concerning their goings forth. Accordingly Scripture, in speaking of the people in the wilderness, distinguishes this peculiar way of their being borne from everything else of the kind. See <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm" title="And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-5.htm" title="You shall also consider in your heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm" title="Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm" title="He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>, etc.; <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>, at the end; <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/amos/2-10.htm" title="Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.">Amos 2:10</a>; Nehem. <a href="/acts/9-21.htm" title="But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came here for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?">Acts 9:21</a>, in which passage the conjugate <span class="greekheb">διέθρεψας</span> also comp. <a href="/numbers/11-12.htm" title="Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?">Numbers 11:12</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὡσεὶ ἄραι τιθηνὸς τὸν θηλάζοντα</span>. And it is to this that the passage also in Deuteronomy 1 has reference, and Paul here: whence Laud. 3, along with Æth. Arab. and Syr.[72] versions, has rendered the word <span class="ital">nourished</span>. For God <span class="ital">bore with the manners</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐτροποφόρησε</span>) of the people even previously, <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm" title="But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 20:9</a>, when <span class="ital">bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt</span>; and afterwards, <a href="/context/psalms/106-43.htm" title="Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity....">Psalm 106:43-44</a>, “Many times did He deliver them, but they provoked Him with their counsel.” Wherefore if <span class="greekheb">τροποφορεῖν</span> always had a different meaning from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΦΟΦΟΡΕῖΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἘΤΡΟΦΟΦΌΡΗΣΕ</span></span></span> should be by all means read; a verb which occurs also in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-27.htm" title="But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.">2Ma 7:27</a>, and in Macar. homil. 46, § 3. But <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΤΡΟΠΟΦΌΡΗΣΕΝ</span></span></span> is used in the same sense. For this verb has a double force, according as it is derived from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΌΠΟς</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΦῸς</span></span></span> (not from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΟΦῊ</span></span></span>): for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Φ</span></span></span> before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Φ</span></span></span> passes into <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Π</span></span></span>, as in writing the forms used are, not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΦῊ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΘΑΦῊ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἘΧΕΧΕΙΡΊΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὈΧΕΘΗΓΊΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΦΈΦΥΚΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΧΙΘῺΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἝΧΩ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΜΦΈΧΩ</span></span></span> (from which however come <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΞΕ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΜΦΈΞΩ</span></span></span>), but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦῊ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤΑΦῊ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἘΚΕΧΕΙΡΊΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὈΧΕΤΗΓΊΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΈΦΥΚΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΚΙΘῺΝ</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΙΤῺΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἜΧΩ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΜΠΈΧΩ</span></span></span>, from a wish to avoid aspirates, a feeling which goes so far that the transcribers wrote everywhere, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΦΑΡΙΣΑῖΟΙ</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑἹ ἩΜΈΡΑΙ</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἾς Ὁ</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> The Scholiast on Aristophanes employs it in the sense derived from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΌΠΟς</span></span></span>: commenting on the verses,—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] <span class="ital">Syr.</span> the Peschito Syriac Version: second cent.: publ. and corrected by Cureton, from MS. of fifth cent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Οὐ χρὴ λέοντος σκύμνον ἐκ πόλει τρέφειν</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Μάλιστα μὲν λέοντα μὴ ʼν πόλει τρέφειν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἤν δʼ ἐκτραφῇ τίς</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῖς τρόποις ὑπηρετεῖν</span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ranæ, Acts 5, Scene 4, 185 f.—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>he renders the last phrase by the verb <span class="greekheb">τροποφορεῖν</span>. Also Tully, l. 13, ad Att. Epist. 29, <span class="greekheb">τὸν τύφον μου τροποφόρησον</span>. But in Scripture, even those who write <span class="greekheb">τροποφορεῖν</span>, nevertheless mean <span class="greekheb">τροφοφορεῖν</span>. The Cod. Cantabrigiensis has in the Greek <span class="greekheb">ἐτροποφόρησεν</span>, and yet in the Latin, “ac si nutrix aluit.” The Apost. Constit. have <span class="greekheb">ἐτροποφόρησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν παντοίοις ἀγαθοῖς</span>, I. vii. c. 36. And so clearly Ephraim Syrus, <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ νήπιον</span>,—<span class="greekheb">οὕτω καὶ αἱ ψυχαὶ αἱ χάριτος θείας μέτοχοι γενόμεναι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τροποφοροῦνται ἐν τῇ γλυκύτητι καὶ ἀναπαύσει τοῦ πνεύματος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., fol. <span class="greekheb">υκς</span>. ed. Oxon. On the contrary, <span class="greekheb">τροποφορεῖν</span> from <span class="greekheb">τρόπος</span>, at least in the testimonies just quoted, implies some degree of consent (approval): but God by no means approved of the manners of the people in the wilderness. He says <span class="greekheb">προσώχθισα</span>, <span class="ital">I was grieved</span>, <a href="/hebrews/3-10.htm" title="Why I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.">Hebrews 3:10</a>; with which comp. <a href="/exodus/23-21.htm" title="Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.">Exodus 23:21</a>, “Provoke Him not, for He will not pardon your transgressions;” <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm" title="Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.">Exodus 32:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-23.htm" title="Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.">Psalm 106:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm" title="But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.">Isaiah 63:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-13.htm" title="But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them.">Ezekiel 20:13</a>. Then, even though it may be understood of an unobjectionable <span class="ital">toleration</span> of bad <span class="ital">manners</span>, yet in this passage, as Mill says, “perhaps it is not even true. For how can it be said that God bore their manners for forty years in the wilderness, seeing that He destroyed them all, excepting one and a second (Joshua and Caleb), in the wilderness?” Nor would that notion accord with the design of the apostle: for he would thus, by implication, be accusing the Israelites; which it is not probable that he wished to do immediately at the beginning of his address, especially as that beginning was so mild a one. Procopius Gazæus joins <span class="greekheb">τρέπω</span> and <span class="greekheb">τρέφω</span> in the derivation of this verb, explaining that <span class="greekheb">ἐτροποφόρησεν</span>, Deuteronomy 1, <span class="greekheb">ὁ σύμμαχος ἐβάστασε</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησί</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κυρίως δὲ σημαίνει τὸ τοὺς παῖδας δυσκολαίνοντας τρέπειν καὶ μεταφέρειν διὰ συμψελλισμῶν καὶ συγκαταβάσεως</span>. See Hoeschel on Orig. c. Cels., p. 480. At all events, whatever of good the notion has in it from the term <span class="greekheb">τρόπος</span>, still remains: for evidently a <span class="greekheb">τροφὸς</span>, <span class="ital">nurse</span>, also performs as well the other offices of kindness, as also especially tolerates patiently the manners (temper and ways) of a peevish little child: and God tolerated the manners of the Israelites, but He also, in many other ways, <span class="greekheb">ἐτροφοφορησε</span>: see the whole of Psalms 78. Comp. App. Crit. Ed. ii. on this passage.[73] We must say something also of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΕΚΛΗΡΟΝΟΜΗΣΕΝ</span></span></span>. It denotes not merely, <span class="ital">to take an inheritance</span>, but also <span class="ital">to give an inheritance</span>; <a href="/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.">Jdg 11:24</a>, “That which Chemosh shall <span class="ital">give</span> thee <span class="ital">to possess</span>,” <span class="greekheb">κληρονομήσει</span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΛΗΡΟΝΟΜΉΣΟΜΕΝ</span></span></span>, “we will <span class="ital">possess</span> as an inheritance.” And in this passage of Luke it rests on the best MSS. A very few have <span class="greekheb">κατεκληροδότησεν</span>.[74] The same variety of reading is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm" title="But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>, LXX.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ΤΕΣΣΑΡΑΚΟΝΤΑΕΤῆ ΧΡΌΝΟΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">about the space of four hundred years</span>) Paul, in recounting the benefits of GOD towards the people in chronological method, at the same time furnishes to his hearers occasion (handle) for thinking about the length of the ages from the Exodus down to Christ, and invites his hearers on that account the rather to acknowledge that Jesus is the Christ.
