It was the ever-recurring burden of the glad tidings which were preached alike by all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/acts/13.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE FIRST PREACHING IN ASIA MINOR<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a> - <a href="/acts/13-39.htm" title="And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.">Acts 13:39</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The extended report of Paul’s sermon in the synagogue at Antioch of Pisidia marks it, in accordance with Luke’s method, as the first of a series. It was so because, though the composition of the audience was identical with that of those in the synagogues of Cyprus, this was the beginning of the special work of the tour, the preaching in the cities of Asia Minor. The part of the address contained in the passage falls into three sections,-the condensed narrative of the Gospel facts {<a href="/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a> - <a href="/acts/13-31.htm" title="And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.">Acts 13:31</a>}, the proof that the resurrection was prophesied {<a href="/acts/13-32.htm" title="And we declare to you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made to the fathers,">Acts 13:32</a> - <a href="/acts/13-37.htm" title="But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.">Acts 13:37</a>}, and the pungent personal application {<a href="/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:">Acts 13:38</a> - <a href="/acts/13-52.htm" title="And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 13:52</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The substance of the narrative coincides, as it could not but do, with Peter’s sermons, but yet with differences, partly due to the different audience, partly to Paul’s idiosyncrasy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>After the preceding historical <span class="ital">resume</span>, he girds himself to his proper work of proclaiming the Gospel, and he marks the transition in <a href="/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a> by reiterating his introductory words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> His audience comprised the two familiar classes of Jews and Gentile proselytes, and he seeks to win the ears of both. His heart goes out in his address to them all as ‘brethren,’ and in his classing himself and Barnabas among them as receivers of the message which he has to proclaim. What skill, if it were not something much more sacred, even humility and warm love, lies in that ‘to <span class="ital">us</span> is the word of this salvation sent’! He will not stand above them as if he had any other possession of his message than they might have. He, too, has received it, and what he is about to say is not his word, but God’s message to them and him. That is the way to preach.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Notice, too, how skilfully he introduces the narrative of the rejection of Jesus as the reason why the message has now come to them his hearers away in Antioch. It is ‘sent forth’ ‘to us,’ Asiatic Jews, <span class="ital">for</span> the people in the sacred city would not have it. Paul does not prick his hearers’ consciences, as Peter did, by charging home the guilt of the rejection of Jesus on them. They had no share in that initial crime. There is a faint purpose of dissociating himself and his hearers from the people of Jerusalem, to whom the Dispersion were accustomed to look up, in the designation, ‘they that dwell in Jerusalem, and <span class="ital">their</span> rulers.’ Thus far the Antioch Jews had had hands clean from that crime; they had now to choose whether they would mix themselves up with it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We may further note that Paul says nothing about Christ’s life of gentle goodness, His miracles or teaching, but concentrates attention on His death and resurrection. From the beginning of his ministry these were the main elements of his ‘Gospel’ {<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a> - <a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm" title="And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>}. The full significance of that death is not declared here. Probably it was reserved for subsequent instruction. But it and the Resurrection, which interpreted it, are set in the forefront, as they should always be. The main point insisted on is that the men of Jerusalem were fulfilling prophecy in slaying Jesus. With tragic deafness, they knew not the voices of the prophets, clear and unanimous as they were, though they heard them every Sabbath of their lives, and yet they fulfilled them. A prophet’s words had just been read in the synagogue; Paul’s words might set some hearer asking whether a veil had been over his heart while his ears had heard the sound of the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Resurrection is established by the only evidence for a historical fact, the testimony of competent eyewitnesses. Their competence is established by their familiar companionship with Jesus during His whole career; their opportunities for testing the reality of the fact, by the ‘many days’ of His appearances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Paul does not put forward his own testimony to the Resurrection, though we know, from <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>, that he regarded Christ’s appearance to him as being equally valid evidence with that afforded by the other appearances; but he distinguishes between the work of the Apostles, as ‘witnesses unto the people’-that is, the Jews of Palestine-and that of Barnabas and himself. They had to bear the message to the regions beyond. The Apostles and he had the same work, but different spheres.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The second part turns with more personal address to his hearers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Its purport is not so much to preach the Resurrection, which could only be proved by testimony, as to establish the fact that it was the fulfilment of the promises to the fathers. Note how the idea of fulfilled prophecy runs in Paul’s head. The Jews had <span class="ital">fulfilled</span> it by their crime; God <span class="ital">fulfilled</span> it by the Resurrection. This reiteration of a key-word is a mark of Paul’s style in his Epistles, and its appearance here attests the accuracy of the report of his speech.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second Psalm, from which Paul’s first quotation is made, is prophetic of Christ, inasmuch as it represents in vivid lyrical language the vain rebellion of earthly rulers against Messiah, and Jehovah’s establishing Him and His kingdom by a steadfast decree. Peter quoted its picture of the rebels, as fulfilled in the coalition of Herod, Pilate, and the Jewish rulers against Christ. The Messianic reference of the Psalm, then, was already seen; and we may not be going too far if we assume that Jesus Himself had included it among things written in the Psalms ‘concerning Himself,’ which He had explained to the disciples after the Resurrection. It depicts Jehovah speaking to Messiah, <span class="ital">after</span> the futile attempts of the rebels: ‘This day have I begotten Thee.’ That day is a definite point in time. The Resurrection was a birth from the dead; so Paul, in <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>, calls Jesus ‘the first begotten from the dead.’ <a href="/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>,’declared to be the Son of God . . . by the resurrection from the dead,’ is the best commentary on Paul’s words here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second and third quotations must apparently be combined, for the second does not specifically refer to resurrection, but it promises to ‘you,’ that is to those who obey the call to partake in the Messianic blessings, a share in the ‘sure’ and enduring ‘mercies of David’; and the third quotation shows that not ‘to see corruption’ was one of these ‘mercies.’ That implies that the speaker in the Psalm was, in Paul’s view, David, and that his words were his believing answer to a divine promise. But David was dead. Had the ‘sure mercy’ proved, then, a broken reed? Not so: for Jesus, who is Messiah, and is God’s ‘Holy One’ in a deeper sense than David was, has not seen corruption. The Psalmist’s hopes are fulfilled in Him, and through Him, in all who will ‘eat’ that their ‘souls may live,’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. But Paul’s yearning for his brethren’s salvation is not content with proclaiming the fact of Christ’s resurrection, nor with pointing to it as fulfilling prophecy; he gathers all up into a loving, urgent offer of salvation for every believing soul, and solemn warning to despisers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Here the whole man flames out. Here the characteristic evangelical teaching, which is sometimes ticketed as ‘Pauline’ by way of stigma, is heard. Already had he grasped the great antithesis between Law and Gospel. Already his great word ‘justified’ has taken its place in his terminology. The essence of the Epistles to Romans and Galatians is here. Justification is the being pronounced and treated as not guilty. Law cannot justify. ‘In Him’ we are justified. Observe that this is an advance on the previous statement that ‘through Him’ we receive remission of sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘In Him’ points, thought but incidentally and slightly, to the great truth of incorporation with Jesus, of which Paul had afterwards so much to write. The justifying in Christ is complete and absolute. And the sole sufficient condition of receiving it is faith. But the greater the glory of the light the darker the shadow which it casts. The broad offer of complete salvation has ever to be accompanied with the plain warning of the dread issue of rejecting it. Just because it is so free and full, and to be had on such terms, the warning has to be rung into deaf ears, ‘Beware <span class="ital">therefore</span>!’ Hope and fear are legitimately appealed to by the Christian evangelist. They are like the two wings which may lift the soul to soar to its safe shelter in the Rock of Ages.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:...">Acts 13:38-39</a>. </span><span class="ital">Be it known unto you, therefore </span>— Be persuaded of this as a most certain and momentous truth, a truth infinitely consolatory; <span class="ital">that through this man </span>— This seed of David, and <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God; is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins </span>— The free, full, and assured pardon of all your offences, be they ever so great, and ever so aggravated. <span class="ital">And by him </span>— By his mediation, by his sacrifice and intercession; <span class="ital">all that believe </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">πας ο πιστευων</span>, <span class="ital">every one that believeth; </span>namely, in him as the Messiah promised of old, the Saviour of the world, able and willing <span class="ital">to save to the uttermost all that come unto God through him; </span>every one that relies entirely on him for salvation, present and eternal, and receives him in all his offices and characters, (of which see the note on <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>,) every one whose faith in him, and in the declarations and promises of his gospel, <span class="ital">worketh by love, </span><a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>; <span class="ital">is justified from all things </span>— Has the actual forgiveness of all his sins, and is accounted righteous by and before God at the very time of his believing.

See <a href="/context/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect....">Hebrews 10:1-12</a>. The Mosaic “law appointed sin-offerings to expiate smaller offences, so far as the offender who offered them should be free from all further prosecution on account of them. But this very view of them shows how absolutely necessary to the being of society it was, that they should not be admitted in cases of murder, adultery, &c. These crimes, therefore, were made capital; nor was the dying criminal, however penitent, allowed to offer them, which would have been quite inconsistent with the temporal pardon connected with them. But the expiatory sacrifice of Christ takes away the guilt of all sin,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>with respect to the penitent that believe aright on him; “and though it by no means affects the manner in which offenders may stand in human courts, (which the Mosaic sacrifices did,) it delivers from the condemnation of God in the invisible world; with respect to which, those of the Mosaic law could have no efficacy at all,” except so far as penitent offenders, considering these sacrifices as typifying that of Christ, were brought, through them, to have a believing dependance on him and his sacrifice.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:38-41 Let all that hear the gospel of Christ, know these two things: 1. That through this Man, who died and rose again, is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins. Your sins, though many and great, may be forgiven, and they may be so without any injury to God's honour. 2. It is by Christ only that those who believe in him, and none else, are justified from all things; from all the guilt and stain of sin, from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses. The great concern of convinced sinners is, to be justified, to be acquitted from all their guilt, and accepted as righteous in God's sight, for if any is left charged upon the sinner, he is undone. By Jesus Christ we obtain a complete justification; for by him a complete atonement was made for sin. We are justified, not only by him as our Judge but by him as the Lord our Righteousness. What the law could not do for us, in that it was weak, the gospel of Christ does. This is the most needful blessing, bringing in every other. The threatenings are warnings; what we are told will come upon impenitent sinners, is designed to awaken us to beware lest it come upon us. It ruins many, that they despise religion.

The apostle having discoursed concerning the incarnation of Christ, his death and resurrection, proceeds to take notice of some particular benefits and blessings of grace arising from thence, which are published and made known to the sons of men in the everlasting Gospel, as were now to the Jews by Paul and Barnabas; such as forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ, and justification by his righteousness; the former of them is mentioned in this verse, the latter in the next: <p>that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; forgiveness of sins, which is sometimes expressed by a non-imputation of them, a non-remembrance of them, a covering and putting them away, and a blotting them out, is an act of free grace and mercy, and yet is through the blood of Christ; through that believers have it; Christ is exalted as a Prince and a Saviour to give it, having by his blood procured it; and this is a principal doctrine of the Gospel, which is published in his name, and which the light of nature and law of Moses know nothing of, and cannot ascertain; the prophets bear testimony to this truth, that everyone that believes in Christ shall receive the remission of sins, of all his sins. That there is a God is known by the light of nature, and that sin is an offence unto him; but by it is not known in what way offended Deity is appeased; nor does it, nor can it assure any that God will forgive sin on any account whatever; not on account of mercy in him, nor on account of good works, or of repentance in them; God, as the God of nature, does not forgive sin, but as the God of grace: and though the law of Moses declares what is good, and gives knowledge of evil, yet admits not of repentance as a satisfaction for sin committed; nor does it represent God as merciful, but as just, and so accuses, condemns, and kills: the doctrine of forgiveness is a pure doctrine of the Gospel; and when it is preached aright, it is preached through Christ, not through the works of the law, not through repentance, nor through faith, nor through the absolute mercy of God, but through Christ, through the blood of Christ, which was shed to obtain it in a way consistent with the justice of God; and through his hands it is given. When Christ is called a "man", it must not be thought that he is a mere man; he is God as well as man; had he been a mere man, forgiveness of sin could not have been by his blood, or through his name, or for his sake; it is because he is God, truly and properly God, that there is a virtue in his blood to take away sin, and cleanse from it; see <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a> Besides, the word "man" is not in the original text, it is only "through this is preached to you"; that is, through this glorious and divine person, who, though he died as man, and was buried, yet saw no corruption, and is now raised from the dead, and is at the right hand of God. Some copies read , because of this, or for this reason; seeing he is raised from the dead, therefore the doctrine of the remission of sins is preached; for if he had died, and had not risen again, there could have been no pardon by his blood, nor justification by his righteousness; see <a href="/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{15}</span> Be it known unto you therefore, men <i>and</i> brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</span><p>(15) Christ was sent to give them free remission of sins who were condemned by the Law.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:...">Acts 13:38-39</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τούτου</span>] <span class="ital">through this one</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">through His being announced to you</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων</span> … <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦται</span>] <span class="ital">and that from all things, from which</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὧν</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ὧν</span>, see on <a href="/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a>) <span class="ital">ye were unable to be justified in the law of Moses, every one who believes in this One is justified</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ πάντων</span>] is pregnant: <span class="ital">justified</span> and accordingly freed (in respect of the bond of guilt) <span class="ital">from all things</span>. <a href="/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/26-29.htm" title="A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin.">Sir 26:29</a>; <span class="ital">Test.

But the proposition that one becomes justified in Christ by means of faith from all things (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> from all sins; comp. before <span class="greekheb">ἄφεσις ἁμαρτιῶν</span>), from which one cannot obtain justification in the law, is not meant to affirm that already in the law there is given a partial attainment of justification and the remainder is attained in Christ (Schwegler, <span class="ital">nachapost. Zeitalt.</span> II. p. 96 f.; admitted also by Zeller, p. 299), which would be un-Pauline and contrary to the whole of the N.T. On the contrary, Paul, when laying down that proposition in itself entirely correct, leaves the circumstance, that man finds in the law justification from <span class="ital">no kind</span> of sins, still entirely out of account, with great prudence not adopting at once an antinomistic attitude, but reserving the particulars of the doctrine of justification in its relation to the law for eventually further Christian instruction. The proposition is of a general, theoretic nature; it is only the <span class="ital">major proposition</span> of the doctrine of justification (from all things from which a man is not justified <span class="ital">in the law</span>, he is justified <span class="ital">in Christ</span> by faith); the <span class="ital">minor proposition</span> (but in the law a man can be justified from <span class="ital">nothing</span>) and the <span class="ital">conclusion</span> (therefore only in Christ can <span class="ital">all</span> justification be obtained) are still kept back and reserved for further development. Therefore the shift of Neander, I. p. 145, is entirely unnecessary, who (comp. also Schneckenburger, p. 131, and Lekebusch, p. 334) very arbitrarily assumes that <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span> is designed to denote only the <span class="ital">completeness</span> of the removal of guilt, and that, properly speaking, Paul has had it in view to refer the relative to the whole idea of <span class="greekheb">δικαιωθῆναι</span>, but by a kind of logical attraction has referred it to <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may add that <span class="ital">the</span> view (Wolf and others, following the Vulgate), according to which <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦται</span> is taken as an independent proposition (as it is also by Lachmann, who has erased <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, after A C* <span class="greekheb">א</span>), is also admissible, although less in keeping with the flow of the discourse, which connects the negative element (<span class="greekheb">ἄφεσις ἁμαρτ</span>.) and the positive correlative to it (<span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦται</span>) with one another; therefore <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is the simple and, not: and indeed. But it is contrary to the construction to attach <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπὸ</span> … <span class="greekheb">δικαιωθῆναι</span> to the preceding; so Luther, also Bornemann, who, however, with D, inserts <span class="greekheb">μετάνοια</span> after <span class="greekheb">καί</span>. Lastly, that neither, with Luther, is <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> to be connected with <span class="greekheb">πιστεύων</span>, nor, with Morus, is <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ πᾶς ὁ πιστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦται</span> to be taken as a proposition by itself, is evident from the close reciprocal relation of <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ νόμῳ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the idea of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι</span>, the essence of which here already, by <span class="greekheb">πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων</span>, most definitely emerges as the Pauline justitia fidei, see on <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:...">Acts 13:38-41</a>.
