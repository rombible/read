The former were offered, as the fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham, the high privilege of being the channel through which “all families of the earth should be blessed” by the knowledge of Christ (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>). When they rejected that offer, it was made, without their intervention, to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">Judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.</span>—There is a touch of righteous indignation, perhaps something like irony, in the words. The preacher had thought them “worthy” of the highest of all blessings, the life eternal which was in Christ Jesus, but they, in their boastful and envious pride, took what was really a lower estimate of themselves, and showed that they were “unworthy.” They passed sentence, <span class= "ital">ipso facto, </span>on themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</span>—We have to remember (1) that the words were as an echo of those which the Apostle had heard in his trance in the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a>); (2) that they would be heard, on the one hand, by the Gentiles with a joy hitherto unknown, and, on the other, by the Jews as a new cause of irritation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/acts/13.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>JEWISH REJECTERS AND GENTILE RECEIVERS<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">UNWORTHY OF LIFE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So ended the first attempt on Paul’s great missionary journey to preach to the Jews. It is described at great length and the sermon given in full because it is the first. A wonderful sermon it was; touching all keys of feeling, now pleading almost with tears, now flashing with indignation, now calmly dealing with Scripture prophecies, now glowing as it tells the story of Christ’s death for men. It melted some of the hearers, but the most were wrought up to furious passion-and with characteristic vehemence, like their ancestors and their descendants through long dreary generations, fell to ‘contradicting and blaspheming.’ We can see the scene in the synagogue, the eager faces, the vehement gestures, the hubbub of tongues, the bitter words that stormed round the two in the midst, Barnabas like Jupiter, grave, majestic, and venerable; Paul like Mercury, agile, mobile, swift of speech. They bore the brunt of the fury till they saw it to be hopeless to try to calm it, and then departed with these remarkable words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They are even more striking if we notice that ‘judge’ here may be used in its full legal sense. It is not merely equivalent to <span class="ital">consider</span>, for these Jews by no means thought themselves unworthy of eternal life, but it means, ‘ye adjudge and pass sentence on yourselves to be.’ Their rejection of the message was a self-pronounced sentence. It proved them to be, and made them, ‘unworthy of eternal life.’ There are two or three very striking thoughts to be gathered from these words which I would dwell on now.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. What constitutes worthiness and unworthiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>There are two meanings to the word ‘worthy’-deserving or fit. They run into each other and yet they may be kept quite apart. For instance you may say of a man that ‘he is worthy’ to be something or other, for which he is obviously qualified, not thinking at all whether he deserves it or not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now in the first of these senses-we are all unworthy of eternal life. That is just to state in other words the tragic truth of universal sinfulness. The natural outcome and issue of the course which all men follow is death. But yet there are men who are fit for and capable of eternal life. Who they are and what fitness is can only be ascertained when we rightly understand what eternal life is. It is not merely future blessedness or a synonym for a vulgar heaven. That is the common notion of its meaning. Men think of that future as a blessed state to which God can admit anybody if He will, and, as He is good, will admit pretty nearly everybody. But eternal life is a present possession as well as a future one, and passing by its deeper aspects, it includes-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Deliverance from evil habits and desires.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Purity, and love of all good and fair things.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Communion with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As well as forgiveness and removal of punishment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What then are the qualifications making a man worthy of, in the sense of fit for, such a state?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">a</span>} To know oneself to be unworthy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He who judges himself to be worthy is unworthy. He who knows himself to be unworthy is worthy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The first requisite is consciousness of sin, leading to repentance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">b</span>} To abandon striving to make oneself worthy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> By ourselves we never can do so. Many of us think that we must do our best, and then God will do the rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There must be the entire cessation of all attempt to work out by our own efforts characters that would entitle us to eternal life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">c</span>} To be willing to accept life on God’s terms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> As a mere gift.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">d</span>} To desire it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God cannot give it to any one who does not want it. He cannot force His gifts on us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This then is the worthiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. How we pass sentence on ourselves as unworthy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is quite clear that ‘judge’ here does not mean consider, for a sense of unworthiness is not the reason which keeps men away from the Gospel. Rather, as we have seen, a proud belief in our worthiness keeps very many away. But ‘judge’ here means ‘adjudicate’ or ‘pronounce sentence on,’ and worthy means fit, qualified.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Consider then-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">a</span>} That our attitude to the Gospel is a revelation of our deepest selves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Gospel is a ‘discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart.’ It judges us here and now, and by their attitude to it ‘the thoughts of many hearts shall be revealed.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">b</span>} That our rejection of it plainly shows that we have not the qualifications for eternal life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No doubt some men are kept from accepting Christ by intellectual doubts and difficulties, but even these would alter their whole attitude to Him if they had a profound consciousness of sin, and a desire for deliverance from it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But with regard to the great bulk of its hearers, no doubt the hindrance is chiefly moral. Many causes may combine to produce the absence of qualification. The excuses in the parable’-farm, oxen, wife’-all amount to engrossment with this present world, and such absorption in the things seen and temporal deadens desire. So the Gospel preached excites no longings, and a man hears the offer of salvation without one motion of his heart towards it, and thus proclaims himself ‘unworthy of eternal life.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the great disqualification is the absence of all consciousness of sin. This is the very deepest reason which keeps men away from Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How solemn a thing the preaching and hearing of this word is!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How possible for you to make yourselves fit!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How simple the qualification! We have but to know ourselves sinners and to trust Jesus and then we ‘shall be counted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead.’ Then we shall be ‘worthy to escape and to stand before the Son of Man.’ Then shall we be ‘worthy of this calling,’ and the Judge himself shall say: ‘They shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles....">Acts 13:46-47</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Paul and Barnabas </span>— Perceiving that no good impression could be made upon them; <span class="ital">waxed bold </span>— Used great freedom of speech; <span class="ital">and said, It was necessary </span>— According to the general instructions of our Divine Master; <span class="ital">that the word of God should first be spoken to you </span>— He shows that he had not preached to them from any confidence of their believing; <span class="ital">but seeing ye put it from you, and </span>— By that very action, in effect; <span class="ital">judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life </span>— Persons unfit to have it offered to you. This text plainly shows that persons may be said to be self-condemned, who furnish out matter of condemnation from their own words, though they do not actually pass sentence on themselves: for nothing was further from the thoughts of these Jews than to declare themselves unworthy of eternal life, because they did not believe the gospel; for they rather expected that life by rejecting it. They, indeed, judged none but themselves worthy of it; yet their conduct in rejecting the gospel, was the same as saying, We are unworthy of eternal life; as it effectually precluded their obtaining it. <span class="ital">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles </span>— Not that they intended entirely to desist from preaching to the Jews, for we find they continued to address them first in other places wherever they came; but they now determined to lose no more time at Antioch on their ungrateful countrymen, but to employ themselves wholly in doing what they could for the conversion of the Gentiles there. <span class="ital">For so hath the Lord commanded us </span>— See <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a>; in consequence of that prediction which was uttered by Isaiah in the name of God; <span class="ital">saying </span>— To his Son, the Messiah; <span class="ital">I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles, </span>&c.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:42-52 The Jews opposed the doctrine the apostles preached; and when they could find no objection, they blasphemed Christ and his gospel. Commonly those who begin with contradicting, end with blaspheming. But when adversaries of Christ's cause are daring, its advocates should be the bolder. And while many judge themselves unworthy of eternal life, others, who appear less likely, desire to hear more of the glad tidings of salvation. This is according to what was foretold in the Old Testament. What light, what power, what a treasure does this gospel bring with it! How excellent are its truths, its precepts, its promises! Those came to Christ whom the Father drew, and to whom the Spirit made the gospel call effectual, Ro 8:30. As many as were disposed to eternal life, as many as had concern about their eternal state, and aimed to make sure of eternal life, believed in Christ, in whom God has treasured up that life, and who is the only Way to it; and it was the grace of God that wrought it in them. It is good to see honourable women devout; the less they have to do in the world, the more they should do for their own souls, and the souls of others: but it is sad, when, under colour of devotion to God, they try to show hatred to Christ. And the more we relish the comforts and encouragements we meet with in the power of godliness, and the fuller our hearts are of them, the better prepared we are to face difficulties in the profession of godliness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Waxed bold - Became bold; spake boldly and openly. They were not terrified by their strife, or alarmed by their opposition. The contradictions and blasphemies of sinners often show that their consciences are alarmed; that the truth has taken effect; and then is not the time to shrink, but to declare more fearlessly the truth.<p>It was necessary - It was so designed; so commanded. They regarded it as their duty to offer the gospel first to their own countrymen. See the notes on <a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>.<p>Ye put it from you - You reject it.<p>And judge yourselves - By your conduct, by your rejecting it, you declare this. The word "judge" here does not mean they "expressed such an opinion," or that "they regarded themselves" as unworthy of eternal life - for they thought just the reverse; but that by their conduct they condemned themselves. By such conduct they did, in fact, pass sentence on themselves, and show that they were unworthy of eternal life, and of having the offer of salvation any further made to them. Sinners by their conduct do, in fact, condemn themselves, and show that they are not only unfit to be saved, but that they have advanced so far in wickedness that there is no hope of their salvation, and no propriety in offering them, any further, eternal life. See the notes on <a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>.<p>Unworthy ... - Unfit to be saved. They had deliberately and solemnly rejected the gospel, and thus shown that they were not suited to enter into everlasting life. We may remark here:<p>(1) When people, even but once, deliberately and solemnly reject the offers of God's mercy, it greatly endangers their salvation. The probability is, that they then put the cup of salvation forever away from themselves.<p>(2) the gospel produces an effect wherever it is preached.<p>(3) when sinners are hardened, and spurn the gospel, it may often be the duty of ministers to turn their efforts toward others where they may have more prospect of success. A man will not long labor on a rocky, batten, sterile soil, when there is near him a rich and fertile valley that will abundantly reward the pains of cultivation.<p>Lo, we turn ... - We shall offer the gospel to them, and devote ourselves to seeking their salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46.
