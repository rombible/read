It was so because, though the composition of the audience was identical with that of those in the synagogues of Cyprus, this was the beginning of the special work of the tour, the preaching in the cities of Asia Minor. The part of the address contained in the passage falls into three sections,-the condensed narrative of the Gospel facts {<a href="/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a> - <a href="/acts/13-31.htm" title="And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.">Acts 13:31</a>}, the proof that the resurrection was prophesied {<a href="/acts/13-32.htm" title="And we declare to you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made to the fathers,">Acts 13:32</a> - <a href="/acts/13-37.htm" title="But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.">Acts 13:37</a>}, and the pungent personal application {<a href="/acts/13-38.htm" title="Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:">Acts 13:38</a> - <a href="/acts/13-52.htm" title="And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 13:52</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The substance of the narrative coincides, as it could not but do, with Peter’s sermons, but yet with differences, partly due to the different audience, partly to Paul’s idiosyncrasy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>After the preceding historical <span class="ital">resume</span>, he girds himself to his proper work of proclaiming the Gospel, and he marks the transition in <a href="/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a> by reiterating his introductory words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> His audience comprised the two familiar classes of Jews and Gentile proselytes, and he seeks to win the ears of both. His heart goes out in his address to them all as ‘brethren,’ and in his classing himself and Barnabas among them as receivers of the message which he has to proclaim. What skill, if it were not something much more sacred, even humility and warm love, lies in that ‘to <span class="ital">us</span> is the word of this salvation sent’! He will not stand above them as if he had any other possession of his message than they might have. He, too, has received it, and what he is about to say is not his word, but God’s message to them and him. That is the way to preach.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Notice, too, how skilfully he introduces the narrative of the rejection of Jesus as the reason why the message has now come to them his hearers away in Antioch. It is ‘sent forth’ ‘to us,’ Asiatic Jews, <span class="ital">for</span> the people in the sacred city would not have it. Paul does not prick his hearers’ consciences, as Peter did, by charging home the guilt of the rejection of Jesus on them. They had no share in that initial crime. There is a faint purpose of dissociating himself and his hearers from the people of Jerusalem, to whom the Dispersion were accustomed to look up, in the designation, ‘they that dwell in Jerusalem, and <span class="ital">their</span> rulers.’ Thus far the Antioch Jews had had hands clean from that crime; they had now to choose whether they would mix themselves up with it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We may further note that Paul says nothing about Christ’s life of gentle goodness, His miracles or teaching, but concentrates attention on His death and resurrection. From the beginning of his ministry these were the main elements of his ‘Gospel’ {<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a> - <a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm" title="And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>}. The full significance of that death is not declared here. Probably it was reserved for subsequent instruction. But it and the Resurrection, which interpreted it, are set in the forefront, as they should always be. The main point insisted on is that the men of Jerusalem were fulfilling prophecy in slaying Jesus. With tragic deafness, they knew not the voices of the prophets, clear and unanimous as they were, though they heard them every Sabbath of their lives, and yet they fulfilled them. A prophet’s words had just been read in the synagogue; Paul’s words might set some hearer asking whether a veil had been over his heart while his ears had heard the sound of the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Resurrection is established by the only evidence for a historical fact, the testimony of competent eyewitnesses. Their competence is established by their familiar companionship with Jesus during His whole career; their opportunities for testing the reality of the fact, by the ‘many days’ of His appearances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Paul does not put forward his own testimony to the Resurrection, though we know, from <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>, that he regarded Christ’s appearance to him as being equally valid evidence with that afforded by the other appearances; but he distinguishes between the work of the Apostles, as ‘witnesses unto the people’-that is, the Jews of Palestine-and that of Barnabas and himself. They had to bear the message to the regions beyond. The Apostles and he had the same work, but different spheres.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The second part turns with more personal address to his hearers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Its purport is not so much to preach the Resurrection, which could only be proved by testimony, as to establish the fact that it was the fulfilment of the promises to the fathers. Note how the idea of fulfilled prophecy runs in Paul’s head. The Jews had <span class="ital">fulfilled</span> it by their crime; God <span class="ital">fulfilled</span> it by the Resurrection. This reiteration of a key-word is a mark of Paul’s style in his Epistles, and its appearance here attests the accuracy of the report of his speech.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second Psalm, from which Paul’s first quotation is made, is prophetic of Christ, inasmuch as it represents in vivid lyrical language the vain rebellion of earthly rulers against Messiah, and Jehovah’s establishing Him and His kingdom by a steadfast decree. Peter quoted its picture of the rebels, as fulfilled in the coalition of Herod, Pilate, and the Jewish rulers against Christ. The Messianic reference of the Psalm, then, was already seen; and we may not be going too far if we assume that Jesus Himself had included it among things written in the Psalms ‘concerning Himself,’ which He had explained to the disciples after the Resurrection. It depicts Jehovah speaking to Messiah, <span class="ital">after</span> the futile attempts of the rebels: ‘This day have I begotten Thee.’ That day is a definite point in time. The Resurrection was a birth from the dead; so Paul, in <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>, calls Jesus ‘the first begotten from the dead.’ <a href="/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>,’declared to be the Son of God . . . by the resurrection from the dead,’ is the best commentary on Paul’s words here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second and third quotations must apparently be combined, for the second does not specifically refer to resurrection, but it promises to ‘you,’ that is to those who obey the call to partake in the Messianic blessings, a share in the ‘sure’ and enduring ‘mercies of David’; and the third quotation shows that not ‘to see corruption’ was one of these ‘mercies.’ That implies that the speaker in the Psalm was, in Paul’s view, David, and that his words were his believing answer to a divine promise. But David was dead. Had the ‘sure mercy’ proved, then, a broken reed? Not so: for Jesus, who is Messiah, and is God’s ‘Holy One’ in a deeper sense than David was, has not seen corruption. The Psalmist’s hopes are fulfilled in Him, and through Him, in all who will ‘eat’ that their ‘souls may live,’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. But Paul’s yearning for his brethren’s salvation is not content with proclaiming the fact of Christ’s resurrection, nor with pointing to it as fulfilling prophecy; he gathers all up into a loving, urgent offer of salvation for every believing soul, and solemn warning to despisers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Here the whole man flames out. Here the characteristic evangelical teaching, which is sometimes ticketed as ‘Pauline’ by way of stigma, is heard. Already had he grasped the great antithesis between Law and Gospel. Already his great word ‘justified’ has taken its place in his terminology. The essence of the Epistles to Romans and Galatians is here. Justification is the being pronounced and treated as not guilty. Law cannot justify. ‘In Him’ we are justified. Observe that this is an advance on the previous statement that ‘through Him’ we receive remission of sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘In Him’ points, thought but incidentally and slightly, to the great truth of incorporation with Jesus, of which Paul had afterwards so much to write. The justifying in Christ is complete and absolute. And the sole sufficient condition of receiving it is faith. But the greater the glory of the light the darker the shadow which it casts. The broad offer of complete salvation has ever to be accompanied with the plain warning of the dread issue of rejecting it. Just because it is so free and full, and to be had on such terms, the warning has to be rung into deaf ears, ‘Beware <span class="ital">therefore</span>!’ Hope and fear are legitimately appealed to by the Christian evangelist. They are like the two wings which may lift the soul to soar to its safe shelter in the Rock of Ages.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent....">Acts 13:26-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">Men and brethren </span>— Even all you who are <span class="ital">children of the stock of Abraham </span>— Whether ye are my equals in years, or of more advanced age — <span class="ital">And whosoever among you feareth God </span>— Of whatever family or nation you may be; <span class="ital">unto you is the word of this salvation sent </span>— A great and important salvation, which I am commissioned to preach and offer to mankind. <span class="ital">For they that dwell at Jerusalem, </span>&c. — He here anticipates a strong objection, “Why did not the people at Jerusalem, and especially their rulers, believe?” <span class="ital">They knew him not </span>— Though God bore a most convincing testimony to him by the wonderful miracles which he performed; <span class="ital">nor yet the voices of the prophets </span>— They did not believe in him, because they understood not those very prophets whose writings they read or heard continually.

The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men and brethren - Paul now exhorts them to embrace the Lord Jesus as the Messiah.

This address is made to them in the synagogue, who were Jews by birth, and in a form very grateful and pleasing; he calls them "men", perhaps not only from the common nature of mankind in them, but because they took this name peculiarly to themselves, and denied it to the nations of the world; and which they gather from  <a href="/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Ezekiel 34:31</a> and he styles them "brethren", because they were his countrymen; and "children of the stock of Abraham", with respect to their lineage and descent, and of which they gloried: <p>and whosoever among you feareth God; these were the proselytes among them; See Gill on <a href="/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>. <p>to you is the word of this salvation sent; meaning either the Lord Jesus Christ himself, the essential and eternal "Logos", or word of God, and whom the Syriac and Ethiopic versions here style, "the word of life", as in <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a> who is the author of salvation, and who was in the first place sent unto the Jews; or rather the Gospel, which gives an account of the author of spiritual and eternal salvation, of his person, and of his manner of obtaining it, and of the nature of salvation, and who the persons are to whom it belongs. The Gospel is not a proposal of terms, by complying with which men may be saved, as faith, repentance, and good works, which are not terms of salvation, but either blessings, parts or fruits of it; but it is a declaration of salvation itself, as being a thing done by Christ; it declares him to be the alone able, willing, and all sufficient Saviour, and the salvation he has wrought out to be a great one, complete, spiritual, and everlasting; and that those that believe in him shall be saved with it. It is the word preaching salvation by him, showing, that he has wrought out an everlasting righteousness for the justification of his people; hence it is sometimes called the word of righteousness; and that he has made peace and reconciliation by the blood of his cross, for which reason it is styled the word of reconciliation; and that eternal life is in him, and by him, and therefore it is called the word of life: for the salvation it publishes includes all the blessings of grace, and everlasting glory, and happiness; it is the means of applying the salvation it declares; the Spirit of God comes by it, who, whilst it is preaching, falls upon, and conveys himself into the hearts of men: regeneration is ascribed to the word of truth; faith comes by hearing; and sanctification is promoted and increased by it, as an instrument; and after men believe in it, they are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise; all which shows what a wonderful blessing the Gospel is: and this was now sent not to the Jews only, though to them in the first place, but to the Gentiles also; the Alexandrian copy, in the two last clauses, instead of "you", reads "us". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> Men <i>and</i> brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</span><p>(10) Christ was promised and sent appropriately to the Jews.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a>.
