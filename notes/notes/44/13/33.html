St. Paul’s language, however, is but an echo of St. Peter’s “to us and to our children,” in <a href="/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As it is also written in the second psalm.</span>—The various-reading, “in the <span class= "ital">first</span> Psalm,” given by some MSS. is interesting, as showing that in some copies of the Old Testament, what is now the first Psalm was treated as a kind of prelude to the whole book, the numeration beginning with what is now the second.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</span>—Historically, Psalms 2 appears as a triumph-song, written to celebrate the victory of a king of Israel or Judah—David, or Solomon, or another—over his enemies. The king had been shown by that day of victory to have been the chosen son of God—the day itself was a new begetting, manifesting the sonship. So, in the higher fulfilment which St. Paul finds in Christ, he refers the words, not primarily to the Eternal Generation of the Son of God, “begotten before all worlds,” nor to the Incarnation, but to the day of victory over rulers and priests, over principalities and powers, over death and Hades. The Resurrection manifested in the antitype, as the victory had done in the type, a pre-existing sonship; but it was to those who witnessed it, or heard of it, as the ground on which their faith in that sonship rested. Christ was to them the “firstborn of every creature,” because He was also “the firstborn from the dead.” (See Notes on <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:32-37 The resurrection of Christ was the great proof of his being the Son of God. It was not possible he should be held by death, because he was the Son of God, and therefore had life in himself, which he could not lay down but with a design to take it again. The sure mercies of David are that everlasting life, of which the resurrection was a sure pledge; and the blessings of redemption in Christ are a certain earnest, even in this world. David was a great blessing to the age wherein he lived. We were not born for ourselves, but there are those living around us, to whom we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference; Christ was to serve all generations. May we look to Him who is declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, that by faith in him we may walk with God, and serve our generation according to his will; and when death comes, may we fall asleep in him, with a joyful hope of a blessed resurrection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God hath fulfilled - God has completed or carried into effect by the resurrection of Jesus. He does not say that every part of the promise had reference to his resurrection; but his being raised up completed or perfected the fulfillment of the promises which had been made respecting him.<p>In the second psalm - <a href="/acts/13-7.htm">Acts 13:7</a>.<p>Thou art my Son - This psalm has been usually understood as referring to the Messiah. See the notes on <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>.<p>This day have I begotten thee - It is evident that Paul uses the expression here as implying that the Lord Jesus is called the Son of God because he raised him up from the dead, and that he means to imply that it was for this reason that he is so called. This interpretation of an inspired apostle fixes the meaning of this passage in the psalm, and proves that it is not there used with reference to the doctrine of eternal generation, or to his incarnation, but that he is called his Son because he was raised from the dead. And this interpretation accords with the scope of the psalm. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a> the psalmist records the combination of the rulers of the earth against the Messiah, and their efforts to cast off his reign. This was done, and the Messiah was rejected. All this pertains, not to his previous existence, but to the Messiah on the earth. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4-5</a>, the psalmist shows that their efforts would not be successful; that God would laugh at their designs; that is, that their plans should not succeed.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6-7</a>, he shows that the Messiah would be established as a king; that this was the fixed decree, and that he had been begotten for this. All this is represented as subsequent to the raging of the pagan, and to the counsel of the kings against him, and must, therefore, refer, not to his eternal generation or his incarnation, but to something succeeding his death; that is, to his resurrection, and his establishment as King at the right hand of God. This interpretation by the apostle Paul proves, therefore, that this passage is not to be used to establish the doctrine of the eternal generation of Christ. Christ is called the Son of God for various reasons. In <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>, because he was begotten by the Holy Spirit. In this place, on account of his resurrection. In <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a> it is also said that he was declared to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead. See the notes on that place. The resurrection from the dead is represented as in some sense the beginning of life, and it is with reference to this that the terms "Son," and "begotten from the dead," are used, as the birth of a child is the beginning of life. Thus, Christ is said, <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, to be "the first-born from the dead"; and thus, in <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; he is called "the firsthegotten of the dead"; and with reference to this renewal or beginning of life he is called a Son. In whatever other senses he is called a Son in the New Testament, yet it is here proved:<p>(1) That he is called a Son from his resurrection; and,<p>(2) That this is the sense in which the expression in the psalm is to be used.<p>This day - The words "this day" would naturally, in the connection in which they are found, refer to the time when the "decree" was made. The purpose was formed before Christ came into the world; it was executed or carried into effect by the resurrection from the dead. See the notes on <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>.<p>Have I begotten thee - This evidently cannot be understood in a literal sense. It literally refers to the relation of an earthly father to his children; but in no such sense can it be applied to the relation of God the Father to the Son. It must, therefore, be figurative. The word sometimes figuratively means "to produce, to cause to exist in any way"; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23</a>, "Unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender (beget) strifes." It refers also to the labors of the apostles in securing the conversion of sinners to the gospel: <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>, "In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel"; Plm 1:10, Whom (Onesimus) I have begotten in my bonds. It is applied to Christians: <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>, "Which were born (begotten), not of blood, etc., but of God"; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, Except a man be born (begotten) again," etc. In all these places it is used in a figurative sense to denote "the commencement of spiritual life by the power of God; so raising up stoners from the death of sin, or so producing spiritual life that they should sustain to him the relation of sons." Thus, he raised up Christ from the dead, and imparted life to his body; and hence, he is said figuratively to have begotten him from the dead, and thus sustains toward the risen Saviour the relation of father. Compare <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33.

(Such declarative meaning of the verb "to be" is familiar to every reader of the Bible). See Joh 15:8, "So shall ye be," that is, be seen to be "My disciples."

The natural descendants of them, as Paul and Barnabas, and the Jews in the synagogue, were: <p>in that he hath raised up Jesus again; which may not be understood of his resurrection from the dead, since the promise made, and now fulfilled, has not a single respect to that; but of his being raised up, and sent forth into the world, to be a Saviour and Redeemer, and to sit upon the throne of David, as in <a href="/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a> of which raising of him up to regal dignity, mention is made in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/6-1.htm">Psalm 6:1</a> which is produced as a testimony of it; and the rather this seems to be the sense, since the article of the resurrection of the dead is spoken of in the next verse, as distinct from this; and other passages of Scripture are produced, as speaking of it; though admitting that Christ's resurrection from the dead is here intended, as the Alexandrian copy reads, what follows is very applicable to it, without any detriment to the doctrine of Christ's eternal generation and sonship, as will be hereafter made to appear: <p>as it is written in the second psalm: Beza's most ancient copy, and other very ancient copies, read, "in the first psalm"; for the first and second psalms seem to have been reckoned by the ancient Jews but one psalm, or one section; for so they say (d). <p>""blessed is the man", &amp;c. and "why do the Heathen rage", &amp;c.  , are one "parasha", or section: and they further observe (e), that "every section that was dear to David, he began it with "blessed", and ended it with "blessed"; he began with "blessed", as it is written, <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> "blessed is the man", &amp;c. and he ended it with "blessed", as it is written, <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a> "blessed are all they that put their "trust in him":'' though it is elsewhere said (f), "blessed is the man", &amp;c. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> "and why do the heathen rage", &amp;c. <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a> are two sections; and "to the chief musician on Muth Labben", <a href="/psalms/9-1.htm">Psalm 9:1</a>) and "why standest thou afar off", &amp;c. (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1-18</a>) are two sections.'' <p>And Kimchi calls (g) this psalm, as the generality of copies here do, saying, <p>"this psalm is , "the second psalm."'' <p>And that this psalm belongs to the Messiah, is evident from the mention made of him in <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> from the mad counsel, and vain attempts of the kings of the earth against him, <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. God's decree and resolution to make and declare him King of Zion, notwithstanding all their efforts upon him, <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a> from his asking and having the Gentiles, and uttermost parts of the earth for his inheritance, which is true of no other, <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a> and especially from that reverence, worship, and adoration, which are to be given to him, and that trust and confidence to be placed in him, <a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a> which can by no means agree with David, nor with any mere creature whatever; and as for <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> which is here cited, what is said in that is inapplicable even to angels, <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a> and much more to David, or any mere man. The whole psalm was, by the ancient Jews, interpreted of the Messiah, as is confessed by some of their later doctors. R. David Kimchi says (h), <p>"there are that interpret it of Gog and Magog, and the Messiah, he is the King Messiah; and so the Rabbins of blessed memory interpret it.'' <p>And Jarchi confesses the same, and is somewhat more open in giving his reason for interpreting it otherwise. <p>"Our Rabbins (says he) expound this affair concerning the King Messiah; but according to its literal sense, and for an answer to the heretics (or Christians), it is right to explain it concerning David himself.'' <p>he clause, "and for an answer to the heretics", is left out in later editions, but was in the more ancient ones; it being so open and barefaced, that the Jews did not choose to let it stand. Aben Ezra is in a doubt whether to interpret the psalm of David, or of the Messiah; though he thinks the former is best; and particularly this seventh verse is, by several of their ancient writers, applied to the Messiah; in one of their writings, esteemed very ancient, are these words (i); <p>"from thence shall come forth, in that day, the Messiah of David; and this is the mystery of, "I will declare the decree, the Lord said unto me, thou art my Son", &amp;c.'' <p>And this is the sense of R. Ame (k), a famous ancient doctor of theirs: upon mention of those words in <a href="/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a> "the Lord hath created a new thing", &amp;c. <p>"says R.

The quotation which follows is, according to the present order of the Psalms, taken from <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν τῷ ψαλμῷ</span>, <span class="ital">in the Psalm</span>) Kimichi thinks that this Psalm was written by David about the beginning of his reign. However, that it was written at Jerusalem, may be inferred from the words in <a href="/acts/4-27.htm" title="For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,">Acts 4:27</a>, <span class="ital">in this city</span>.[78] For Sion is mentioned in <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>. Luke mentioned the Psalm without the numeral epithet[79] (see Appar. Crit. p. 622; Ed. ii. pp. 294, 295. Add Hesychius the Presbyter, in the Anecdota Græca of Wolf, T. iii. p. 175): otherwise the word <span class="ital">first</span> would not have been written by some, and <span class="ital">second</span> by others afterwards; nay, the doubt whether it was the first or second Psalm would have never arisen among the ancients. Why should not Luke have also specifically said, at least (<span class="ital">if he specified the Psalm in the former case</span>) at <a href="/acts/13-35.htm" title="Why he said also in another psalm, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 13:35</a>, which makes reference to this <a href="/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>, the 15th or 16th Psalm?

Comp. note on <a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.">Hebrews 5:5</a>, “Christ glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest, but He that said unto Him, Thou art My Son” (not meaning that the priesthood was conferred on Him at the time when the Father said, Thou art My Son, for the Sonship is prior to the Priesthood; but that the Son, who alone was capable of that Priesthood, as such received it from the Father).[80]—<span class="greekheb">σὺ</span>) <span class="ital">Thou</span>, alone, the Messiah. Paul refers, whilst he quotes the chief point, to the whole Psalm, which was well known to his hearers, and especially the second verse, where there is express mention of the Messiah, “The Lord and His <span class="ital">Anointed</span>.” The pronouns, <span class="greekheb">σὺ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="ital">thou, I</span>, are put together in succession with marvellous force.—<span class="greekheb">σήμερον</span>, <span class="ital">this day</span>) The Son of God is indeed from everlasting: but His everlasting nature is never signified by the expression, <span class="ital">this day</span>. Wherefore the words, <span class="ital">This day have I begotten Thee</span>, are used in this sense: <span class="ital">This day I have definitely declared</span>, that <span class="ital">Thou art My Son</span>. The generation, properly so called, is presupposed.

Moreover, a thing is often said to be done then, when it is vividly presented to the eyes as one or about to done: <a href="/2_chronicles/9-6.htm" title="However, I believed not their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: for you exceed the fame that I heard.">2 Chronicles 9:6</a>, The Queen of Sheba to Solomon, “I believed not—until—mine eyes had seen: and the one half—was not told me; for thou hast <span class="ital">added to</span>, <span class="greekheb">προσέθηκας</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> I <span class="ital">see</span> there is <span class="ital">additional</span> greatness in thee <span class="ital">besides</span>), the fame that I heard:” <a href="/joshua/22-31.htm" title="And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.">Joshua 22:31</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐῤῥύσασθε</span>, <span class="ital">ye have delivered</span> (<span class="ital">ye have shown yourselves</span> as <span class="ital">delivering</span>: Phinehas to the children of Reuben): and so <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>, “When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world;” <a href="/acts/1-18.htm" title="Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.">Acts 1:18</a>, note, where Judas is said to have <span class="ital">purchased</span> the field, because he was the occasion of its being purchased, and had himself designed to purchase it: a condensed mode of expression. Glassius has collected more examples out of the sacred writings, l. 3, tr. 3, can. 15; and Linacer, l. 2, at the end, some out of profane authors. The expression <span class="ital">this day</span>, which occurs, <a href="/luke/2-11.htm" title="For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.">Luke 2:11</a>, “Unto you is born <span class="ital">this day</span>,” may be compared.

Observe with what skill the apostle speaks of the resurrection of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise to their fathers, which it was to be presumed they were anxiously expecting. The second psalm. Many manuscripts and editions have, "the first," because the first psalm was often reckoned not numerically but as an introduction to the whole book, so that the second psalm was numbered as the first. This is probably the reason why the eighteen psalms as reckoned by the Jews include <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, though Joshua ben Levi explains it by the rejection of the second psalm, on account, no doubt, of its testimony to Messiah as God's begotten Son. But the rabbins generally acknowledge the application of this psalm to Messiah (Lightfoot, 'Exercit. on the Acts'). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my Son</span>, etc. This application of the second psalm to the Resurrection is best explained by <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>. The reference in both passages to David is remarkable (vers. 22, 23). Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all worlds, was declared before men and angels to be the Son of God, when he was raised from the dead in the power of an endless life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hath fulfilled (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;)<p>Completely fulfilled; force of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;, out and out. </body></html>
