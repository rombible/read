The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he was seen - See the notes at the end of Matthew.<p>Many days - Forty days, <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>.<p>Of them which came up - By the apostles particularly.

This interpretation (Erasmus, Luther, Hammond, Clericus, Heumann, Morus, de Wette, Baumgarten, Lange, and others) is necessarily required by the connection, which is as follows: (1) The Jews have put to death Jesus, though innocent, and buried Him (<a href="/context/acts/13-28.htm" title="And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain....">Acts 13:28-29</a>). (2) But God has raised Him from the dead, as is certain from His appearance among His followers and their testimony (<a href="/context/acts/13-30.htm" title="But God raised him from the dead:...">Acts 13:30-31</a>). (3) <span class="ital">By this resurrection of Jesus</span>, God has completely fulfilled to us the promise, etc. (<a href="/context/acts/13-32.htm" title="And we declare to you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made to the fathers,...">Acts 13:32-33</a>). (4) But the Raised One will, according to God’s assurance, never again die (<a href="/context/acts/13-34.htm" title="And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David....">Acts 13:34-38</a>). This, the only explanation accordant with the context, is confirmed by the purposely chosen <span class="greekheb">ἐκπεπλήρωκε</span>, as, indeed, the fulfilment of the promise begun from the very appearance of Jesus has, although secured already <span class="ital">essentially</span> (as Hofmann interprets the compound verb), only become <span class="ital">complete</span> by His resurrection. It has been objected that <span class="greekheb">ἐκ νεκρῶν</span> would have to be added to <span class="greekheb">ἀναστήσας</span>, as in <a href="/acts/13-34.htm" title="And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.">Acts 13:34</a>; but incorrectly, as the context makes this addition very superfluous, which yet is purposely added in <a href="/acts/13-34.htm" title="And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.">Acts 13:34</a>, in order that the contrast of <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι μέλλοντα ὑποστρέφειν εἰς διαφθοράν</span> might more strongly appear. The textual necessity of our interpretation excludes, accordingly, of itself the <span class="ital">other</span> explanation (Castalio, Calvin, Beza, Grotius, Calovius, Wolf, Bengel, Michaelis, Rosenmüller, Heinrichs, Kuinoel, Olshausen, Hofmann, <span class="ital">Weissag. u. Erf</span>. II. p. 173, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 123, and others), according to which <span class="greekheb">ἀναστήσας</span> is rendered like <span class="greekheb">הֵקִים</span>, prodire jubens, exhibens (<a href="/acts/3-22.htm" title="For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.">Acts 3:22</a>, <a href="/acts/7-37.htm" title="This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear.">Acts 7:37</a>). This rendering would hardly have been adopted and defended, had it not been thought necessary to understand <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a> of the appearance of Jesus upon earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> … <span class="greekheb">γέγραπται</span>] denotes the <span class="greekheb">ἀναστήσας Ἰησοῦν</span> as the event which took place according to (besides other scriptural passages) the saying in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῷ πρώτῳ</span>] Formerly (see Wetstein)—though not universally, yet frequently—the first Psalm was wont not to be separately numbered, but, as an introduction to the Psalter and certainly composed for this object, to be written along with the second Psalm, as it is even now found in MSS. As, however, such a local citation of a passage is found neither in Paul’s writings nor elsewhere in the N.T., it must be assumed that Paul did not himself utter the <span class="greekheb">πρώτῳ</span>, and that it was not even added by Luke; but that he took it over from his documentary source—into which it had doubtless come, because it was esteemed particularly noteworthy that this prophecy should be found written on the very front of the Psalter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">υἱός μου εἶ σὺ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] in the historical sense of the Psalm composed by Solomon on his anointing: My son (as the theocratic king) thou art; I (no other) have this day begotten thee (made thee by thine anointing and installation to be this my son). But, according to the Messianic fulfilment of this divine saying, so far as it has been historically fulfilled (it is otherwise in <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>) especially by the resurrection of the Messiah: My Son (as the Messiah) thou art; I am He who has this day (on the day of the resurrection) begotten Thee, installed Thee into this divine Sonship by the resurrection (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>),—inasmuch, namely, as the resurrection was the actual guarantee, excluding all doubt, of that Sonship of Christ. Thus has God by the resurrection, after His humiliation, although He was from eternity God’s Son, constituted Him the Son of God (He has begotten Him). Comp. <a href="/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a>. The expression is not to be illustrated from <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος ἐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρῶν</span>, <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a> (against Baumgarten); because for denoting the installation into the divine Sonship the figure begotten suits admirably; but, as a new beginner of life (as Baumgarten explains it), Christ would by the resurrection not be begotten, but born. Comp. also <a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>. The <span class="greekheb">σήμερον</span>, moreover, which to those interpreters, who explain the <span class="greekheb">ἀναστήσας</span> generally of the bringing forward Jesus, must appear without significance and included in the quotation only for the sake of completeness (as is, however, not the case even in <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you?

St. Paul thus confirms the statement in <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a> (see note to <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From Galilee to Jerusalem</span>. Who are meant? and what ascent from Galilee to Jerusalem is here intended? The answer to the first question is, the eleven apostles, whose special office it was to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (<a href="/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>, note). The answer to the second is, that the ascent from Galilee, where most of our Lord's appearances took place, to Jerusalem, shortly before the Ascension, is here intended, and that this passage is a distinct recognition by St. Luke of the Galilaean appearances. There is, as is well known, great obscurity, and apparent discrepancies in the accounts of our Lord's appearances after the Resurrection. St. Matthew seems to place them exclusively in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7, 10, 16</a>). St. Mark likewise (16: 7); but in the section 9-20 he mentions the appearance to Mary Magdalene and to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, but gives no clue as to where the appearance to the eleven took place. St. Luke seems to place them exclusively in Judaea, but very curiously puts a mention of Galilee in the angel's mouth in the very place where, according to St. Matthew, he announced the Lord's appearance in Galilee. St. John, again places the three first appearances in Jerusalem (<a href="/john/20.htm">John 20</a>.), but describes at length a third as having taken place in Galilee (<a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2, 14</a>). St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>) speaks of an appearance to five hundred brethren at once, which in all probability took place in Galilee, as only a hundred and twenty names were numbered at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>). It is, therefore, satisfactory to have this confirmation of the residence of the apostles in Galilee between the Resurrection and the Ascension in St. Luke's report of St. Paul's speech. Observe that St. Paul distinctly separates himself from these witnesses by the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 32. </body></html>
