It was no dishonour, but an honour to God, that the tabernacle gave way to the temple; so it is now, that the earthly temple gives way to the spiritual one; and so it will be when, at last, the spiritual shall give way to the eternal one. The whole world is God's temple, in which he is every where present, and fills it with his glory; what occasion has he then for a temple to manifest himself in? And these things show his eternal power and Godhead. But as heaven is his throne, and the earth his footstool, so none of our services can profit Him who made all things. Next to the human nature of Christ, the broken and spiritual heart is his most valued temple.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Heaven is my throne - See the notes on <a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a>.<p>Earth is my footstool - See the notes on <a href="/matthew/5-35.htm">Matthew 5:35</a>.<p>What house ... - What house or temple can be large or magnificent enough for the dwelling of Him who made all things?<p>The place of my rest - My home, my abode, my fixed seat or habitation.

But Stephen's object in mentioning David is to hasten from the tabernacle which he set up, to the temple which his son built, in Jerusalem; and this only to show, from their own Scripture (Isa 66:1, 2), that even that temple, magnificent though it was, was not the proper resting-place of Jehovah upon earth; as his audience and the nations had all along been prone to imagine. (What that resting-place was, even "the contrite heart, that trembleth at God's word," he leaves to be gathered from the prophet referred to).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As appears in the history of the creation, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a></span>.
