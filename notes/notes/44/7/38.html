Of the earlier versions. Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan, had given “congregation.” Even the Rhemish contented itself with “assembly.” The translators of 1611, acting on the instructions which were drawn up for their direction, did not see any reason for making this an exception to the rule, and so gave “church.” Assuming that <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> was so rendered elsewhere, it was, it may be admitted, right, as a matter of consistency, that it should be used here, as presenting the thought, which was emphasised in Stephen’s speech, that the society of believers in Christ was like, in character and in its relation to God, to that of Israel. The new <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> was the development of the old.

He appeared to Moses in a flame of fire, yet the bush was not consumed; which represented the state of Israel in Egypt, where, though they were in the fire of affliction, yet they were not consumed. It may also be looked upon as a type of Christ's taking upon him the nature of man, and the union between the Divine and human nature. The death of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, cannot break the covenant relation between God and them. Our Saviour by this proves the future state, Mt 22:31. Abraham is dead, yet God is still his God, therefore Abraham is still alive. Now, this is that life and immortality which are brought to light by the gospel. Stephen here shows that Moses was an eminent type of Christ, as he was Israel's deliverer. God has compassion for the troubles of his church, and the groans of his persecuted people; and their deliverance takes rise from his pity. And that deliverance was typical of what Christ did, when, for us men, and for our salvation, he came down from heaven. This Jesus, whom they now refused, as their fathers did Moses, even this same has God advanced to be a Prince and Saviour. It does not at all take from the just honour of Moses to say, that he was but an instrument, and that he is infinitely outshone by Jesus. In asserting that Jesus should change the customs of the ceremonial law. Stephen was so far from blaspheming Moses, that really he honoured him, by showing how the prophecy of Moses was come to pass, which was so clear. God who gave them those customs by his servant Moses, might, no doubt, change the custom by his Son Jesus. But Israel thrust Moses from them, and would have returned to their bondage; so men in general will not obey Jesus, because they love this present evil world, and rejoice in their own works and devices.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the church - The word "church" means literally "the people called out," and is applied with great propriety to the assembly or multitude called out of Egypt, and separated from the world. It has not, however, of necessity our idea of a church, but means the "assembly," or people called out of Egypt and placed under the conduct of Moses.<p>With the angel - In this place there is undoubted reference to the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai. Yet that was done by God himself, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>:It is clear, therefore, that by "the angel" here, Stephen intends to designate him who was God. It may be observed, however, that "the Law" is represented as having been given by the ministry of an angel (in this place) and by the ministry of "angels," <a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>. The essential idea is, that God did it by a messenger, or by mediators. The "character" and "rank" of the messengers, or of the "principal" messenger, must be learned by looking at all the circumstances of the case.<p>The lively oracles - See <a href="/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>. The word "oracles" here means "commands" or "laws" of God. The word "lively," or "living" &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  zo&#772;nta, stands in opposition to what is dead, or useless, and means what is vigorous, efficacious; and in this place it means that the commands were of such a nature, and given in such circumstances, as to secure attention; to produce obedience; to excite them to act for God - in opposition to laws which would fall powerless, and produce no effect. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. in the church&#8212;the collective body of God's chosen people; hence used to denote the whole body of the faithful under the Gospel, or particular sections of them.<p>This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel &#8230; and with our fathers&#8212;alike near to the Angel of the Covenant, from whom he received all the institutions of the ancient economy, and to the people, to whom he faithfully reported the living oracles and among whom he set up the prescribed institutions.

Which must be understood of the children of Israel, who were the then church of God, whom he had chosen and separated from the rest of the world, to be a peculiar people to himself, to whom were given the word and ordinances, the service of God, and the promises; and God always had, and will have a church, though that is sometimes in the wilderness; which has been the case under the Gospel dispensation, as well as before; <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a> and it was a peculiar honour to Moses, that he was in this church, though it was in the wilderness; even a greater honour than to be in Pharaoh's court. This has a particular respect to the time when all Israel were encamped at the foot of Mount Sinai, when Moses was not only in the midst of them, and at the head of them; but was <p>with the angel which spake to him in the Mount Sina: this is the same angel as before, in <a href="/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a> and refers either to his speaking to him then, saying, I am the God of thy fathers, &amp;c. which was at Mount Sinai; or rather to the time when the law was given on that mount; and it may be to both; it is true of each, though it, may more especially regard the latter; for it was the angel of the divine presence, the second person in the Trinity, the word of God, that bid Moses come up into the mount; and who spake all the ten words to him; and who is described in so grand and august a manner in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a><p>and with our fathers; the Jewish ancestors, who came out of Egypt under Moses, with whom he was as their deliverer and ruler, their guide and governor: <p>who received the lively oracles to give unto us; he received from the angel which spake to him the law, to deliver to the children of Israel; which is called "the oracles", because it came from God, and contained his mind and will, and was a sure and infallible declaration of it; and "lively" ones, because delivered "viva voce", with an articulate voice, and in audible sounds, and because it is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword. The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions render it, "the words of life": not that the law gives life, or points out the way of life and salvation to sinful men; it is to them all the reverse; it is the killing letter, and the ministration of condemnation and death: it is indeed a rule of life, or of walk and conversation to men, and it promises life in case of perfect obedience, <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a> but this is impracticable by fallen men, and therefore there is no life nor righteousness by the law. Though these lively oracles may be considered in a larger extent, as including all the promises of God respecting the Messiah, delivered to Moses, and all the rites and ordinances of the ceremonial law, which pointed out Christ, as the way of life, righteousness, and salvation, from whence they may very well take this name. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>. <span class="ital">This is he who … had intercourse with the angel … and our fathers</span>, was the mediator (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law?

Perhaps the omission of the word <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> before <span class="greekheb">τῶν πατέρων</span> gives emphasis to the privilege of “our fathers,” when one can speak of being with the angel and with them, Simcox, <span class="ital">Language of the N.

On this effect cp.

It is used in a secular sense in <a href="/acts/19-32.htm">Acts 19:32, 39</a>, and of the congregation of Israel in the LXX. of <a href="/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>; 1 Macc. 2:56; Ecclus. 44:15; and elsewhere. In Stephen's time it could hardly have become widely known as the designation of the flock of Christ. On the whole, the marginal rendering, "the congregation," seems best, but with the idea attached that it was the Lord's congregation. <span class="cmt_word">The angel which spake</span>. It may be doubted whether the phrase, "the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai," refers to the angel spoken of in ver. 30, or to the angel by whose mouth God spake the words of the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1-22</a>. Chrysostom and most commentators seem to understand it of the angel who gave the Law; but Whitby, not without reason, thinks the reference is to the burning bush. <span class="cmt_word">Living oracles</span>. In like manner, St. Paul calls the Holy Scriptures "the oracles of God" (<a href="/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>), and in <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a> we read again of "the first principles of the oracles of God," and St. Peter says, "Let him speak as the oracles of God" (<a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>). For the force of the <span class="accented">living</span> or <span class="accented">lively</span> oracles, see <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23, 25</a>.
