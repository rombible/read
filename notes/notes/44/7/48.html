Stephen had risen to the truth which, though it had been proclaimed before, had been practically dormant. It broke down the thought of any exclusive holiness in the Temple, and therefore placed its downfall among the chances and changes which might be involved in God’s chastisement of the people, and His education of mankind. The inference which we have seen reason to draw as to the probability of some connection, direct or indirect, between Stephen and the Samaritans (see Notes on <a href="/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a> and <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>), suggests the thought that we may trace here something like an echo of the teaching of our Lord in His dialogue with the woman of Samaria (<a href="/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-23</a>). It is a fact of singular interest to note how one who now listened to the words as applied to the Temple of the God of Israel, afterwards embraced them in all their fulness, and used them as his text in asserting the truth they embodied as against the Temples of Zeus and Athenè (<a href="/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;">Acts 17:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As saith the prophet.</span>—The truth which Stephen asserted had been uttered in the very dedication prayer of the Temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm" title="But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?">1Kings 8:27</a>). The builder of the Temple had himself felt that it was the witness not of a localised but a universal Presence. But he turns to what might seem to his hearers a yet higher authority—to the great prophet (<a href="/context/isaiah/66-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build to me? and where is the place of my rest?">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>), who was preeminently the preacher of glad tidings, and who had closed his mission with the utterance of the truth that, whatever glory and greatness might attach to the Temple in Jerusalem, the prayer of him that was “poor and of a contrite spirit” was equally acceptable wherever it might be offered. The words were full of deep meaning in themselves. They were yet more significant as showing that the thoughts of Stephen had been turned to that great close of a great work, and that he must thus have been led to that wider vision of the future when all nations and tongues should be gathered to see the glory of the Eternal; and the work of Israel, especially of those who, like himself, belonged to the Dispersion, should be to declare His glory to the Gentiles, and when they, too, should be accepted as priests and Levites in the true Temple (<a href="/isaiah/66-21.htm" title="And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, said the LORD.">Isaiah 66:21</a>). Here also we may think of him as anticipating the widest and highest teaching of St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,...">Acts 7:48-50</a>. </span><span class="ital">Howbeit </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αλλα</span>, <span class="ital">but, </span>or <span class="ital">yet; </span>we are not to imagine that God permitted a temple to be built even then for his own sake: for it was acknowledged, at the same time, by Solomon himself, that <span class="ital">the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands </span>— Be they ever so rich, splendid, and majestic. <span class="ital">As saith the prophet </span>— Namely, Isaiah, chap. <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build to me? and where is the place of my rest?">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where, speaking in the name of God, he says, <span class="ital">Heaven is my throne, and earth my footstool; </span>and how then should my presence be confined to any particular place? <span class="ital">What house will ye build me — </span>Suitable for me; <span class="ital">saith the Lord: or, what is the place of my rest? </span>— Have I need of rest?

It was no dishonour, but an honour to God, that the tabernacle gave way to the temple; so it is now, that the earthly temple gives way to the spiritual one; and so it will be when, at last, the spiritual shall give way to the eternal one. The whole world is God's temple, in which he is every where present, and fills it with his glory; what occasion has he then for a temple to manifest himself in? And these things show his eternal power and Godhead. But as heaven is his throne, and the earth his footstool, so none of our services can profit Him who made all things.

Stephen was charged with speaking against the temple. He had now shown that he had due veneration for it, by his declaring that it had been built by the command of God. But he "now" adds that God does not need such a temple. Heaven is his throne; the universe his dwelling-place; and "therefore" this temple might be destroyed. A new, glorious truth was to be revealed to mankind, that God was not "confined" in his worship to any age, or people, or nation. In entire consistency, therefore, with all proper respect for the temple at Jerusalem, it might be maintained that the time would come when that temple would be destroyed, and when God might be worshipped by all nations.<p>The Most High - God.

But Stephen's object in mentioning David is to hasten from the tabernacle which he set up, to the temple which his son built, in Jerusalem; and this only to show, from their own Scripture (Isa 66:1, 2), that even that temple, magnificent though it was, was not the proper resting-place of Jehovah upon earth; as his audience and the nations had all along been prone to imagine.

Stephen allows that in the days of Solomon there seemed to be a more permanent abode appointed for God’s worship, but instantly points out that God through His prophet (<a href="/context/isaiah/66-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build to me? and where is the place of my rest?...">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>) had taught that He was not controlled by or confined to any place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ</span>, <span class="ital">not</span>) This particle put in the beginning of the sentence has great force. The same protestation was made by Solomon in the very act of dedicating the temple, <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm" title="But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?">1 Kings 8:27</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ Ὕψιστος</span>, the Highest) An appropriate appellation.
