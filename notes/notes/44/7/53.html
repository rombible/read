Here also St. Paul, in speaking of the Law as “ordained by angels” (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law?

Therefore he broke off, and by the Spirit of wisdom, courage, and power, sharply rebuked his persecutors. When plain arguments and truths provoke the opposers of the gospel, they should be shown their guilt and danger. They, like their fathers, were stubborn and wilful. There is that in our sinful hearts, which always resists the Holy Ghost, a flesh that lusts against the Spirit, and wars against his motions; but in the hearts of God's elect, when the fulness of time comes, this resistance is overcome. The gospel was offered now, not by angels, but from the Holy Ghost; yet they did not embrace it, for they were resolved not to comply with God, either in his law or in his gospel. Their guilt stung them to the heart, and they sought relief in murdering their reprover, instead of sorrow and supplication for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who have received the law - The Law of Moses, given on Mount Sinai.<p>By the disposition of angels - There has been much diversity of opinion in regard to this phrase, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  eis diatagas angelo&#772;n. The word translated "disposition" does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It properly means the "constituting" or "arranging" of an army; disposing it into ranks and proper divisions. Hence, it has been supposed to mean that the Law was given "amidst" the various ranks of angels, being present to witness its promulgation. Others suppose that the angels were employed as agents or instruments to communicate the Law. All that the expression fairly implies is the former; that the Law was given amidst the attending ranks of angels, as if they were summoned to witness the pomp and ceremony of giving "law" to an entire people, and through them to an entire world. It should be added, moreover, that the Jews applied the word "angels" to any messengers of God; to fire, and tempest, and wind, etc. And all that Stephen means here may be to express the common Jewish opinion that God was attended on this occasion by the heavenly hosts, and by the symbols of his presence, fire, and smoke, and tempest. Compare <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>. Other places declare that the Law was spoken by an angel, one eminent above all attending angels, the special messenger of God. See the notes on <a href="/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>. It is plain that Stephen spoke only the common sentiment of the Jews. Thus, Herod is introduced by Josephus (Antiq., book 15, chapter 5, section 3) as saying, "We have learned in God the most excellent of our doctrines, and the most holy part of our Law by angels," etc. In the eyes of the Jews, it justly gave increased majesty and solemnity to the Law, that it had been given in so grand and imposing circumstances. It greatly aggravated their guilt that, notwithstanding this, they had not kept it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53.

Lightfoot (J.) takes the “angels” as = Moses and the Prophets; Surenhusius as = the elders of the people, whilst St. Chrysostom sees a reference to the angel of the burning bush. It must not be thought that St. Stephen is here depreciating the Law. From a Christian standpoint it might of course be urged that as Christ was superior to the angels, so the introduction of angels showed the inferiority of the Law to the Gospel (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>), but St. Stephen’s point is that although the Law had been given with such notable sanctions, yet his hearers had not kept it, and that therefore they, not he, were the real law-breakers.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐφύλαξατε</span>: “cum omnibus <span class="ital">phylacteriis</span> vestris,” Bengel. Note the rhetorical power of the words <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/7-25.htm" title="For he supposed his brothers would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.">Acts 7:25</a> (Page).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">53</span>. <span class="ital">who have received</span>] Better, <span class="ital">ye who received</span> the Law from Sinai.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the disposition of angels</span>] Better, <span class="ital">at the ministration of angels</span>. St Paul (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>) has the same expression concerning the Law, that it was “ministered by angels.” The LXX. have in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, speaking of the giving of the Law, “On his right hand were angels,” and Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiq</span>. xv. 5. 3) represents the same tradition, “We have learned from God the most excellent of our doctrines and the most holy part of our Law by angels.” So <span class="ital">Pesikta Rabbathi</span>, par. 21, “There came down with the Holy One to Sinai twenty-two thousand ministering angels like the camp of the Levites.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and have not kept it</span>] Read, <span class="ital">and kept it not</span>. Stephen here points back along the whole history of the Jews, and shews how the Law, which was intended to lead men to Christ, had not been guarded in its best sense, the spirit having been sacrificed to the letter, and so the result had been that they rejected and slew Him of whom the whole Law was speaking. The Law, given by angels, was the glory of Israel, the perverse use of it had turned to their shame and destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἵτινες</span>, <span class="ital">who</span>) He proves, from the deed which they had perpetrated upon the Christ, that they had not kept the law.

This indicates the majesty of the law: <a href="/galatians/4-14.htm" title="And my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.">Galatians 4:14</a>, “Ye received me <span class="ital">as an angel of God</span>.” The angels on Sinai appeared under the appearance of a flame. Comp. <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a> (<span class="greekheb">διαταγεὶς δἰ ἀγγέλων</span>), <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς</span>, <span class="ital">at, in respect to</span>, or <span class="ital">by reason of</span>, as in <a href="/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a> (<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν</span>: he staggered not at it in unbelief, as being the promise of God). The Jews received the law as that which was to be regarded in the light that angelical ordinances would deserve to be regarded; namely, with the highest reverence. God has the angels for His ministers. Hence, what is angelic, is certainly also divine.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐφυλάξατε</span>, <span class="ital">have not kept</span> it) with all your <span class="ital">phylacteries</span> [alluding to the verb <span class="greekheb">ἐφύλαξατε</span>]. He who believes on Christ, establishes the law: he who sets aside Christ, sets aside the law. Reason would think that these last words of Stephen ought to have been suppressed by him, because he had by this time completed his defence. But in the state of one making confession of the truth, all things ought to be said, which the glory of GOD and the salvation of the hearers demand.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> <span class="accented">- Ye who received</span> for <span class="accented">who have received</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">as it was ordained by angels</span> for <span class="accented">by the disposition of angels</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">kept it not</span> for <span class="accented">hove not kept it</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ordained by angels</span>.

So here they received the Law "at" or "on the occasion of," the "ordering" or "appointing" of angels. When the angels, who were commissioned by God and spoke in his Name, gave the Law, the Israelites so received it. The A.V., "by the disposition of angels" very nearly ex- presses the true sense. Another sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> - "in view of" - comes to nearly the same thing. St. Paul speaks of the part taken by the angels in the giving of the Law, and in language strikingly resembling the text. He says of it, that it was "ordained through ['by,' A V] angels" God ordained or appointed the Law, but the angels were the instruments or ministers of its promulgation. And it is also distinctly referred to in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, where the LXX. read, "On his right hand the angels were with him." In the foregoing verses the application which Stephen had all through been contemplating is hurled with accumulated force at the consciences of his hearers, and cuts them to the heart, but does not bring them to repentance. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Stronger than the simple relative who, and emphasizing their sin by contrast with their privileges: inasmuch as ye were those who received, etc.<p>By the disposition of angels (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., unto ordinances of angels. &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; means with reference to.

The kindred verb &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; occurs often, and mostly in the sense of command or appoint.

The reference is most probably to the Jewish tradition that the law was given through the agency of angels. See <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>. Compare <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>. Paul expressly says that the law was administered by the medium of angels (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>).
