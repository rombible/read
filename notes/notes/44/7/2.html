(1) It is clearly an unfinished fragment, interrupted by the clamours of the by-standers (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>)—the <span class= "ital">torso, </span>as it were, of a great <span class= "ital">apologia.</span> Its very incompleteness, the difficulty of tracing the argument as far as it goes, because we do not see how far it was meant to go, are indirect proofs that we have a true, though not necessarily a verbatim, report. A later writer, composing a speech after the manner of Herodotus and Thucydides, would have made it a much more direct answer to the charges in the indictment. And this, in its turn, supplies a reasonable presumption in favour of other speeches reported by the same author. (2) Looking to the relations between St. Luke and St. Paul, and to the prominence of the latter among the accusers of Stephen, there is a strong probability that the report was derived from him. This is confirmed by some instances of remarkable parallelism between the speech and his later teaching. (Comp. <a href="/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48</a>, <a href="/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;">Acts 17:24</a>). (3) The speech is the first great survey of the history of Israel as a process of divine education—the first development from the lips of a human teacher of principles that had before been latent. As such, it contains the germs which were, in their turn, to be afterwards developed, on the one hand, by St. Paul in the Epistles known to be his, on the other hand by Apollos, or whoever was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. (4) The speech is also remarkable as bringing together within a comparatively small compass a considerable number of real or seeming inaccuracies in the details of the history which is commented on. Whether they are real or apparent will be discussed as we deal with each of them. It is obvious that the results thus arrived at will form something like a crucial test of theories which men have formed as to the nature and limits of inspiration. (5) As Stephen was a Hellenistic or Greek-speaking Jew, it is probable that the speech was delivered in Greek, and so far it confirms the inference which has been drawn from the Aramaic words specially recorded in our Lord’s teaching—“Ephphatha,” “Talitha cumi,” and the cry upon the cross—that He habitually used the former language, and that this was the medium of intercourse between the priests and Pilate. (See Notes on <a href="/mark/5-41.htm" title="And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say to you, arise.">Mark 5:41</a>; <a href="/mark/7-34.htm" title="And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.">Mark 7:34</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The God of glory.</span>—The opening words are an implied answer to the charge of blaspheming God. The name contained an allusive reference to the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, which was the symbol of the Presence of Jehovah. That was the “glory of the Lord.” He, in like manner, was the “Lord of glory.” (Comp. <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Before he dwelt in Charran.</span>—We come, at the very outset, on one of the difficulties above referred to. Here the call of Abraham is spoken of as <span class= "ital">before</span> he sojourned in Haran, or Charran, west of the Euphrates. In <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a> it is first mentioned <span class= "ital">after</span> Abraham’s removal thither. On the other hand, <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm" title="And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.">Genesis 15:7</a> speaks of God as bringing him “from Ur of the Chaldees”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from Mesopotamia, or the east of the Euphrates; and this is confirmed by <a href="/joshua/24-3.htm" title="And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.">Joshua 24:3</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/9-7.htm" title="You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;">Nehemiah 9:7</a>. The language of writers contemporary with Stephen (Philo, <span class= "ital">De Abrah</span>.; Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> i. 7, § 1) lays stress, as he does, on the first call as well as the second. Here, accordingly, it cannot be said that the statement is at variance with the Old Testament narrative. The word <span class= "ital">Mesopotamia</span> was used by the LXX., and has thence passed into later versions, for the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Aram-Naharaim, </span>“Syria of the two rivers” (<a href="/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-4.htm" title="Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>; <a href="/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8</a>), and, less accurately, for Padan-Aram in <a href="/genesis/25-20.htm" title="And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.">Genesis 25:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-2.htm" title="Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from there of the daughers of Laban your mother's brother.">Genesis 28:2</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/28-5.htm" title="And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.">Genesis 28:5-6</a>; where our version retains the Hebrew name.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values himself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men, brethren, and fathers - These were the usual titles by which the Sanhedrin was addressed. In all this Stephen was perfectly respectful, and showed that he was disposed to render due honor to the institutions of the nation.<p>The God of glory - This is a Hebrew form of expression denoting "the glorious God." It properly denotes His "majesty, or splendor, or magnificence"; and the word "glory" is often applied to the splendid appearances in which God has manifested Himself to people, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-7.htm">Exodus 16:7</a>, <a href="/exodus/16-10.htm">Exodus 16:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-23.htm">Leviticus 9:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>. Perhaps Stephen meant to affirm that God appeared to Abraham in some such glorious or splendid manifestation, by which he would know that he was addressed by God. Stephen, moreover, evidently uses the word "glory" to repel the charge of "blasphemy" against God, and to show that he regarded him as worthy of honor and praise.<p>Appeared ... - In what manner he appeared is not said. In <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, it is simply recorded that God "had said" unto Abraham, etc.<p>Unto our father - The Jews valued themselves much on being the children of Abraham. See the notes on <a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>. The expression was therefore well calculated to conciliate their minds.<p>When he was in Mesopotamia - In <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, it is said that Abraham dwelt "in Ur of the Chaldees." The word "Mesopotamia" properly denotes the region between the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris. See notes on <a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>. The name is Greek, and the region had also other names before the Greek name was given to it. In <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>, it is called Ur of the Chaldees. Mesopotamia and Chaldea might not exactly coincide; but it is evident that Stephen meant to say that "Ur" was in the country afterward called Mesopotamia. Its precise situation is unknown. A Persian fortress of this name is mentioned by Ammianus <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a> between Nisibis and the Tigris.<p>Before he dwelt in Charran - From <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, it would seem that Terah took his son Abraham of his own accord, and removed to Haran. But from <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>, it appears that God had commanded "Abraham" to remove, and so he ordered it in his providence that "Terah" was disposed to remove his family with an intention of going into the land of Canaan. The word "Charran" is the Greek form of the Hebrew "Haran," <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>. This place was also in Mesopotamia, in 36 degrees 52 minutes north latitude and 39 degrees 5 minutes east longitude. Here Terah died <a href="/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>; and to this place Jacob retired when he fled from his brother Esau, <a href="/genesis/27-43.htm">Genesis 27:43</a>. It is situated "in a flat and sandy plain, and is inhabited by a few wandering Arabs, who select it for the delicious water which it contains" (Robinson's Calmet). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-5.

Stephen replied, in answer to the high priest's question, and addressed himself to the whole sanhedrim, saying: <p>men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; to the following oration and defence; he calls them men, brethren, by an usual Hebraism, that is, "brethren"; and that, because they were of the same nation; for it was common with the Jews to call those of their own country and religion, brethren; and he calls them "fathers", because of their age and dignity, being the great council of the nation, and chosen out of the senior and wiser part of the people: <p>the God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham; he calls God "the God of glory", because he is glorious in himself, in all his persons, perfections, and works, and is to be glorified by his people; and his glory is to be sought by all his creatures, and to be the end of all their actions; and the rather he makes use of this epithet of him, to remove the calumny against him, that he had spoke blasphemous things against God; and because God appeared in a glorious manner to Abraham, either in a vision, or by an angel, or in some glorious form, or another; and it is observable, that when the Jews speak of Abraham's deliverance out of the fiery furnace, for so they interpret Ur of the Chaldees, they give to God much such a title; they say (r). <p>""the King of glory" stretched out his right hand, and delivered him out of the fiery furnace, according to  <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>.'' <p>Stephen uses a like epithet; and he calls Abraham "our father", he being a Jew, and according to the common usage of the nation: and this appearance of God to Abraham was "when he was in Mesopotamia"; a country that lay between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates, from whence it had its name; and is the same with Aram Naharaim, the Scriptures speak of; See Gill on <a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>. Of this appearance of God to Abraham, mentioned by Stephen, the Scriptures are silent; but the Jewish writers seem to hint at it, when they say (s), <p>"thus said the holy blessed God to Abraham, as thou hast enlightened for me Mesopotamia and its companions, come and give light before me in the land of Israel.'' <p>And again, mentioning those words in <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a> "the seed of Abraham my friend, whom I have taken from the ends of the earth"; add by way of explanation, from Mesopotamia and its companions (t): and this was <p>before he dwelt in Charan; or Haran; see <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a> where the Septuagint call it "Charan", as here; and by Herodish (u) it is called  where Antoninus was killed; and by Pliny (w), "Carra"; and by Ptolomy (x), "Carroe"; it was famous for the slaughter of M. Crassus, by the Parthians (y). R. Benjamin gives this account of it in his time (z); <p>"in two days I came to ancient Haran, and in it were about twenty Jews, and there was as it were a synagogue of Ezra; but in the place where was the house of Abraham our father, there was no building upon it; but the Ishmaelites (or Mahometans) honour that place, and come thither to pray.'' <p>Stephanus (a) says it was a city of Mesopotamia, so called from "Carra", a river in Syria. <p>(r) Pirke Eliezer, c. 26.

This discrepancy[196] is not to be set at rest by the usual assumption that Stephen here follows a tradition probably derived from <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm" title="And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.">Genesis 15:7</a>, comp. <a href="/nehemiah/9-7.htm" title="You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;">Nehemiah 9:7</a> (Philo, <span class="ital">de Abr.</span> II. pp. 11, 16, ed. Mang.; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> i. 7. 1; see Krause, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 11), that Abraham had already had a divine vision at Ur, to which Stephen refers, while in Genesis 12 there is recorded that which afterwards happened at Haran. For the verbal quotation, <a href="/acts/7-3.htm" title="And said to him, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I shall show you.">Acts 7:3</a>, admits of no other historical reference than to <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a>. Stephen has thus, according to the text, <span class="ital">erroneously</span> (speaking off-hand in the hurry of the moment, how easily might he do so!) transferred the theophany that happened to Abraham at <span class="ital">Haran</span> to an earlier period, that of his abode in <span class="ital">Ur</span>, full of the thought that God even in the earliest times undertook the guidance of the people afterwards so refractory! This is simply to be admitted (Grotius: “Spiritus sanctus apostolos et evangelistas confirmavit in doctrina evangelica; in ceteris rebus, si Hieronymo credimus, ut hominibus, reliquit quae sunt hominum”), and not to be evaded by having recourse (see Luger after Beza, Calvin, and others) to an anticipation in <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>, according to which the vision contained in <a href="/acts/12-1.htm" title="Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.">Acts 12:1</a> is supposed to have <span class="ital">preceded</span> the departure from Ur; or, by what professes to be a more profound entering into the meaning, to the arbitrary assumption “that Abraham took an independent share in the transmigration of the children of Terah from Ur to Haran” (Baumgarten, p. 134), to which primordial hidden beginning of the call of Abraham the speaker goes back.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ Μεσοποτ</span>.] for the land of <span class="ital">Ur</span> (<span class="greekheb">אוּר כַּשְׂדִּים</span>, <a href="/genesis/11-28.htm" title="And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.">Genesis 11:28</a>) was situated in northern Mesopotamia, which the Chaldeans inhabited; but is not to be identified with that Ur, which Ammianus Marc. xxv. 8 mentions as <span class="ital">castellum Persicum</span>, whose situation must be conceived as farther south than Haran.

If it were sketched after mere tradition or acquired information, or from a quite independent ideal point of view, then either the historical part would be placed in more direct relation to the points of the charge and brought into rhetorical relief, or the whole plan would shape itself otherwise in keeping with the question put in <a href="/acts/7-1.htm" title="Then said the high priest, Are these things so?">Acts 7:1</a>; the striking power and boldness of speech, which only break forth in the smallest portion (<a href="/context/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,...">Acts 7:48-53</a>), would be more diffused over the whole, and the historical mistakes—which have nothing surprising in them in the case of a discourse delivered on the spur of the moment—would hardly occur.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But <span class="ital">how is the authentic reproduction of the discourse</span>, which must in the main be assumed, <span class="ital">to be explained?</span> Certainly not by supposing that the whole was, either in its main points (Krause, Heinrichs) or even verbally (Kuinoel), taken down in the place of meeting by some person unknown (Riehm, <span class="ital">de fontib. Act. ap.</span> p. 195 f., conjectures: by <span class="ital">Saul</span>). It is extremely arbitrary to carry back such shorthand-writing to the public life of those times. The most direct solution would no doubt be given, if we could assume notes of the speech made by the speaker himself, and preserved. But as this is not here to be thought of, in accordance with the whole spirit of the apostolic age and with <a href="/acts/6-12.htm" title="And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came on him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,">Acts 6:12</a>, it only remains as the most natural expedient: <span class="ital">to consider the active memory of an ear-witness, or even several, vividly on the stretch, and quickened even by the purpose of placing it on record, as the authentic source;</span> so that, immediately after the tragical termination of the judicial procedure, what was heard with the deepest sympathy and eagerness was noted down from fresh recollection, and afterwards the record was spread abroad by copies, and was in its substantial tenor adopted by Luke. The purely historical character of the contents, and the steady chronological course of the greater part of the speech, remove any improbability of its being with sufficient faithfulness taken up by the memory. As regards the <span class="ital">person</span> of the reporter, no definite conjectures are to be ventured on (Olshausen, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, refers to <a href="/acts/6-7.htm" title="And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.">Acts 6:7</a>; Luger and Baumgarten, to the intervention of <span class="ital">Saul</span>); and only this much is to be assumed as probable, that he was no hostile listener, but a <span class="ital">Christian</span> (perhaps a <span class="ital">secret</span> Christian in the Sanhedrim itself),—a view favoured by the diffusion, which we must assume, of the record, and more especially by the circumstance, that <a href="/context/acts/7-54.htm" title="When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth....">Acts 7:54-60</a> forms one whole with the reproduction of the speech interrupted at <a href="/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>, and has doubtless proceeded from the same authentic source. With this view even the <span class="ital">historical errors</span> in the speech do not conflict; with regard to which, however,—especially as they are based in part on traditions not found in the O. T.,—it must remain undetermined how far they are attributable to the speaker himself or to the reporter. At all events, these historical mistakes of the speech form a strong proof in what an unaltered form, with respect to its historical data, the speech has been preserved from the time of its issuing from the hands that first noted it down.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From this view it is likewise evident in what sense we are to understand its <span class="ital">originality</span>, namely, not as throughout a verbal reproduction, but as correct <span class="ital">in substance</span>, and <span class="ital">verbal only so far, as</span>—setting aside the literary share, not to be more precisely determined, which Luke himself had in putting it into its present shape—it was possible and natural for an intentional exertion of the memory to retain not only the style and tone of the discourse on the whole, but also in many particulars the verbal expression. Definitions of a more precise character cannot psychologically be given. According to Baur and Zeller the speech is a later composition, “at the foundation of which, historically considered, there is hardly more than an indefinite recollection of the general contents of what was said by Stephen, and perhaps even only of his principles and mode of thought;” the exact recollection of the speech and its preservation are inconceivable; the artificial plan, closely accordant with its theme, betrays a premeditated elaboration; the author of the Acts unfolds in it his own view of the relation of the Jews to Christianity; the discussion before the Sanhedrim itself is historically improbable, etc.; Stephen is “the Jerusalem type of the Apostle of the Gentiles.” See in opposition to Baur, Schneckenburger in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1855, p. 527 ff. Bruno Bauer has gone to the extreme of frivolous criticism: “The speech is fabricated, as is the whole framework of circumstances in which it occurs, and the fate of Stephen.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[190] Comp. Calvin: “Stephani responsio prima specie absurda et inepta videri posset.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Interpreters, moreover, are much divided in their views concerning <span class="ital">the relation of the contents to the points of complaint contained in</span> <a href="/context/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:...">Acts 6:13-14</a>. Among the older interpreters—the most of whom, such as Augustine, Beza, and Calvin, have recourse to merely incidental references, without any attempt to enter into and grasp the unity of the speech—the opinion of Grotius is to be noted: that Stephen wished indirectly, in a historical way, to show that the favour of God is not bound to any place, and that the Jews had no advantage over those who were not Jews, in order thereby to justify his prediction concerning the destruction of the temple and the call of the Gentiles.[191] But the very supposition, that the teaching of the call of the Gentiles was the one point of accusation against Stephen, is arbitrary; and the historical proofs adduced would have been very ill chosen by him, seeing that in his review of history it is always this very Jewish people that appears as distinguished by God. The error, so often committed, of inserting between the lines the main thoughts as indirectly indicated, vitiates the opinion of Heinrichs, who makes Stephen give a defence of his conversion to Christ as the true Messiah expected by the fathers; as well as the view of Kuinoel, that Stephen wished to prove that the Mosaic ceremonial institutions, although they were divine, yet did not make a man acceptable to God; that, on the contrary, without a moral conversion of the people, the destruction of the temple was to be expected. Olshausen stands in a closer and more direct relation to the matter, when he holds that <span class="ital">Stephen narrates the history of the O. T. so much at length, just to show the Jews that he believed in it, and thus to induce them, through their love for the national history, to listen with calm attention. The nature of the history itself fitted it to form a mirror to his hearers, and particularly to bring home to their minds the circumstance that the Jewish people, in all stages of their development and of the divine revelation, had resisted the Spirit of God, and that, consequently, it was not astonishing that they should now show themselves once more disobedient</span>. Yet Olshausen himself does not profess to look upon this reference of the speech as “with definite purpose aimed at.” In a more exact and thorough manner, Baur, whom Zeller in substance follows, has laid down as the leading thought: “<span class="ital">Great and extraordinary as were the benefits which God from the beginning imparted to the people, equally ungrateful in return and antagonistic to the divine designs was from the first the disposition of that people</span>.” Comp. already Bengel: “Vos autem semper mali fuistis,” etc. In this case, however, as Zeller thinks, there is brought into chief prominence the <span class="ital">reference to the temple</span> in <span class="ital">respect to the charges raised</span>, and that in such a way <span class="ital">that</span> the very <span class="ital">building of the</span> <span class="ital">temple itself</span> was meant to be presented as a proof of the <span class="ital">perversity</span> of the people,—a point of view which is foreign to Stephen, and arbitrarily forced on his words, as it would indeed in itself be unholy and impious (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm" title="He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-5.htm" title="And, behold, I purpose to build an house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build an house to my name.">1 Kings 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-12.htm" title="Concerning this house which you are in building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with you, which I spoke to David your father:">1 Kings 6:12</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm" title="Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>); comp. on <a href="/context/acts/7-49.htm" title="Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will you build me? said the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?...">Acts 7:49-50</a>. With reason, Luger (who yet goes too far in the references of details), Thiersch, Baumgarten, and F. Nitzsch have adhered to the <span class="ital">historical</span> standpoint given in <a href="/context/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:...">Acts 6:13-14</a>, and kept strictly in view the <span class="ital">apologetic</span> aim of the speech (comp. also de Wette); along with which, however, Thiersch and Baumgarten not without manifold caprice exaggerate, in the histories brought forward by Stephen, the <span class="ital">typical</span> reference and allegorical application of them (by which they were to serve as a mirror to the present) as designed by him,[192] as is also done in the <span class="ital">Erlang. Zeitschr.</span> 1859, p. 311 ff. Rauch is of opinion that the speech is directed against <span class="ital">the meritoriousness of the temple-worship and of the works of the law</span>, inasmuch as it lays stress, on the contrary, upon <span class="ital">God’s free and unmerited grace and election</span> (a similar view was already held by Calvin); but to this there remains the decisive counter-argument, that the assumed <span class="ital">point</span> (the non-meritorious nature of grace and election) is not at all expressly brought out by Stephen or subjected to more special discussion. Moreover, Rauch starts from the supposition that the assertion of the witnesses in <a href="/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a> was <span class="ital">true</span> (see, against this, on <a href="/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:">Acts 6:13</a>), inasmuch as Stephen had actually said what was adduced at <a href="/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But if the assertion in <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄνδρες ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> St. Paul’s address, <a href="/acts/22-1.htm" title="Men, brothers, and fathers, hear you my defense which I make now to you.">Acts 22:1</a>, and also note on <a href="/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>.

The appearances to Abraham and Moses were similar to those later ones to which the term Shechinah was applied. Such words were in themselves an answer to the charge of blasphemy; but Stephen proceeds to show that this same God who dwelt in the Tabernacle was not confined to it, but that He appeared to Abraham in a distant heathen land. <span class="greekheb">ὤφθη</span>: there was therefore no need of a Temple that God might appear to His own (Chrys., <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, xv.; see Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>).—<span class="greekheb">τῷ πατρὶ ἡμῶν</span>: emphatic, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/7-19.htm" title="The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.">Acts 7:19</a>; <a href="/context/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:...">Acts 7:38-39</a>; <a href="/context/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen....">Acts 7:44-45</a>; St. Stephen thus closely associates himself with his hearers. Wetstein comments: “Stephanus ergo non fuit proselytus, sed Judæus natus,” but it would seem from Wetstein himself that a proselyte might call Abraham father; <span class="ital">cf.</span> his comment on <a href="/luke/1-73.htm" title="The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,">Luke 1:73</a>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/44-21.htm" title="With Isaac did he establish likewise for Abraham his father's sake the blessing of all men, and the covenant,">Sir 44:21</a>; <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span>, “Apocrypha,” vol. ii.; see also Lumby’s note, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. ii., p. 326, note, E.T.—<span class="greekheb">Μεσοποταμίᾳ</span>: a difficulty at once arises in comparing this statement with the Book of Genesis. Here the call of Abraham is said to have come to him <span class="ital">before</span> he dwelt in Haran, but in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a>, <span class="ital">after</span> he removed thither. But, at the same time <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm" title="And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.">Genesis 15:7</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/joshua/24-3.htm" title="And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.">Joshua 24:3</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/9-7.htm" title="You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;">Nehemiah 9:7</a>, distinctly intimates that Abraham left “Ur of the Chaldees” (see “Abraham,” Hastings’ B.D., p. 14, and Sayce, <span class="ital">Patriarchal Palestine</span>, pp. 166–169, as to its site) in accordance with the choice and guidance of God. St. Stephen applies the language of what we may describe as the second to the first call, and in so doing he was really following on the lines of Jewish literature, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Philo, <span class="ital">De Abrah.</span>, ii., 11, 16, Mang., paraphrases the divine counsel, and then adds <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο τὴν πρώτην ἀποικίαν ἀπὸ τῆς Χαλδαίων γῆς εἰς τὴν χαῤῥαίων λέγεται ποιεῖσθαι</span>. Moreover the manner of St. Stephen’s quotation seems to mark the difference between the call in Ur and the call in Haran (R.V., not Charran, Greek form, as in A.V.). In <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a> we have the call to Abraham in Haran given as follows: <span class="greekheb">ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας σου καὶ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου</span>. But the call in Ur, according to St. Stephen’s wording, is one which did not involve the sacrifice of his family, for Abraham was accompanied by them to Haran, and so the clause <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is omitted because inappropriate. Of course if we omit <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> before <span class="greekheb">τῆς συγγενείας</span> (see critical notes), St. Stephen’s words become more suitable still to the position of Abraham in Ur, for we should then translate the words, “from thy land and the land of thy kindred” (Rendall, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Hor. Heb.</span>). St. Stephen may naturally have referred back to Abraham’s first migration from Ur to Haran, as desiring to emphasise more plainly the fact that since the call of God came to him before he had taken even the first step towards the Holy Land by settling in Haran, that divine revelation was evidently not bound up with any one spot, however holy.—<span class="greekheb">Χαῤῥὰν</span>, <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/12-5.htm" title="And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.">Genesis 12:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-43.htm" title="Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;">Genesis 27:43</a>, LXX, in the old language of Chaldea = road (see Sayce, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, pp. 166, 167, and “Haran” Hastings’ B.D., and B.D.2, i.

It is not possible to determine the site of Ur, but the most probable opinion seems to be that which places it at Edessa, now called <span class="ital">Orfah</span>, and said to have been called <span class="ital">Orrha</span> in early times. If this were the place the journey thence to Charran (O.T. Haran), i.e. <span class="ital">Carrhæ</span>, would not have been so very formidable for the father of the patriarch to undertake, and at Charran Terah remained till he died (<a href="/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a>). Abraham when without his father could remove with greater ease to the distant Canaan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our father Abraham</span>] If Stephen were merely a proselyte he might yet use this expression, for Abraham is regarded as the father of proselytes.

Yet, if so, why does it say they <span class="ital">made</span> them? This is to teach thee that when anybody brings near the stranger, and makes him a proselyte, it is as good as if he had created him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before he dwelt in Charran</span>] The Greek verb rendered dwelt is one which implies a settled residence, though it conveys no idea of permanent abode. It is used (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm" title="And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.">Matthew 2:23</a>) of Joseph and Mary <span class="ital">dwelling</span> at Nazareth, and (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>) of Christ’s less fixed <span class="ital">dwelling</span> in Capernaum.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες</span>, <span class="ital">brethren and fathers</span>) Stephen, being a young man, addresses them according to their different ages.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δόξης</span>, <span class="ital">the God of glory</span>) The sum of the Divine praise. <span class="ital">Glory</span> is the Divinity manifest.

He adds "and fathers" out of respect to the elder and more dignified portion of the Sanhedrim. It seems probable that Stephen, as a Hellenist Jew, spoke in Greek, which is borne out by the quotations being from the LXX. (see Alford), though Meyer and others think he spoke in Hebrew. Greek was generally understood at this time by all educated persons (see Roberts, 'Discussions on Gospels,' <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. - 7.). The speech itself is almost universally admitted to bear strong internal marks of genuineness and originality. But different estimates have been formed of its excellence, and different explanations given of its scope and object. Difficult but striking; long and prolix;" "at first sight absurd and out of place;" "wonderful but difficult;" "of inestimable value;" "a speech containing many things which don't seem much to the point;" "a powerful speech;" a speech combining "the address of the advocate and the boldness of the martyr;" - are some of the estimates that have been formed of it by modern commentators. As regards its scope and object, the two main clues to it are the accusation which Stephen rose to rebut, and the application with which he ended in vers. 51-53. If we keep these two things steadily in view, we shall not be very far wrong if we say that Stephen sought to clear himself by showing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by his historical summary, what a true and thorough Israelite he was in heart and feeling and fellowship with the fathers of his race, and therefore how unlikely to speak blasphemous words against either Moses or the temple; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> how Moses himself had foretold the coming of Christ as a prophet like himself, to enunciate some new doctrines; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> how at every stage of their history their fathers had resisted those who were sent to them by God, and that now his judges were playing the same part. Perhaps it may be further true, as Chrysostom explains it (Hom. 15, 16, 17.), that his intention in the early part of the speech was to show "that the promise was made before the place, before circumcision, before sacrifice, before the temple," in accordance with St. Paul's argument (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16-18</a>); and that therefore the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant could not be dependent upon the Law or the temple. <span class="cmt_word">The God of glory</span>. This unusual phrase identifies God, of whom Stephen speaks, with the God whose visible glory was seen by the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-2.htm">Genesis 26:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12, 13</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16, 17</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>; <a href="/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>). St. Paul uses a similar phrase, "The Lord of glory '(<a href="/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>). Our father. He thus identifies himself with his judges, whom he had just called "brethren." In <span class="cmt_word">Mesopotamia</span>, which would be in Hebrew "Aram of the two rivers." The exact place, as we learn from <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, was "Ur of the Chaldees;" whence the Israelites were taught to say (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>), "An Aramcan ready to perish was my father." That this appearance was in Ur, <span class="cmt_word">before he dwelt in Haran</span>, is manifest from <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, because it is there said that they went forth from Ur "to go into the land of Canaan," which makes it quite certain that the appearance of God to Abraham had preceded their leaving Ur, and was the cause of it. And this is confirmed by <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; and Josephus ('Ant.,' 1. 7:1). Moreover, the very language of the call shows plainly that it came to him when he was living in his native country, among his kindred, and in his father's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at Ur, not in Haran, where they were only sojourners. There is nothing the least unusual, in Hebrew narrative, in the writer going back to any point in the preceding narrative with which the subsequent narrative is connected. <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. I precedes in point of time <a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>; similar examples are <a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5, 6</a>; <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a> compared with <a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20, 21</a>, compared with <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>; and many more. It is, however, of course possible that a fresh call may have been given after Terah's death, though it is by no means necessary to suppose it. Another imaginary difficulty arises from the statement in <a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a> that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran, that Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and that Terah died at the age of two hundred and five; and from the statement in ver. 4 of this chapter that Abram did not leave Haran till Terah's death. From which it is concluded that Terah must have lived sixty years after Abram's departure (70 + 75 + 60   =   205). But the whole difficulty arises from the gratuitous supposition that Abram was Terah's firstborn because he is named first. If Terah were a hundred and thirty at the birth of Abram, he would be two hundred and five when Abram was seventy-five. Now, there is absolutely nothing to forbid the supposition that such was his age. It does not follow that because Abram is named first he was the eldest. He might be named first as being by far the most illustrious of the three, he might be named first because the subsequent genealogies - Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve Patriarchs - were deduced from him. There may, too, have been other sons of Terah, not named here because nothing was going to be said about them. Nahor is mentioned because Rebekah was his granddaughter (<a href="/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15, 24</a>) and Rachel his great-granddaughter. And Haran is mentioned because he was the father of Lot. Others, whether sons or daughters, would not be mentioned. If Terah, therefore, began to have children when he was seventy, it is quite probable that Abram may not have been born till he was a hundred and thirty. That the son named first need not necessarily be the eldest is clear from the order in which Shem, Ham, and Japheth are named, whereas it appears from <a href="/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a> that Ham was the youngest, and from <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2, 21</a> (according to the A.V. and the LXX., Symmachus, the Targum of Onkelos, and the old Jewish commentators), that Japheth was the eldest. In <a href="/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a> God says, "I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau," though Esau was the elder; and so <a href="/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>. So again in <a href="/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20</a> we read, "Moses and Aaron" (see also <a href="/exodus/40-31.htm">Exodus 40:31</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-43.htm">Numbers 16:43</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-5.htm">Joshua 24:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>; etc.), though it appears from <a href="/1_chronicles/6-3.htm">1 Chronicles 6:3</a> that Aaron was the eldest. So again we read in <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, "Thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh," and in ver. 20, "God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh," though in ver. I of the same chapter they are named according to the true order of birth - "Manasseh and Ephraim." It is, therefore, an unwarrantable inference that Abram was the eldest son because he is named first; and with the removal of this inference the difficulty vanishes; and Stephen was quite accurate when he said that God appeared to Abraham in Ur, before he dwelt in Haran, and that he did not move from Haran till the death of Terah. <span class="cmt_word">Haran</span>. <span class="accented">Charran</span> in A.V. marks the difference between <span class="accented">Haran</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>), Lot's father, and the name of the place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). It is called "the city of Nahor" (<a href="/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> compared with Genesis 47:43). It still exists as an Arab village, with the name of Harran (see 'Dictionary of Bible'). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Brethren<p>Addressing the audience generally.<p>Fathers<p>Addressing the members of the Sanhedrim.<p>Of glory<p>Outward, visible glory, as in the shekinah and the pillar of fire.<p>Appeared (&#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>See on <a href="/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>. </body></html>
