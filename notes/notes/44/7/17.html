The words, being a Hebraism, are only an emphatical expression, to denote Moses’s extraordinary beauty, and might be not unfitly rendered <span class="ital">divinely beautiful, </span>the name of God being often introduced to express such things as were extraordinary in their kind. So in the Hebrew, what we translate <span class="ital">great wrestlings, </span>(<a href="/genesis/30-8.htm" title="And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.">Genesis 30:8</a>,) is <span class="ital">wrestlings of God; goodly cedars, </span>(<a href="/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>,) are <span class="ital">cedars of God; great mountains, </span>(<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>,) are <span class="ital">mountains of God. </span>This then agrees with what is said of Moses, (<a href="/exodus/2-2.htm" title="And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.">Exodus 2:2</a>,) that he was a <span class="ital">goodly child; </span>and with the account which Josephus gives of him, who says, “that when he was but three years old, his extraordinary beauty was such, that it struck every one that saw him; and as they carried him about, persons would leave their work to look at him.” See Grotius and Whitby. <span class="ital">And when he was cast out </span>— Was thus exposed to perish, the providence of God so ordered it, that <span class="ital">Pharaoh’s daughter took him up </span>— Being moved with pity at the sight of him; <span class="ital">and nourished him — </span>With a purpose of adopting him; <span class="ital">for her own son — </span>By which means, being designed for a kingdom, he had all those advantages of education, which he could not have had if he had not been exposed. “All these extraordinary circumstances, relating to the birth, preservation, education, genius, and character of Moses, serve to aggravate the crime of Israel in rejecting him, when he offered himself to them as a deliverer under so many advantages, and when Providence had so wonderfully interested itself in his favour.” — Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:17-29 Let us not be discouraged at the slowness of the fulfilling of God's promises. Suffering times often are growing times with the church. God is preparing for his people's deliverance, when their day is darkest, and their distress deepest. Moses was exceeding fair, fair toward God; it is the beauty of holiness which is in God's sight of great price. He was wonderfully preserved in his infancy; for God will take special care of those of whom he designs to make special use. And did he thus protect the child Moses? Much more will he secure the interests of his holy child Jesus, from the enemies who are gathered together against him. They persecuted Stephen for disputing in defence of Christ and his gospel: in opposition to these they set up Moses and his law. They may understand, if they do not wilfully shut their eyes against the light, that God will, by this Jesus, deliver them out of a worse slavery than that of Egypt. Although men prolong their own miseries, yet the Lord will take care of his servants, and effect his own designs of mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The time of the promise - The time of the "fulfillment" of the promise.<p>The people grew ... - <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7-9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.
