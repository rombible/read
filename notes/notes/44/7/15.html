<span class="ital">and our fathers </span>— The patriarch’s children also ended their lives in the same country; <span class="ital">and were carried over into Sychem </span>— That is, as Jacob was immediately carried, with solemn funeral pomp and procession, to be buried in the cave of Machpelah, with Abraham and Isaac, (<a href="/genesis/50-13.htm" title="For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.">Genesis 50:13</a>,) so the patriarchs also, having been embalmed, and put into coffins, in Egypt, (<a href="/genesis/50-26.htm" title="So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.">Genesis 50:26</a>,) were, at the return of Israel from thence, <span class="ital">carried over to Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre </span>— Made in that field which Jacob bequeathed to Joseph, as a peculiar legacy;

It seems that St. Stephen, rapidly running over so many circumstances of history, had not leisure (nor was it needful, where they were so well known) to recite them all distinctly. Therefore he here contracts into one two different sepulchres, places, and purchases, so as, in the former history, to name the buyer, omitting the seller; in the latter, to name the seller, omitting the buyer. Abraham bought a burying-place of the children of Heth, Genesis 23. There Jacob was buried. Jacob bought a field of the children of Hamor. There Joseph was buried. You see here how St. Stephen contracts these two purchases into one. This concise manner of speaking, strange as it seems to us, was common among the Hebrews: particularly when, in a case notoriously known, the speaker mentioned but part of the story, and left the rest, which would have interrupted the current of his discourse, to be supplied in the mind of the hearer. <span class="ital">And laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought — </span>The first land which these strangers bought was for a sepulchre. They sought for a country in heaven. Perhaps the whole sentence might be rendered thus: <span class="ital">So Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over into Shechem, and laid by the sons </span>[that is, descendants] <span class="ital">of Hamor, the father of Shechem, in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money. </span>So Bengelius and Wesley. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values himself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And died - <a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>.<p>He and our fathers - The time which the Israelites remained in Egypt was 215 years, so that all the sons of Jacob were deceased before the Jews went out to go to the land of Canaan.<p>And were carried over - Jacob himself was buried in the field of Macpelah by Joseph and his brethren, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, 13. It is expressly said that the bones of Joseph were carried by the Israelites when they went into the land of Canaan, and buried in Shechem, <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>; compare <a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>. No mention is made in the Old Testament of their carrying the bones of any of the other patriarchs, but the thing is highly probable in itself. If the descendants of Joseph carried his bones, it would naturally occur to them to take also the bones of each of the patriarchs, and give them an honorable sepulchre together in the land of promise. Josephus (Antiq., book 2, chapter 8, section 2) says that "the posterity and sons of these men (of the brethren of Joseph), after some time, carried their bodies and buried them in Hebron; but as to the bones of Joseph, they carried them into the land of Canaan afterward, when the Hebrews went out of Egypt." This is in accordance with the common opinion of the Jewish writers, that they were buried in Hebron. Yet the tradition is not uniform. Some of the Jews affirm that they were buried in Sychem (Kuinoel). As the Scriptures do not anywhere deny that the patriarchs were buried in Sychem, it cannot be proved that Stephen was in error. There is one circumstance of strong probability to show that he was correct. At the time when this defense was delivered, "Sychem" was in the hands of the Samaritans, between whom and the Jews there was a violent hostility. Of course, the Jews would not be willing to concede that the Samaritans had the bones of their ancestors, and hence, perhaps the opinion had been maintained that they were buried in Hebron.<p>Into Sychem - This was a town or village near to Samaria. It was called Sichar (see the notes on <a href="/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>), "Shechem," and "Sychem." It is now called "Naplous" or "Napolose," and is ten miles from Shiloh, and about forty from Jerusalem, toward the north.<p>That Abraham bought - The word "Abraham" here has given rise to considerable perplexity, and it is now pretty generally conceded that it is a mistake. It is certain, from <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, that this piece of land was bought, not by Abraham, but by "Jacob," of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. The land which "Abraham" purchased was the cave of Macpelah, of the sons of Heth, in Hebron, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>. Various solutions have been proposed of this difficulty, which it is not necessary to detail. It may be remarked, however:<p>(1) That as the text now stands, it is an evident error. This is clear from the passages cited from the Old Testament above.<p>(2) it is not at all probable that either Stephen or Luke would have committed such an error. Every consideration must lead us to the conclusion that they were too well acquainted with such prominent points of the Jewish history to commit an error like this.<p>(3) the "probability," therefore, is, that the error has arisen since; but how, is not known, nor is there any way of ascertaining. All the ancient versions agree in reading "Abraham." Only one manuscript reads "Abraham our father." Some have supposed, therefore, that it was written "which our father bought," and that some early transcriber inserted the name of Abraham. Others, that the name was omitted entirely by Stephen; and then the antecedent to the verb "bought" will be "Jacob," in verse 15, according with the fact. Other modes have been proposed also, but none are entirely satisfactory. If there was positive proof of Stephen's inspiration, or if it were necessary to make that out, the difficulty would be much greater. But it has already been remarked that there is no decisive evidence of that, and it is not necessary to make out that point to defend the Scriptures. All that can be demanded of the historian is, that he should give a fair account of the defense as it was delivered; and though the probability is that Stephen would not commit Such an error, yet, admitting that he did, it by no means proves that "Luke" was not inspired, or that Luke has committed any error in recording "what was actually said."<p>Of the sons of Emmor - In the Hebrew Gen 33:19, "the children of Hamor" - but different ways of rendering the same word. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. threescore and fifteen souls&#8212;according to the Septuagint version of Ge 46:27, which Stephen follows, including the five children and grandchildren of Joseph's two sons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which St. Stephen puts them in mind of the rather, that he might insinuate, no country, nor place, nor temple, were so necessary, but that (notwithstanding they had none of them) their forefathers did live and die in the fear and favour of God, although in Egypt, out of the Promised Land, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Jacob went down into Egypt,....

The frequent mention of Egypt may perhaps indicate that Stephen meant to emphasise the fact that there, far away from the land of promise, God’s Presence was with the chosen race (who were now all in a strange land) and His worship was observed.—<span class="greekheb">μετετέθησαν</span>: only here in this sense in N.T. Some have supposed that only <span class="greekheb">οἱ πατέρες</span> and not <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> is the subject; this would no doubt avoid the first difficulty of the verse, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that Jacob was buried in Shechem, whereas according to <a href="/genesis/50-13.htm" title="For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.">Genesis 50:13</a> he was laid to rest in the cave of Machpelah. But a further difficulty must be met. Joseph is the only son of the Patriarch who is expressly stated to have been buried in Shechem, <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>, and of the removal of the bodies from Egypt nothing is said. But the silence as to the latter fact need not trouble us, as whether we accept the tradition mentioned by Josephus or by St. Jerome, they both presuppose the removal of the bodies of the Patriarchs to the promised land, <span class="ital">cf.</span> the discussion on <a href="/exodus/13-19.htm" title="And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you.">Exodus 13:19</a>. <span class="ital">Mechilta</span> (Lumby, p. 164), Wetstein, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and see also the tradition in the <span class="ital">Book of Jubilees</span>, chap. xlvi., that the children carried up the bones of the sons of Jacob, and buried them in Machpelah, except those of Joseph. But another tradition is implied in <span class="ital">Sot.</span> 7 <span class="ital">b</span>. According to Josephus, who probably repeats a local tradition, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, ii., 8, 2, they were buried at Hebron. But according to St. Jerome their tombs were shown at Shechem, and the Rabbinical tradition mentioned by Wetstein and Lightfoot places their burial there, a statement supported by a Samaritan tradition existing to this day (<span class="ital">Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, December, 1877, see Felten and Plumptre, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). When we consider the prominent position of Shechem as compared with Hebron in the time of Joshua, there is nothing strange in the fact that the former place rather than Machpelah should have been chosen as the resting-place not only of Joseph but also of his brethren. Plumptre has ingeniously contended that St. Stephen might have followed the Samaritan tradition, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>, and see <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, vol. vii., first series: “The Samaritan element in the Gospels and Acts,” p. 21 ff., although we need not suppose that in this reference to the hated Samaritans Stephen proposed to show that not even they had been rejected by God. There is certainly no difficulty in supposing that here and elsewhere Stephen might easily have adopted some popular tradition, and at all events the fact that the mistake, if it is one, is left unnoticed by the historian is a plain proof of the truthfulness of the record. But a further difficulty. Abraham purchases the cave of Machpelah, but from Ephron the Hittite, <a href="/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>. The sons of Hamor sell a field, but to Jacob—a field at Shechem, <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>, <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>. How can we explain this with reference to the statement in the text? Shechem was the earliest settlement of Abraham when he entered Canaan, and there he built an altar, <a href="/context/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land....">Genesis 12:6-7</a>. But no devout Hebrew worshipper, with all his reverence for holy places, would be content to see the altar so consecrated belonging to others, and so exposed to desecration; the purchase of the ground on which an altar stood would therefore seem to follow as a kind of corollary from the erection of an altar on that ground. This is at all events a more satisfactory solution than omitting the word <span class="greekheb">Ἀβραάμ</span> or exchanging it for <span class="greekheb">Ἰακώβ</span> (see Hackett). Of course the reading of R.V., W.H[200] (as above), prevents a further difficulty as to the rendering of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Συχέμ</span> if the reading <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Συχέμ</span> is retained, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Wendt, critical note, p. 157 (edition 1899), who follows A.V. in supporting “the father of Sichem,” so Hackett, but see on the other hand Plumptre, <span class="ital">Acts, in loco</span>, and Felten, <span class="ital">in loco</span>. For the way in which the two purchases and the two burials may have been confused in popular tradition, see Zöckler, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 302, 2nd edit. (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Bengel, Stier, Nösgen).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[200] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">So Jacob went down into Egypt</span>] Now the whole race whom God had chosen to Himself was in Egypt, away from the land of promise, and remained there for a long period, yet God was with them in their exile, and His worship was preserved for the whole time.

Of the transportation of the bodies of the patriarchs to Canaan we have no record in Holy Writ. Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiq</span>. ii. 8. 2) says “the posterity and sons of these men, after some time, carried their bodies and buried them at Hebron.” In the discussion of <a href="/exodus/13-19.htm" title="And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you.">Exodus 13:19</a>, <span class="ital">Carry up my bones away hence with you</span>, it is said (<span class="ital">Mechilta</span>, ed.
