In spite of all that had been done before (<a href="/context/acts/27-18.htm" title="And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;">Acts 27:18-19</a>), the ship still needed to be lightened. The tense implies a process of some continuance. The “wheat” which they now cast out may have been part of the cargo which had been reserved by way of provisions. As it was clear that they could no longer continue in the ship, this was no longer required, and the one essential point was to keep her floating till they reached the shore.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:30-38 God, who appointed the end, that they should be saved, appointed the means, that they should be saved by the help of these shipmen. Duty is ours, events are God's; we do not trust God, but tempt him, when we say we put ourselves under his protection, if we do not use proper means, such as are within our power, for our safety. But how selfish are men in general, often even ready to seek their own safety by the destruction of others! Happy those who have such a one as Paul in their company, who not only had intercourse with Heaven, but was of an enlivening spirit to those about him. The sorrow of the world works death, while joy in God is life and peace in the greatest distresses and dangers. The comfort of God's promises can only be ours by believing dependence on him, to fulfil his word to us; and the salvation he reveals must be waited for in use of the means he appoints. If God has chosen us to salvation, he has also appointed that we shall obtain it by repentance, faith, prayer, and persevering obedience; it is fatal presumption to expect it in any other way. It is an encouragement to people to commit themselves to Christ as their Saviour, when those who invite them, clearly show that they do so themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They lightened the ship - By casting the wheat into the sea. As they had no hope of saving the cargo, and had no further use for it, they hoped that by throwing the wheat overboard the ship would draw less water, and that thus they would be able to run the vessel on the shore. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38-40. when they had eaten enough, &c.&#8212;With fresh strength after the meal, they make a third and last effort to lighten the ship, not only by pumping, as before, but by throwing the whole cargo of wheat into the sea (see on [2134]Ac 27:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Cast out the wheat, </span> the provision they had for their sustenance. This is the third time that they lightened the ship, being willing that all their goods should perish for them, rather than with them. Or these heathens were so far persuaded by St. Paul, that they ventured their lives upon the credit of what he had foretold them; and parted with their food, and all they had to live upon, only upon his word, that they should want them in the ship no more. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they had eaten enough,....

Now, seeing that for some time (and in quite a brief period must the fate of those on board be decided) further victuals were unnecessary—now they ventured on the last means of lightening the ship (which, with the decreasing depth, <a href="/acts/27-28.htm" title="And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.">Acts 27:28</a>, was urgently required for the purpose of driving it on to the land), and cast the provisions overboard, which, considering the multitude of men and the previous <span class="greekheb">ἀσιτία</span>, was certainly still a considerable weight. Chrysostom aptly remarks: <span class="greekheb">οὕτω λοιπὸν τὸ πᾶν ἔῤῥιψαν ἐπὶ τὸν Παῦλον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς καὶ τὸν σῖτον ἐκβαλεῖν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Σῖτος</span> may denote either <span class="ital">corn</span>, or also, as here and often with Greek writers, <span class="ital">provisions</span> particularly prepared from corn (meal, bread, etc.). Others (Erasmus, Luther, Beza, <span class="ital">et al.</span>, including Baumgarten, Smith, Hackett) have explained it as the <span class="ital">corn</span> with which, namely, the ship had been <span class="ital">freighted</span>. But against this it may be urged, first, that this <span class="ital">freighting</span> is not indicated; secondly, that <span class="greekheb">κορεσθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δὲ τροφῆς</span> corresponds to the throwing out of the <span class="ital">provisions</span>, and not of the <span class="ital">freight</span>; and thirdly, that the throwing out of the <span class="ital">freight</span> had already taken place, <a href="/acts/27-18.htm" title="And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;">Acts 27:18</a>, as this indeed was most natural, because the freight was the heaviest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/27.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/27-38.htm" title="And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.">Acts 27:38</a>. <span class="greekheb">κορεσθ</span>., <a href="/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1 Corinthians 4:8</a>, nowhere else in N.T., with genitive of the thing with which one is filled, as in classical Greek. Alford refers to LXX, <a href="/deuteronomy/31-20.htm" title="For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>, but see Hatch and Redpath, <span class="ital">sub v.</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἐκούφιζον</span>: <span class="ital">de nave</span>, Polyb., i., 60, 8; LXX, <a href="/jonah/1-5.htm" title="Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.">Jonah 1:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν σῖτον</span>: “the wheat,” A. and R.V., Vulgate, <span class="ital">triticum</span>; so Ramsay, Breusing, Vars, J.

Blass thinks that the word used is decisive in favour of this interpretation; otherwise we should have had <span class="greekheb">σιτία</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἄρτοι</span> if merely food had been meant; not only was the cargo of sufficient weight really to lighten the ship, but there was need for the ship being as clear as possible for the operations in <a href="/acts/27-40.htm" title="And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.">Acts 27:40</a>. Wendt 1899 appears also to favour this view, <span class="ital">cf.</span> his comments with those in 1888 edition, where he adopts the view of Meyer and Weiss, that the word means provisions of food, as at first sight the context seems to indicate. But the latter would not have made much appreciable difference in weight, nor would those on board have been likely to throw them away, since they could not tell on, what shore they might be cast, whether hospitable or not, or how long they would be dependent on the food which they had in the ship. In <a href="/acts/27-18.htm" title="And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;">Acts 27:18</a> the reference may be to the cargo on deck, or at all events only to a part of the cargo (Holtzmann).

So they set about lightening the ship. This is implied by the tense of the verb, and the next clause tells us the way they did it. They cast into the sea the corn which had been the first cargo of the vessel from Alexandria. No doubt this was the heaviest part of the freight, and would relieve the vessel greatly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/27.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/27-38.htm" title="And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.">Acts 27:38</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν σῖτον</span>, <span class="ital">the corn</span>) having a sure hope of getting to land.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Throwing out</span> for <span class="accented">and cast out</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They lightened the ship</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, only here in the New Testament; but it is the technical word for lightening a ship so as to keep her afloat.

There is a difference of opinion as to what St. Luke here means by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Meyer and others think it was merely "the ship's provision," and that, considering the number of persons in the ship, and the little consumption during the last fortnight, the weight of what was left would be considerable. They add that the cargo had been already thrown overboard in ver. 18. Others, as Howson, following Smith and Penroso, Farrar, Lewin, and many older commentators, with more reason, understand "the wheat" to mean the ship's cargo from Alexandria to Rome; they think it had been impossible to get at it while the ship was drifting; and that, even had it been possible, it was the last thing they would have recourse to. But now, when it was impossible to save the ship, and the only chance of saving their lives was to run her on the beach, it was an absolute necessity to lighten the ship as much as possible. They therefore cast her freight of Alexandrian corn into the sea, and waited for daylight (see note to ver. 18). </body></html>
