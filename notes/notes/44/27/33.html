Once again the practical insight of the Apostle—yet more, perhaps, his kindly human sympathy—comes prominently forward. Soldiers and sailors needed something that would draw them together after the incident just narrated. All were liable at once to the despair and the irritability caused by exhaustion.<p><span class= "bld">That ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">that ye continue on the look-out, without a meal, taking no extra food.</span> The English somewhat exaggerates the force of the Greek. The word for “fasting” is not that which is commonly used in the New Testament to express entire abstinence from food. It was physically impossible that the two hundred and seventy-six who were on board could have gone on for fourteen days without any food at all. Scanty rations had, we must believe, been doled out to those who came for them; but the tension of suspense was so great that they had not sat down to any regular meal. They had taken, as the last word implies, nothing beyond what was absolutely necessary to keep body and soul together. What they wanted physically was food, and morally, the sense of restored companionship; and to this St. Paul’s advice led them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/27-33.htm" title="And while the day was coming on, Paul sought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing....">Acts 27:33-38</a></span>. <span class="ital">While the day was coming on </span>— Before they had light sufficient to discern what they should do; <span class="ital">Paul besought them all to take meat — </span>To take some refreshment; <span class="ital">saying, This is the fourteenth day that ye continue fasting </span>— Not as if they had absolutely eaten nothing all that while; for it is generally allowed that none can fast half so long without danger of death; <span class="ital">having taken nothing </span>— No regular meal; through a deep sense of your extreme danger: the necessary consequence of which is, that you must be very faint and weak, and unfit for those exertions and fatigues which may farther lie before you; for it will be a narrow escape that we are to expect, and we may find great difficulties in getting on shore. If a sense of the great danger they were in took away all their desire for food, let us not wonder if men who have a deep sense of the danger they are in of everlasting death should, for a time, forget either to take food, or to attend to their worldly affairs. Much less let us censure that as madness which may be the beginning of true wisdom. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— Since till the morning rises we can attempt nothing by way of approach to land; <span class="ital">I pray </span>— <span class="greekheb">Παρακαλω</span>, <span class="ital">I exhort; you to take </span><span class="greekheb">τροφης</span>, <span class="ital">nourishment, for this is </span>— <span class="greekheb">Προς της υμετερας σωτηριας</span>, <span class="ital">for your preservation, </span>that ye may be the better able to swim to shore; <span class="ital">for there shall not a hair, </span>&c. — A proverbial expression, assuring them of entire safety. <span class="ital">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread and gave thanks </span>— For that provision which God now gave them in their necessities, and for the assurance of life with which he had favoured them by so particular a revelation; <span class="ital">and when he had broken it, he began to eat </span>— Thus setting them an example. <span class="ital">Then were they all of good cheer — </span>Encouraged by his example as well as words; <span class="ital">and they also took some meat </span>— As he had done. <span class="ital">And when they had eaten enough </span>— As much as was sufficient for their present refreshment and support; <span class="ital">they lightened the ship </span>— Still more than they had done; <span class="ital">and cast out the wheat </span>— The very stores they had on board; <span class="ital">into the sea </span>— So firmly did they now depend on what Paul had said. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:30-38 God, who appointed the end, that they should be saved, appointed the means, that they should be saved by the help of these shipmen. Duty is ours, events are God's; we do not trust God, but tempt him, when we say we put ourselves under his protection, if we do not use proper means, such as are within our power, for our safety. But how selfish are men in general, often even ready to seek their own safety by the destruction of others! Happy those who have such a one as Paul in their company, who not only had intercourse with Heaven, but was of an enlivening spirit to those about him. The sorrow of the world works death, while joy in God is life and peace in the greatest distresses and dangers. The comfort of God's promises can only be ours by believing dependence on him, to fulfil his word to us; and the salvation he reveals must be waited for in use of the means he appoints. If God has chosen us to salvation, he has also appointed that we shall obtain it by repentance, faith, prayer, and persevering obedience; it is fatal presumption to expect it in any other way. It is an encouragement to people to commit themselves to Christ as their Saviour, when those who invite them, clearly show that they do so themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And while the day was coming on - At daybreak.

The word "meat" was formerly used to denote "food" of any kind.<p>That ye have tarried - That you have remained or been fasting.<p>Having taken nothing - No regular meal. It cannot mean that they had lived entirely without food, but that they had been in so much danger, were so constantly engaged, and had been so anxious about their safety, that they had taken no regular meal, or that what they had taken had been at irregular intervals, and had been a scanty allowance. "Appian speaks of an army which for 20 days together had neither food nor sleep; by which he must mean that they neither made full meals nor slept whole nights together. The same interpretation must be given to this phrase" (Doddridge).

Here again we may notice how every means was to be employed for safety. Paul urges them to take now a proper meal that when the time for work arrives they may be in a condition to undertake it. The remaining clauses of the verse are not to be understood as implying that the fast had been entire for so long a time. Such a thing is impossible.
