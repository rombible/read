But the latter writer adds that the <span class="greekheb">περιπ</span>. does not imply want of purpose, as <span class="greekheb">ἐπώκειλαν</span> shows, and the meaning is that while at anchor they could not see the exact character of the spot (see also C. and H.), but as they approached they found that they had lighted on the channel not more than a hundred yards in breadth between the island of Salmonetta and the mainland; this might very properly be called “a place where two seas meet,” A. and R.V., as it formed a communication between the sea within the bay and the sea outside. The adjective <span class="greekheb">διθ</span>. is as applicable to <span class="ital">water</span> uniting two seas, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the Bosphorus, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Strabo, ii., 5, 12 (quoted by Smith), as to <span class="ital">land</span> like the Isthmus of Corinth; see J.

Breusing, p. 204, Goerne, Wendt (1899) take it of St. Paul’s Bank which lies just in front of St. Paul’s Bay, so too Vars, p; 258, for the same view and its support.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπώκειλαν τὴν ναῦν</span>: “they ran the vessel aground” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> J.

In Homer, <span class="ital">Odys.</span>, ix., 148, however, we have <span class="greekheb">νῆας</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπικέλσαι</span>, and 546, <span class="greekheb">νῆα ἐκέλσαμεν</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="ital">adpcllere navem</span>). Blass, <span class="ital">Philology of the Gospels</span>, p. 186, sees in this sudden introduction of the phrase <span class="greekheb">ἐπώκειλαν τὴν ναῦν</span> an indication that St. Luke had read his Homer, since in no other passage in the N.T. do we find the obsolete word <span class="greekheb">ἡ ναῦς</span>, the commoner expression <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλοῖον</span> occurring in this chapter no less than thirteen times. R.V. renders <span class="greekheb">τὴν ναῦν</span> “the vessel.” all other E.V[423] “the ship,” and it has been thought that the word is so changed here because that which had hitherto been a <span class="greekheb">πλοῖον</span> capable of sailing was now reduced to a mere hulk (Wordsworth, Humphry).—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ μὲν πρώρα ἐρείσασα</span>: “and the prow struck,” R.V., Ramsay, this is accounted for by the peculiar nature of the bottom in St. Paul’s Bay, see J.

Read “But lighting upon a place, &c.” This is one of the features of the narrative by which the locality can almost certainly be identified. The little island of Salmonetta forms with the Maltese coast near St Paul’s Bay exactly such a position as is here described. From the sea at a little distance, it appears as though the land were all continuous, and the current between the island and the mainland is only discovered on a nearer approach. This current by its deposits has raised a mud-bank where its force is broken by the opposing sea, and into this bank, just at the place where the current meets the sea-waves, was the ship driven, the force of the water preventing the vessel from reaching the beach just beyond. So it came to pass that though they got much nearer to the shore than at first, yet after all they had to swim for their lives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but the hinder part was broken</span>] Read (as <span class="ital">R. V.</span>) “the stern began to break up.” The verb in the orginal expresses an incomplete and gradual process. When the foreship was immoveable, the stern would also be held fast, and so be acted on by the waves with great violence and begin to go to pieces.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the violence of the waves</span>] The best MSS. do not represent the last three words.

The explanation of this "place where two seas met" is as follows: - As the ship stood at anchor in the bay on the north-east side of the island, it would have the Koura Point (<span class="accented">Ras el-Kaura</span>) on its left, and on entering deeper into the bay westward, the little island of Salmonetta, or Selmoon, otherwise called Gzeier, would lie on its right, and would appear to be part of the island of Malta, from which it is separated by a narrow channel about a hundred yards in width. When, however, she was just coming upon the beach for which she was making, she would come opposite to this open channel, and the sea from the north would break upon her and meet the sea on the south side of the island, where the ship was. Here, then, <span class="cmt_word">they ran the vessel aground</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, or, according to the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, is only found here in the Bible; but it is the regular word for running a ship aground, or ashore, in classical writers. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> has exactly the same meaning. The simple verbs <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> are also both in use for running a ship to land. <span class="cmt_word">The foreship struck</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, here only in the Bible, but very common in classical Greek. Its meaning here is not very different from its frequent medical meaning of a disease "fixing <span class="accented">itself"</span> and "settling" in some particular part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Remained unmovable</span>. "A ship impelled by the force of a gale into a creek with a bottom such as that laid down in Admiral Smyth's chart of St. Paul's Bay, would strike a bottom of mud graduating into tenacious clay, into which the forepart would fix itself and be held fast, whilst the stern was exposed to the force of the waves" (Smith, p. 144). Unmovable; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, only here and <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>, in the Bible; but common in Greek writers in the sense of "firm," "unmovable." <span class="cmt_word">Began to break up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, like <span class="accented">solvo</span> and <span class="accented">dissolvo</span> in Latin). The planks were loosened and disjoined. <span class="cmt_word">By the violence</span>. The R.T. omits the words <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and so has <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> alone, somewhat like <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 21. </body></html>
