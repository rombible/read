Thus God, for Paul’s sake, not only saved all the rest of the ship’s company from being lost in the sea, but preserved the prisoners from being murdered, according to the unjust and barbarous proposal of the soldiers, who could have thought of no worse a scheme, had they all been condemned malefactors, and had these guards, instead of conveying them to their trial, been carrying them to the place of execution. <span class="ital">Commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land </span>— That they might be helpful to others in getting on shore; <span class="ital">and the rest, some on boards, </span>&c. — Still using means, though it was of God only that they had those means, and that the means were made effectual for their preservation. <span class="ital">And it came to pass </span>— Through the singular care of Divine Providence, and according to the prediction of Paul; <span class="ital">that they escaped all safe to land </span>— And there was not one single life lost; and some of them, doubtless, received the apostle as a teacher sent from God.

Thus, if the heart fixes in the world in affection, and cleaving to it, it is lost. Satan's temptations beat against it, and it is gone; but as long as it keeps above the world, though tossed with cares and tumults, there is hope for it. They had the shore in view, yet suffered shipwreck in the harbour; thus we are taught never to be secure. Though there is great difficulty in the way of the promised salvation, it shall, without fail, be brought to pass. It will come to pass that whatever the trials and dangers may be, in due time all believers will get safely to heaven. Lord Jesus, thou hast assured us that none of thine shall perish. Thou wilt bring them all safe to the heavenly shore. And what a pleasing landing will that be! Thou wilt present them to thy Father, and give thy Holy Spirit full possession of them for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the soldiers' counsel ... - Why they gave this advice is not known. It was probably, however, because the Roman military discipline was very strict, and if they escaped it would be charged on them that it had been done by the negligence and unfaithfulness of the soldiers. They therefore proposed to kill them, though contrary to all humanity, justice, and laws; presuming, probably, that it would be supposed that they had perished in the wreck. This is a remarkable proof that people can be cruel even when experiencing the tender mercy of God, and that the most affecting scenes of divine goodness will not mitigate the natural ferocity and cruelty of those who delight in blood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42-44. the soldiers' counsel was to hill the prisoners, lest any &#8230; should escape&#8212;Roman cruelty, which made the keepers answerable for their prisoners with their own lives, is here reflected in this cruel proposal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This speaks their great ingratitude, that they would take away Paul’s life, who had preserved theirs.

Now, when the loss of the ship was just as certain, as with the proximity of the land the escape of those prisoners who could swim was easily possible, the soldiers were of a mind to kill them; but the centurion was too much attached to Paul to permit it.[175] Not sharing in the apprehension of his soldiers, he commanded that all in the ship who knew how to swim should swim to land, and then the rest (to whom in this way assistance was ready on shore) were to follow partly on planks and partly on broken pieces of the ship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">βουλὴ ἐγένετο</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>,] <span class="ital">there took place a project</span> (in the design), <span class="ital">that</span>, etc.; comp. on <a href="/acts/27-1.htm" title="And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.">Acts 27:1</a>, and see Nägelsb. <span class="ital">on the Iliad</span>, p. 62, ed. 3, who on such modes of expression appropriately remarks that “the will is conceived as a <span class="ital">striving</span> will.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀποῤῥίπτειν</span>, <span class="ital">to cast down</span>, intransitive, in the sense of <span class="ital">se projicere</span>.
