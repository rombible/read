To the heathen soldiers and sailors it was probably altogether new, and at such a moment must have been singularly impressive. The act of “breaking bread,” though in itself not more than the natural incident of such a meal, must at least have reminded the few Christians who were his companions of the more solemn “breaking of bread” with which they were familiar. (See Note on <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>.)

Duty is ours, events are God's; we do not trust God, but tempt him, when we say we put ourselves under his protection, if we do not use proper means, such as are within our power, for our safety. But how selfish are men in general, often even ready to seek their own safety by the destruction of others! Happy those who have such a one as Paul in their company, who not only had intercourse with Heaven, but was of an enlivening spirit to those about him. The sorrow of the world works death, while joy in God is life and peace in the greatest distresses and dangers. The comfort of God's promises can only be ours by believing dependence on him, to fulfil his word to us; and the salvation he reveals must be waited for in use of the means he appoints. If God has chosen us to salvation, he has also appointed that we shall obtain it by repentance, faith, prayer, and persevering obedience; it is fatal presumption to expect it in any other way. It is an encouragement to people to commit themselves to Christ as their Saviour, when those who invite them, clearly show that they do so themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And gave thanks ... - This was the usual custom among the Hebrews.

The words are sometimes taken to mean that Paul simply encourages them by his own example to eat. But Blass, see critical note, who comments “et oratione confirmat et exemplo,” adds in [419] text <span class="greekheb">ἐπιδιδοὺς καὶ ἡμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to Luke and Aristarchus, in which he sees a distinct reference to the <span class="ital">cœna sacra</span> (so Belser). But quite apart from this reading in [420] the peculiar language of St. Luke seems to intimate such a reference. Olshausen and Ewald (so Plumptre) take the words to refer to the <span class="ital">Agape</span>, whilst Meyer (so Hackett) sees a reference to the act of the Jewish house-father amidst his household; but Wendt simply refers it to the act of a pious Jew or Christian giving thanks before eating a meal and sharing it, so Zöckler. Bethge, more specifically, sees in the act a thanksgiving of a Christian to God the Father, an instance of what St. Paul himself recommends, <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm" title="Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;">Ephesians 5:20</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>, and both Felten and Knabenbauer apparently prefer to interpret the words as marking Paul’s reverence towards God before the Gentiles around him. Breusing shows, p. 196, that <span class="greekheb">ἄρτος</span> might = <span class="ital">panis nauticus</span>, but in the passage which he quotes from Lucian we have <span class="greekheb">ἄρτους ναυτικούς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[419] R(omana), in Blass, a first rough copy of St. Luke.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[420] R(omana), in Blass, a first rough copy of St. Luke.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35</span>. <span class="ital">gave thanks to God</span>] As he had advised, so he set the example of taking food. But he did more than this. He made an Eucharist of this meal. In the sight of the heathen soldiers and sailors, he brake the bread in solemn thanksgiving, and thus converted the whole into a religions act, which can hardly have been without its influence on the minds of some, at all events, of those who had heard St Paul’s previous words about the revelation which God had made to him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/27.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/27-35.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.">Acts 27:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὐχαρίστησε</span>, <span class="ital">he gave thanks</span>) A public confession of the Lord.—<span class="greekheb">ἤρξατο</span>, <span class="ital">he began</span>) There was the force of example even in this.

But there is the same similarity of phrase (except that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is used for <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> in the first passage) in <a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a> and Matthew 15:36, and therefore the conclusion to be drawn is that St. Paul's action and words were the same as those of our Lord, as far as the breaking bread and giving thanks and eating, went, which were common to both occasions; but in the institution of the sacrament the words "This is my body" were additional, and represented an additional and sacramental truth. Observe, again, the devout confession of the living God in the presence of unbelieving men (vers. 23, 24). </body></html>
