So Josephus (<span class= "ital">Life, </span>c. 3), narrating his shipwreck, just two years after St. Paul’s, on his voyage from Judæa to Puteoli, states that he was picked up by another ship sailing from Cyrene to the same port, “in the middle of Adria.” The intersection of the lines of the two vessels would fall, as a glance at the map will show, within the region now mentioned by St. Luke under the same name.<p><span class= "bld">The shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">they suspected, </span>or <span class= "ital">surmised, that a certain country was approaching them.</span> The sound of breakers, probably the white lines of foam seen through the darkness, gave rise, we may believe, to this impression. The country which they were nearing could hardly be any other than the head-land known as the Point of Koura, at the east extremity of St. Paul’s, Bay, in Malta. To the Apostle the sight and the sound would alike witness that his prediction was on the point of fulfilment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/27-27.htm" title="But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;...">Acts 27:27-32</a></span>. <span class="ital">But when the fourteenth night — </span>Since they left Crete; <span class="ital">was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria </span>— That is, in the Adriatic sea: as the ancients called all that part of the Mediterranean sea which lay south of Italy. <span class="ital">About midnight, the shipmen deemed </span>(apprehended) <span class="ital">that they drew near to some country </span>— Or <span class="ital">shore; </span>which confirmed what Paul had told them, that they must be driven upon some island: and, to try whether it was so or not, they <span class="ital">sounded </span>— In order to ascertain the depth of the water, which would be less as they drew nearer to the shore. And by the first experiment, they <span class="ital">found it twenty fathoms, </span>and by the next only <span class="ital">fifteen </span>— Which decrease of their sounding convinced them that their apprehension was just. <span class="ital">Then, fearing lest they should have fallen upon rocks </span>— Of which there were very many in those seas, especially about the islands, where there might not be depth of water sufficient to keep the vessel from striking; <span class="ital">they cast four anchors out of the stern — </span>This shows how great the tempest was, in that they needed so many anchors; <span class="ital">and wished for day — </span>That they might the better discern their situation. <span class="ital">And, as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship </span>— Perceiving the danger to be extreme, and endeavouring to provide for their own safety, by making to the shore; and <span class="ital">when </span>— To compass their design; <span class="ital">they let down the boat into the sea </span>— Supposing it would go more safely over the shallows; and were just going into it, <span class="ital">under colour as though they would have cast anchors </span>— From the ship’s head, to make the vessel more secure; thus dissembling the true reason of their going into the boat, which was to make their escape. <span class="ital">Paul </span>— Who knew it was the will of God that all proper endeavours should be used for their preservation, in a dependance on the promise he had given them, perceiving the design they had in view; <span class="ital">said to the centurion and to the soldiers </span>— Who had power to hinder their accomplishing their design; <span class="ital">Except these </span>mariners <span class="ital">abide in the ship </span>— Without whom ye know not how to manage it; <span class="ital">ye cannot be saved </span>— He does not say, <span class="ital">We. </span>That they would not have regarded. The soldiers were not careful for the lives of the prisoners: nor was Paul careful for his own. We may learn hence, to use the most proper means for security and success, even while we depend on Divine Providence, and wait for the accomplishment of God’s own promise. He never designed any promise should encourage rational creatures to act in an irrational manner; or to remain inactive, when he has given them natural capacities of doing something, at least, for their own benefit. To expect the accomplishment of any promise without exerting these, is at best vain and dangerous presumption, if all pretence of relying upon it be not profane hypocrisy. <span class="ital">Then the soldiers </span>— Who had learned from their commander to pay a deference to what Paul said, that the success of this intended fraud might be effectually prevented; <span class="ital">cut off the ropes of the boat </span>— By which it was fastened to the side of the ship; <span class="ital">and let it fall off into the sea </span>— Before any of the mariners got into it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:21-29 They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of their danger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bring themselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are well off; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition, often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made of relation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to his people, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to the faithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lord has any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was comforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interest in his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing are not two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that, and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fourteenth night - From the time when the tempest commenced.<p>In Adria - In the Adriatic Sea.

From their setting out from the Fair Havens in Crete, or from the beginning of the storm: <p>as they were driven up and down in Adria: or "in the Adriatic sea", as the Syriac version renders it: the Adriatic sea is now called by the Turks the gulf of Venice, and the straits of Venice, and sometimes the Venetian sea (i); but formerly the Adriatic sea included more than the Venetian gulf; it took in the Ionian and Sicilian seas, and had its name from the city Adria, a colony of the Tuscans (k). It is called by Ptolomy (l) Hadria, and reckoned a city of the Picenes. Pliny (m) places it near the river Padus, and calls it Atriae, a town of the Tuscans, which had a famous port, from whence the sea was before called Atriatic, which is now Adriatic. Adria, Justin (n) says, which is near to the Illyrian sea, and gave name to the Adriatic sea, is a Grecian city; and from this place the ancestors of Adrian, the Roman emperor, originally came; and all the sea between Illyricum and Italy is called the Adriatic; and from the beginning of it, which is at the city of Venice, unto Garganus, a mountain in Italy, and Dyrrachium, a city of Macedonia, it is 600 miles in length, and its largest breadth is 200, and the least 150, and the mouth of it 60. The other part of the sea, which washes Macedonia and Epirus, is called the Ionian sea. Moreover, this whole sea is called the superior sea, with respect to the Tyrrhenian, which dashes the other shore of Italy, and is called the inferior (o). In this same sea, Josephus (p), the historian, was shipwrecked as he was on a voyage to Rome: his account is this; <p>"I came to Rome, having gone through many dangers by sea, for our ship being sunk in the middle of Adria, being in number about six hundred, we swam all night; and about break of day, by the providence of God, a ship of Cyrene appeared to us, in which I, and some others, in all eighty, getting before the rest, were received into it, and so got safe to Dicearchia, which the Italians call Puteoli;'' <p>a place afterwards mentioned, where the apostle also arrived. And the sea itself is often, by the poets (q) called Adria, as here, and is represented as a very troublesome sea; and here Paul, and the ship's company, were driven to and fro by the storm, <p>when about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country: about the middle of the night the mariners thought, by some observations they made, that they were nigh land; or, as it is in the Greek text, "that some country drew near to them"; which well agrees with the language and sense of seafaring persons, to whose sight the land seems to draw near them, or depart from them, when they draw near, or depart from that: the Ethiopic version is, "they thought they should have seen a city"; they had a notion of some city near; and the Arabic version, "they thought to know in what country, or place" they were; and therefore did as follows. <p>(i) Hyde not. in Peritzol.

For Mommsen’s objection to the term here see above, Introd., p. 8. The passage in Strabo, ii., 123 (<span class="ital">cf.</span> vii. 187), where the Ionian sea is spoken of as a part of what is now called Adria plainly justifies a wider use of the term in St. Paul’s day than had been originally attached to it, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Ptolemy, <span class="ital">Geogr</span>, iii., 4, 14, 15, 16, who applies it to the sea extending from Sicily to Crete, and thus represents, although living some sixty or seventy years after him, what was no doubt the current usage in St. Luke’s day; so J.

As regards the use of term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the Adriatic, it is used in two ways: sometimes strictly of the Gulf of Venice, the Adriatic; sometimes, chiefly in latter writers, in a much wider sense, of the whole sea between Greece and Italy, including Sicily. This last is its use here. So, too, Josephus says that he was wrecked <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, in the midst of the Adriatic, on his voyage from Caesarea to Puteoli, and was picked up by a ship from Cyrene. This implies that he used the word "<span class="accented">Adria"</span> in the same sense as St. Luke does (see further the appendix 5. and 6. in Smith's 'Voyage,' etc.; Conybeare and Howson, p. 343, note, and p. 350; Lewin, vol. 2. p. 198, note; Farrar, vol. 2. p. 377, note; Renan, ' St. Paul,' p. 552). <span class="cmt_word">Surmised that they were drawing near</span>.
