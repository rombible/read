It was more than a conjecture, and the “must” was emphasised as by a prophetic insight into the future.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:21-29 They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of their danger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bring themselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are well off; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition, often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made of relation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to his people, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to the faithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lord has any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was comforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interest in his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing are not two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that, and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Howbeit - Nevertheless.<p>Upon a certain island - Malta.

"When the cheerless day came he gathered the sailors (and passengers) around him on the deck of the laboring vessel, and raising his voice above the storm" [Howson], reported the divine communication he had received; adding with a noble simplicity, "for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me," and encouraging all on board to "be of good cheer" in the same confidence. What a contrast to this is the speech of C&aelig;sar in similar circumstances to his pilot, bidding him keep up his spirit because he carried C&aelig;sar and C&aelig;sar's fortune! [Plutarch]. The Roman general knew no better name for the Divine Providence, by which he had been so often preserved, than C&aelig;sar's fortune [Humphry]. From the explicit particulars&#8212;that the ship would be lost, but not one that sailed in it, and that they "must be cast on a certain island"&#8212;one would conclude a visional representation of a total wreck, a mass of human beings struggling with the angry elements, and one and all of those whose figures and countenances had daily met his eye on deck, standing on some unknown island shore. From what follows, it would seem that Paul from this time was regarded with a deference akin to awe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This was given by Paul as a sign unto them of the truth of what he had said, which, when it came to pass, might induce them to believe the rest; which probably it did, and saved Paul from being killed by the soldiers, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/27-42.htm" title="And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.">Acts 27:42</a></span>.
