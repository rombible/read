Three different explanations have been given of the term translated “Augustus.” (1) The cohort may have consisted of soldiers levied in Sebaste (= Augusta) or Samaria. Josephus mentions a squadron of Sebastene cavalry (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 6, § 1; xix. 9, § 2), and there may have been a corresponding band of foot-soldiers. (2) Nero about this time had formed a kind of body-guard, consisting of some 3, 000 young men of the equestrian order, who accompanied him to games and spectacles, and whose chief business it was to applaud him in his speeches and recitations. To these he gave the name of <span class= "ital">Augustani</span> (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xiv. 15; Sueton. <span class= "ital">Nero, </span>c. 25), a term of which Sebastene would be the natural Greek equivalent. (3) A certain Julius Priscus appears in Tacit. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 92 as appointed by Vitellius to be one of the prefects of the Prætorian cohorts, which, as specially under the emperor’s personal command, might naturally be called by his name; and he has been conjecturally identified with the centurion here named. Of these, (2) seems the most probable, but it is not absolutely incompatible with (3). On this assumption, as it is not said that the cohort itself was at Cæsarea, it is possible that he may have accompanied Festus as an escort to his province, and was now returning to Rome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/27-1.htm" title="And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band....">Acts 27:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">When it was determined that we should sail into Italy </span>— The apostle having, by appeal, transferred his cause to the emperor, Festus determined to send him to Italy by sea, as being a shorter and less expensive passage to Rome; and for that purpose delivered him, with certain other persons, who were also to be judged at Rome, to one Julius, a centurion of the Italian legion. All these prisoners, with the soldiers who guarded them, went aboard a ship of Adramyttium, a seaport of Mysia, and sailed from Cesarea in the autumn of A.D. 62. From the history here, it appears that the messengers of the churches, who accompanied Paul into Judea with the collections, (<a href="/acts/21-4.htm" title="And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:4</a>,) were not intimidated by the evils which the Jewish rage brought upon him in Jerusalem. For, while he continued there, they remained with him; and when he was sent a prisoner to Cesarea, they followed him thither, and in both places, doubtless, ministered to him, and perhaps attended him on his trials. And when it was determined to send him to Italy, two at least of these affectionate friends went in the same ship with him; namely, Luke, the writer of this book, as appears from his style here, and Aristarchus, a Thessalonian.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when it was determined - By Festus <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/25-12.htm">Acts 25:12</a>, and when the time was come when it was convenient to send him.<p>That we should sail - The use of the term "we" here shows that the author of this book, Luke, was with Paul. He had been his traveling companion, and though he had not been accused, yet it was resolved that he should still accompany him. Whether he went at his own expense, or whether he was sent at the expense of the Roman government, does not appear. There is a difference of reading here in the ancient versions. The Syriac reads it, "And thus Festus determined that he (Paul) should be sent to Caesar in Italy," etc. The Latin Vulgate and the Arabic also read "he" instead of "we." But the Greek manuscripts are uniform, and the correct reading is doubtless what is in our version.<p>Into Italy - The country still bearing the same name, of which Rome was the capital.<p>And certain other prisoners - Who were probably also sent to Rome for a trial before the emperor.

This was called "Augustus' band" in honor of the Roman emperor Augustus (see the notes on <a href="/acts/25-21.htm">Acts 25:21</a>), and was probably distinguished in some way for the care in enlisting or selecting them.

But see further Ramsay, p. 323.

It is suggested that the term is here used is a popular colloquial way by St. Luke, and that it is not a translation of a correct Roman name, but rather “the troops of the emperor,” denoting a body of legionary centurions who were employed by the emperor on confidential business between the provinces and the imperial city, the title Augustan being conferred on them as a mark of favour and distinction. If this is so we gather from this notice in <span class="ital">Acts</span> a fact which is quite in accordance with what is known from other sources, although nowhere precisely attested. But can any connection be established between such a body and any branch of the imperial service which is actually known to us? There were certain legionary centurions who went by the name of <span class="ital">frumentarii</span>, who were employed not only, as their name implied, on duties connected with the commissariat, but also with the custody of prisoners and for purposes of police. In <a href="/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>, A.V. and R.V. margin, we have the remarkable reading: “and the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the [prætorian] guard” (see on <span class="ital">l.c.</span>). But it is urged that we cannot understand by this expression the Prefect of the Prætorian Guard, who would not be concerned with the comparatively humble duty of receiving and guarding prisoners. But in the Old L.V, called Gigas (unfortunately the only representative of the Old Latin for this passage) we have for a translation of the Greek <span class="greekheb">στρατοπεδάρχης</span>, in itself a very rare word, <span class="ital">princeps peregrinorum</span>. Now the legionary centurions who formed the <span class="ital">frumentarii</span> were regarded in Rome as being on detached duty, and were known as <span class="ital">peregrini;</span> on the Cælian Hill they occupied the camp known as the <span class="ital">castra peregrinorum</span>, and their commander bore the name of <span class="ital">princeps peregrinorum</span>. If therefore we may identify the Stratopedarch in <a href="/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a> with this commanding officer, we may also infer that Julius was one of the <span class="ital">Peregrini</span>, and that he hands over his prisoners to his superior officer, Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, pp. 315, 347, Mommsen, <span class="ital">Sitzungsberichte d. Berl. Akad.</span>, 1895, p. 495 ff., Rendall, <span class="ital">Acts</span>, p. 340. But see on the other hand Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., p. 389 (1897), Knabenbauer, <span class="ital">Actus Apostolorum</span>, p. 448, Belser, Beiträge, p. 147 ff., who point out amongst other reasons (1) that there is no clear evidence of the title <span class="ital">princeps peregrinorum</span> before the reorganisation of Sept. Severus, (2) that we have evidence that prisoners were sent from the provinces and committed to the care of the <span class="ital">præfectus prætorio, cf.</span> Traj., <span class="ital">Ad Plin.</span>, 57, with reference to one who had appealed: “vinctus mitti ad præfectos prætorii mei debet,” and other instances in Zahn, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, and Knabenbauer. See further for the value of the Old Latin reading in Gigas “Julius” (Headlam), Hastings’ B.D., and below on <a href="/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>. But whether we adopt the explanation suggested by Prof. Ramsay or not, it is still open to us to maintain that the title “Augustan” was a title of honour and not a local title; not connected with Sebaste the chief town of Samaria, or with Cæsar ea Sebaste. Schürer in answer to Mr. Headlam’s criticism (“Julius,” Hastings’ B.D.) is still of opinion, <span class="ital">Theol. Literaturzeitung</span>, 20, 1899, that reference is here made to one of the five cohorts of Cæsareans and Sebasteni mentioned by Josephus (for references see <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. i., vol. ii., p. 53, E.T., and Schmiedel, <span class="ital">Encyclop. Biblica</span>, i., 909, 1899), and therefore a <span class="greekheb">σπεῖρα Σεβαστηνῶν</span>; but he maintains that this same cohort was distinguished by the title Augusta from the other four cohorts, and that the writer of Acts is rendering this title in the word <span class="greekheb">Σεβαστή</span> (see also below). It is <span class="ital">possible</span> (as Wendt admits, although he prefers Schürer’s view, 1899) that Julius might have belonged to the <span class="ital">cohors Augusta, cf. C. I. L.</span>, iii., 66, 83, Augustiani, Suet., <span class="ital">Nero</span>, 25, Augustani, Tac., <span class="ital">Ann.</span>, xiv., 15, etc. (Belser, <span class="ital">Beiträge</span>, p. 154, Knabenbauer, p. 425), a select number of Roman knights who formed a kind of body-guard for the emperor, instituted about 59 A.D., and that he may have been in Cæsarea on some temporary special duty; but on the other hand see Page’s note, <span class="ital">in loco</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> note on <a href="/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a>). Grimm-Thayer, <span class="ital">sub v.</span> <span class="greekheb">Σεβαστός</span> (2), describes it as (an adj[407]) a title of honour given to certain legions, or cohorts, or battalions, for “valour”: “Ala Augusta ob virtutem appellata,” <span class="ital">C. I. L.</span>, vii., 340, 341, 344, but there is no inscriptional <span class="ital">proof</span> that this title was given to any Cæsarean cohort; see “Augustan Band” (Barnes), Hastings’ B.D., and Wendt can only refer to the bestowal of the title as “probable”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[407] adjective.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/27-1.htm" title="And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band....">Acts 27:1-44</a></span>.

But as Cæsarea was itself called “Sebaste” it seems more likely that the soldiers were Samaritan troop belonging to Cæsarea itself!

Its name "Augustan" was given, after the analogy of the Augustan legion, just as there was an "Italian band" as well as two or three "Italian legions." It has been conjectured (Kuinoel, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.), indeed, that the name may rather be taken flora Sebaste, Samaria, as consisting of Samaritans, seeing that Josephus ('Bell.
