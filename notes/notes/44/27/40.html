See the margin. The expression may mean that they slipped or cut their cables, and that thus they left the anchors in the sea. This is the most probable interpretation.<p>And loosed the rudder bands - The rudder, in navigation, is that by which a ship is steered. It is that part of the helm which consists of a piece of timber, broad at the bottom, which enters the water, and is attached by hinges to the stern-post on which it turns (Webster). But what was the precise form of the rudder among the ancients is not certainly known. Sometimes a vessel might be steered by oars. Most ships appear to have had a rudder at the prow as well as at the stern. In some instances, also, they had them on the sides. The word used here in the Greek is in the plural &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  to&#772;n pe&#772;dalion, and it is evident that they had in this ship more than one rudder. The bands mentioned here were probably the cords or fastenings by which the rudder could be made secure to the sides of the ship, or could be raised up out of the water in a violent storm, to prevent its being carried away. And as, in the tempest, the rudders had become useless <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/27-15.htm">Acts 27:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/27-17.htm">Acts 27:17</a>, they were probably either raised out of the water, or made fast. Now that the storm was past, and they could be used again, they were loosed, and they endeavored to direct the vessel into port.<p>The mainsail - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  artemo&#772;na. There have been various explanations of this word. Luther translates it as "the mast." Erasmus: "the yards." Grotius, who supposes that the mainmast had been cast away <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/27-17.htm">Acts 27:17</a>, thinks that this must mean "the foremast" or "the bowsprit." The word usually means the "mainsail." The Syriac and Arabic understand it of a "small sail," that was hoisted for a temporary purpose. Mr. Smith, in his work on this voyage of Paul, supposes that it was "the foresail." Others translate it "a jib." "The mainsail (foresail) being hoisted showed good judgment, though the distance was so small, as it would not only enable them to steer more correctly than without it, but would press the ship farther on upon the land, and thus enable them the more easily to get to the shore" (Penrose). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea&#8212;The Margin is here evidently right, "cut the anchors (away), they left them in the sea."<p>loosed the rudder bands&#8212;Ancient ships were steered by two large paddles, one on each quarter. When anchored by the stern in a gale, it would be necessary to lift them out of the water and secure them by lashings or rudder bands, and to loose these when the ship was again got under way [Smith].<p>hoised up the mainsail&#8212;her, "the foresail," the best possible sail that be set in the circumstances. How necessary must the crew have been to execute all these movements, and how obvious the foresight which made their stay indispensable to the safety of all on board (see on [2135]Ac 27:31)!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Loosed the rudder bands; </span> rudders is in the plural number put for the singular: or rather, in those times they having two rudders, (as by several passages amongst the ancients do appear), they were both loosed, that now they might use them to direct the ship to the best advantage in making the shore, they having been tied whilst they were adrift, or at anchor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hoised up the mainsail, </span> which they had let down, or struck, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/27-17.htm" title="Which when they had taken up, they used helps, under girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.">Acts 27:17</a></span>, and now, that they might make some use of the winds, to get nigher to the shore, they hoisted up.

The four anchors they cast out of the stern, <a href="/acts/27-29.htm">Acts 27:29</a> or "when they had cut the anchors", as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it; that is, had cut the cables to which the anchors were fastened: <p>they committed themselves unto the sea; or left them, the anchors, in the sea; or committed the ship to the sea, and themselves in it, endeavouring to steer its course to the place they had in view: <p>and loosed the rudder bands; by which the rudder was fastened to the ship.---The rudder, in navigation, is a piece of timber turning on hinges in the stern of a ship, and which opposing sometimes one side to the water, and sometimes another, turns or directs the vessel this way or that. The rudder of a ship is a piece of timber hung on the stern posts, by four or five iron hooks, called "pintles", serving as it were for the bridle of a ship, to turn her about at the pleasure of the steersman.---The rudder being perpendicular, and without side the ship, another piece of timber is fitted into it at right angles, which comes into the ship, by which the rudder is managed and directed: this latter is properly called the "helm" or "tiller", and sometimes, though improperly, the rudder itself.---A narrow rudder is best for a ship's sailing, provided she can feel it; that is, be guided and turned by it, for a broad rudder will hold much water when the helm is put over to any side; yet if a ship has a fat quarter, so that the water cannot come quick and strong to her rudder, she will require a broad rudder.---The aftmost part of the rudder is called the "rake" of the rudder. This is the account of a rudder with the moderns (z): with the ancients, the parts of the rudder were these, the "clavus" or "helm", by which the rudder was governed; the pole of it; the wings or the two breadths of it, which were as wings, and the handle: some ships had but one rudder, most had two, and some three, and some four; those that had but one, seemed to have it in the middle of the stern; and those that had two had them on the sides, not far from the middle; and there were some ships which had them not only in the stern, but also in the prow or head of the ship (a): that the ancients had sometimes more rudders than one in a ship, has been abundantly proved by Bochartus and Scheherus; take only an instance or two. The Carthaginians, as (b) Aelianus reports, decreed two governors to every ship saying it was absurd that it should have , "two rudders", and that he who was most useful to the sailors, and had the government of the ship, should be alone, and without successor and companion; and so Apuleius (c) says, the ship in which we were carried was shook by various storms and tempests, "utroque regimine amisso", and having lost both its rudders, sunk at the precipice. Some of the Indian ships have three rudders; that of Philopator's had four rudders: how many this ship had, in which the apostle was, cannot be said: but this is certain, that it had more than one; for the words are, "and loosed the bands of the rudders"; and since it is a clear case, that the ships of the ancients had more rudders than one to each, there is no need to suppose a figure in the text, and that the plural number is used for the singular, as Beza thinks: and "the bands" of them were those by which they were fastened; and they were "loosed", as Schefferus conjectures, because when the anchors were cast out, they fastened the rudders higher, that they might not be broken by the dashing of the waves, especially as they were in a storm; but now having taken up the anchors, they loosed these bands: and certain it is, that not only oars but rudders were fastened with cords or ropes to the ship (d): according to the notion of modern navigation, the rudder band might be thought to be the rope which is turned round the tiller, and made fast to the ship's side, and as the tiller is moved, "surges" round the end of the tiller; and very likely might be made fast, when the ship was at anchor, on one side, to keep the ship from breaking her sheer; but now being loosed, and the helm "a midship", and the mainsail hoisted, the ship ran to the shore before the wind. <p>And hoised up the main sail to the wind: which they had before struck or let down, <a href="/acts/27-17.htm">Acts 27:17</a>. The main sail is that which is upon the main mast. The Ethiopic version renders it, "the great sail". The great sail was that which is called "acatius", which is another word than is here used: so Isidore (e) says "acatius" is the greatest sail, and is placed in the middle of the ship; "epidromos" is the next in size, and is placed at the stern; and "dolon" is the least sail, and is fixed at the head: and both the Syriac and Arabic versions here render it, "the little sail"; and which sailors put up when they are afraid to use large sails, which would carry too much wind; but the word here used is "artemo", which the above writer says is commended rather for the sake of directing the ship, than for swiftness. And this seems to be the use that was now made of it, namely, to guide the ship into the creek or bay. <p>And made toward the shore; which was in the creek, or to the haven in it. <p>(z) Chambers's Cyclopaedia in the word "rudder".

A vivid description of the stirring activity now put forth in making every effort to reach the shore. 1. They cut the (four) anchors round about (<span class="greekheb">περιελόντες</span>), and let them fall into the sea, in order neither to lose time nor to burden the ship with their weight. 2. At the same time they loosened the bands, with which they had fastened the rudders to the ship in order to secure them while the ship lay at anchor from the violence of the waves, for the purpose of now using them in moving on. 3. They spread the top-sail before the wind, and thus took their course (<span class="greekheb">κατεῖχον</span>) for the beach (<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν αἰγιαλόν</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἴων</span>] is to be referred to the <span class="greekheb">ἀγκύρας</span>, which they let go by cutting, so that they fell <span class="ital">into the sea</span>.

Labeo in Jabolen. <span class="ital">Dig.</span> lib. 1. tit. 16, leg. 242, points to this view: “Malum navis esse partem, artemonem autem non esse, Labeo ait,” in which words he objects to the confounding of the artemon with the mast: the mast constituted an integral part of the ship, but the artemon did not, because it was fastened to the mast. Luther’s translation: “<span class="ital">mast</span>” [Segelbaum], is therefore certainly incorrect. Grotius, Heumann, Rosenmüller, and others, including Smith, explain it of “<span class="ital">the small sail at the prow of the ship</span>.” In this they assume that the mast had already been lowered; but this is entirely arbitrary, as Luke, although he relates every particular so expressly, has never mentioned this (comp. on <a href="/acts/27-17.htm" title="Which when they had taken up, they used helps, under girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.">Acts 27:17</a>).

Others apply it to the stern-sail, which bears the name to-day (Italian, <span class="ital">artimone</span>; French, <span class="ital">voile d’artimon</span>), but to set this sail would have been the most foolish thing they could have done, so Vars, Breusing. The word is found only here for the foresail, and its meaning is fixed by the fact that no other sail could be so well used by sailors under the circumstances, see Breusing, p. 79, J. Smith, pp. 141 and 193 ff., 4th edit. In his edition, 1899, Wendt thinks it probable that the sail here meant is otherwise called <span class="greekheb">δόλων</span>, but see J. Smith, p. 200, 4th edit. In his former edition he preferred to interpret it of the topsail (Meyer, Weiss, Zöckler, Baumgarten), but Breusing, p. xii., points out that only in the sixteenth century were topsails introduced; see also Vars, p. 93.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[422] English Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">40</span>. <span class="ital">And when they had taken up the anchors</span>] The verb in the original implies that they cast loose all the anchors round about the stern of the vessel where they had laid them out. So the <span class="ital">R.

The rudders, of which the ancient ships had two, had been made fast, and raised out of the water, when the anchors were laid out in the stern. Now that an attempt is to be made to steer the ship toward the beach they are let down again into the water.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and hoised up the mainsail</span>] The Gk. Word “artemon” here used, was in old times the name given to the “foresail” of the vessel, and so it should be rendered here.

This verse, so obscure before, has been made intelligible by the masterly labors of Smith, of Jordan Hill. We will first explain the separate words. <span class="cmt_word">Casting off</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in ver. 20; in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-16.htm">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>; and in <a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>; and in all those passages is rendered "<span class="accented">taken</span> away." So also in the LXX., where it is of frequent use, it means "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "<span class="accented">put</span> away," "<span class="accented">remove</span>," and the like. In classical Greek it means to "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "take off," "strip off." Here, then, applied to the anchors which were firmly embedded in the very strong clay at the bottom of the sea off Koura Point, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> means "putting away" or "casting off" the anchors by cutting the cables which fastened them to the ship, and, as it follows, <span class="cmt_word">leaving them in the sea</span>, or, more literally, <span class="accented">giving them up, dismissing them into the sea</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="/acts/5-38.htm">Acts 5:38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Loosing the bands of the rudders</span>. "The ships of the Greeks and Romans, like those of the early Northmen were not steered by a single rudder, but by two paddle-rudders" (Howson, p. 310. See too an illustration from an ancient painting found at Herculaneum, in which the two paddle-rudders are very distinctly seen, at p. 346; and another illustration in Lewin, vol. it. p. 204, showing the two rudders and the foresail). These paddle-rudders had been hoisted up and lashed, lest they should foul the anchors at the stern. But now, when the free use of them was absolutely necessary to steer the ship toward the beach, they unloosed the lashings, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span> "the bands of the rudders," and at the same time they hoisted up the foresail. <span class="cmt_word">The foresail</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, a word found only here in this sense, but used in Vitruvius for a "pulley," and so explained in Ducange. But <span class="accented">artimon</span> was till recently used in Venice and Genoa as the name of the large sail of a vessel. In the Middle Ages <span class="accented">artimonium</span> was the "foremast," <span class="accented">mat de prone</span>; but it was also used of the foresail," Velum naris breve, quod quia melius levari potest, in summo periculo extenditur" (Ducange). They hoisted the foresail both to give them sufficient way to run on to the beach, and to give precision to their steering. (For a further account of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, or foresail, see Smith, of Jordan Hill.) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Taken up (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Wrong.
