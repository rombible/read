And it is next to a miracle of providence, that no greater number of religious persons have been murdered in the world, by the way of perjury and pretence of law, when so many thousands hate them, who make no conscience of false oaths. Wisdom and holiness make a man's face to shine, yet will not secure men from being treated badly. What shall we say of man, a rational being, yet attempting to uphold a religious system by false witness and murder! And this has been done in numberless instances. But the blame rests not so much upon the understanding, as upon the heart of a fallen creature, which is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Yet the servant of the Lord, possessing a clear conscience, cheerful hope, and Divine consolations, may smile in the midst of danger and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And set up false witnesses - It has been made a question why these persons are called "false" witnesses, since it is supposed by many that they reported merely the "words" of Stephen. It may be replied that if they did report merely his "words"; if Stephen had actually said what they affirmed, yet they perverted his meaning. They accused him of "blasphemy"; that is, of calumnious and reproachful words against Moses and against God That Stephen had spoken in such a manner, or had designed to "reproach" Moses, there is no evidence. What was said in the mildest manner, and in the way of cool argument, might easily be perverted so as in "their view" to amount to blasphemy. But there is no evidence whatever that Stephen had ever used these words on any occasion, and it is altogether improbable that he ever did, for the following reasons:<p>(1) Jesus himself never affirmed that he would destroy that place. He uniformly taught that it would be done by the "Gentiles," <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>. It is altogether improbable, therefore, that Stephen should declare any such thing.<p>(2) it is equally improbable that he taught that Jesus would abolish the special customs and rites of the Jews. It was long, and after much discussion, before the apostles themselves were convinced that they were to be changed, and when they were changed it was done gradually. See <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a>, etc.; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-2.htm">Acts 11:2</a>, etc.; <a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>, etc. The probability therefore is, that the whole testimony was "false," and was artfully invented to produce the utmost exasperation among the people, and yet was at the same time so plausible as to be easily believed. For on this point the Jews were particularly sensitive; and it is clear that they had some expectations that the Messiah would produce some such changes. Compare <a href="/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26-27</a>. The same charge was afterward brought against Paul, which he promptly denied.

Though we have no words of his hitherto recorded, we can see from the character of his defence in the next chapter that he must have been heard to declare that the worship of God was no longer to be restricted as it had been to the Temple at Jerusalem. And just as in the accusation of Christ (<a href="/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>) the witnesses (called, as here, false, and for a like reason) perverted a saying of Jesus, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,” which St John (<a href="/john/2-21.htm" title="But he spoke of the temple of his body.">John 2:21</a>) explains, into “I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days,” so the words of Stephen which spake of a worship now “to be bound to no fixed spot, and fettered by no inflexible externality” (Zeller), were twisted into blasphemy against the Temple and the law, called in <span class="ital"><a href="/acts/6-11.htm" title="Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.">Acts 6:11</a></span> blasphemy against Moses and against God; and by the use of these two phrases as equivalent the one to the other, they shew us how God and Moses meant for them no more than their Temple and its ritual.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words</span>] The best authorities omit <span class="ital">blasphemous</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:">Acts 6:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ παύεται</span>, <span class="ital">ceaseth not</span>) They attempt to create odium against him.—<span class="greekheb">ῥήματα λαλῶν</span>, <span class="ital">to speak words</span> of blasphemy) The same phrase occurs in <a href="/luke/12-10.htm" title="And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemes against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.">Luke 12:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ νόμου</span>, <span class="ital">the law</span>) See <a href="/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a>, at the end.
