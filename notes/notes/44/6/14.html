And it is next to a miracle of providence, that no greater number of religious persons have been murdered in the world, by the way of perjury and pretence of law, when so many thousands hate them, who make no conscience of false oaths. Wisdom and holiness make a man's face to shine, yet will not secure men from being treated badly. What shall we say of man, a rational being, yet attempting to uphold a religious system by false witness and murder! And this has been done in numberless instances. But the blame rests not so much upon the understanding, as upon the heart of a fallen creature, which is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.

The prophecy, we cannot doubt, had made its impression not only upon the disciples, but also upon the enemies of Jesus, and if St. Stephen did not employ the actual words, we can easily understand how easily and plausibly they might be attributed to him.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλάξει τὰ ἔθη</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/ezra/6-11.htm" title="Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.">Ezra 6:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/24-5.htm" title="The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.">Isaiah 24:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἔθος</span> is used by St. Luke seven times in Acts, three times in his Gospel, and it is only found twice elsewhere in the N.T., <a href="/john/19-40.htm" title="Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.">John 19:40</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm" title="Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.">Hebrews 10:25</a>; in the Books of the Maccabees it occurs three or four times, in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/4-16.htm" title="Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodly which are living; and youth that is soon perfected the many years and old age of the unrighteous.">Wis 4:16</a> (but see Hatch and Redpath), in Bel and the Dragon <a href="/acts/6-15.htm" title="And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.">Acts 6:15</a>, in the sense of custom, usage, as so often in the classics.

The attempt which has been made to shew that the charge against Stephen is merely a reproduction of that made against Jesus is seen to be futile when we observe that in Stephen’s case the witnesses know nothing of “the raising up again of the temple,” and that Stephen himself, by not contradicting but explaining their accusation, in his defence points out that their statement had a widely different origin from that which gave cause to the accusation of Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) Observe the inference unfairly drawn from the best words, <a href="/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:">Acts 6:13</a>.—<span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span>, <span class="ital">this</span> Jesus) Demonstrative, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-3.htm" title="Understand therefore this day, that the LORD your God is he which goes over before you; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before your face: so shall you drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has said to you.">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>, <span class="greekheb">Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου οὗτος προπορεύσεται</span>, but used by the adversaries of Stephen in bitterness, and contemptuously.

Stephen, inasmuch as it was now mature time, had intimated something of those things which were about to come to pass. And he seems almost to have seen farther into the truth concerning the abrogation of legal rites, than Peter did before the reply of the Spirit, ch. <a href="/acts/10-19.htm" title="While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.">Acts 10:19</a>, with which comp. what precedes, <a href="/acts/6-15.htm" title="And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.">Acts 6:15</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Unto us for us, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We have heard him say</span>, etc. These false witnesses, like those who distorted our Lord's words (<a href="/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>; <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>), doubtless based their accusation upon some semblance of truth.
