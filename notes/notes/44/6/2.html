They do not resent the suspicion; they are not careful to vindicate themselves against it. They remembered, it may be, the precedent presented by the life of Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm" title="And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.">Exodus 18:25</a>), and they act, as he had acted, by delegating part of their authority to others. The collective action of the multitude is strikingly in harmony with the Greek ideas attached to the word <span class= "ital">Ecclesia, </span>as the assembly in which every citizen might take his share.

See Whitby. It was of great importance that the apostles should immediately take measures to suppress these rising murmurs and discontents; for had they been suffered to remain and take root, they might have produced dangerous disputes and divisions, and have involved the apostles themselves in suspicion and censure. <span class="ital">It is not reason</span> — <span class="greekheb">Ουκ αρεστον εστιν</span>, <span class="ital">it is not right, proper, </span>or, <span class="ital">pleasing; </span>namely, to God; <span class="ital">that we </span>— Who have an office to discharge of so much greater weight and consequence; <span class="ital">should leave the word of God </span>— Should be less frequently employed in dispensing it; <span class="ital">and serve tables </span>— Attend to the distribution of money to relieve the wants of the poor; and yet this we must do, in order to prevent these complaints, unless some further measures be taken by common consent. <span class="ital">Wherefore, brethren </span>— As you see how inconvenient it would be to suffer this care to lie upon us, and how inevitably it would render us incapable of attending to the proper duties of our office; <span class="ital">look ye out among you seven men </span>— A number sufficient for the present; <span class="ital">of honest report </span>— That there may be no room to suspect them of partiality and injustice; <span class="ital">full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom </span>— For it is not a light matter to dispense even the temporal goods of the church. To do even this well, a large measure both of the gifts and grace of God is requisite. <span class="ital">Whom we may appoint over this business </span>— It would have been happy for the church, had its ordinary ministers, in every age, taken the same care to act in concert with the people committed to their charge, which the apostles themselves, extraordinary as their office was, did on this and other occasions. It may be proper to observe here, that in the first church, the primary business of apostles, evangelists, and elders, was to preach the word of God; the secondary, to take a kind of paternal care (the church being then like a family) for the support especially of the poor, the strangers, and the widows. Afterward, as here, the deacons were constituted for this latter business. And whatever time they had to spare from this, they employed in works of spiritual mercy. But their proper office was to take care of the poor. And when some of them afterward preached the gospel, they did this, not by virtue of their deaconship, but of another commission, that of evangelists, which they probably received, not before, but after they were appointed <span class="ital">deacons. </span>And it is not unlikely that others were chosen <span class="ital">deacons, </span>or <span class="ital">stewards, </span>in their room, when any of these commenced <span class="ital">evangelists. But we </span>— Being thus freed from this great encumbrance; <span class="ital">will give ourselves continually </span>— Will dedicate our whole time; <span class="ital">to prayer, and to the ministry of the word </span>— Which is our grand business, and which we would be glad to prosecute without interruption. It is, doubtless, still the proper business of a Christian minister, whether termed a pastor, elder, or bishop, to speak to God in prayer; and to men in preaching his word, as an ambassador for Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Hitherto the disciples had been of one accord; this often had been noticed to their honour; but now they were multiplied, they began to murmur. The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares, and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must be duly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, and hating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church, ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church. They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of God are greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who were least likely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the twelve - That is, the apostles. Matthias had been added to them after the apostasy of Judas, which had completed the original number.<p>The multitude of the disciples - It is not necessary to suppose that all the disciples were convened, which amounted to many thousands, but that the business was laid before a large number; or perhaps "the multitude" here means those merely who were more particularly interested in the matter, and who had been engaged in the complaint.<p>It is not reason - The original words used here properly denote "it is not pleasing or agreeable"; but the meaning evidently is, it is not "suitable" or "proper." It would be a departure from the design of their appointment, which was to preach the gospel, and not to attend to the pecuniary affairs of the church.<p>Leave the word of God - That we should neglect or abandon the preaching of the gospel so much as would be necessary if we attended personally to the distribution of the alms of the church. The "gospel" is here called the "Word of God," because it is his message; it is what he has spoken, or which he has commanded to be proclaimed to people.<p>Serve tables - This expression properly denotes "to take care of, or provide for the table, or for the daily needs of a family." It is an expression that properly applies to a steward or a servant. The word "tables" is, however, sometimes used with reference to "money," as being the place where money was kept for the purpose of "exchange, etc.," <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-27.htm">Matthew 25:27</a>.

The twelve apostles, as the Syriac version reads; for their number was now complete, Matthias being chosen in the room of Judas: these being informed of the murmur there was between the two sorts of believers, the Hebrew and thc Hellenistic Jews, <p>called the multitude of the disciples unto them; either the hundred and twenty, the original members of the church, which first formed it, and on whom the Holy Ghost descended on the day of Pentecost; or rather the whole body of the church: for what the apostles had to say concerned them all; and they all had an equal right to chose their officers, that should minister unto them; and when they were convened together, they addressed them after this manner: <p>and said, it is not reason; or "it is not pleasing", neither to God, nor to us; so the Arabic version reads, "this does not please us"; nor could it be pleasing to the church itself: <p>that we should leave the word of God the study of the word, meditation upon it, and preaching it: not that they did relinquish either of these; but they were sometimes obliged to omit them, or not so frequently attend them; the care of the poor taking up more of their time, than the work of the ministry, or preaching of the Gospel would admit of; and therefore thought it not so right and proper, or so acceptable a thing to God and man, that they should in the least neglect a work of so great importance to the souls of men, and cause it to give way to that which only regarded their bodies: <p>and serve tables; the tables of the poor, collect for them, inspect into their several cases, and circumstances, and distribute accordingly to them; which required a good deal of time, care, thought, and circumspection, especially in such a church, where the numbers were so large. From hence we learn what is the business of deacons, who were afterwards appointed to take this part of the apostles' work off of their hands, and attend to it; which is to serve tables: the table of the Lord, by providing the bread and wine for it; receiving both from the minister, when blessed, and distributing them to the members; and collecting from them for the poor, and the defraying the charge; and observing what members are missing at the ordinance, whom they are to admonish; and if their admonitions are not regarded, to report it to the church: and they are likewise to serve the minister's table, by taking care that he has a sufficient competency for his support; and it belongs to them to stir up the members of the church to their duty in communicating to him; and what they receive of them, they are to apply to his use: and also, they are to serve the poor's table; to whom they are to distribute of the church's stock, with all impartiality, simplicity, cheerfulness, and sympathy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples <i>unto them</i>, and said, It is not <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> tables.</span><p>(2) The office of preaching the word, and dispensing the goods of the Church, are different from one another, and not rashly to be joined together, as the apostles institute here.

The passage has been quoted in support of the democratic constitution of the Apostolic Church, but the whole context shows that the government really lay with the Apostles. The Church as a whole is under their direction and counsel, and the Apostles alone determine what qualification those chosen should possess, the Apostles alone lay hands upon them after prayer: “The hand of man is laid upon the person, but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained” (Chrys., <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, xiv.). The dignity of the Apostles, and their authority as leaders of the Church and ordainers of the Seven, is fully recognised by Feine, but he considers that their position is so altered, and the organisation of the Church so much more developed, that another source and not the Jerusalem <span class="ital">Quellen-schrift</span> must be supposed; but if, as Feine allows, such passages as <a href="/acts/4-34.htm" title="Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,">Acts 4:34</a>, <a href="/acts/5-2.htm" title="And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.">Acts 5:2</a>, belong to the Jerusalem source, it would appear that the authority of the Apostles in the passage before us was a very plain and natural development.—<span class="greekheb">καταλείψαντας</span>: on the formation of the first aorist see Blass, <span class="ital">Grammatik</span>, p. 43, and also Deissmann, <span class="ital">Neue Bibelstudien</span>, p. 18; Winer-Schmiedel, p. 109.—<span class="greekheb">διακονεῖν τραπέζαις</span>: there seems to be an intentional antithesis between these words and <span class="greekheb">τῇ διακονίᾳ τοῦ λόγου</span> in <a href="/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3</a>. The Twelve do not object to the work of ministering, but only to the neglect of ministering to the higher sustenance for the sake of the lower (Hort, <span class="ital">Ecclesia</span>, p. 206); thus Bengel speaks of the expression as used with indignation, “Antitheton, <span class="ital">ministerium verbi</span>”. <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> and <span class="greekheb">διακονεῖν</span> are used for ministrations to man, although more usually of man to God; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>, of service to St. Paul, <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span>, <a href="/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>, of service to the brethren of Judæa in the famine, <a href="/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>; <a href="/romans/15-31.htm" title="That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;">Romans 15:31</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.">2 Corinthians 8:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:">2 Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;...">2 Corinthians 9:12-13</a>, of the Gentile collections for the same purpose, so too probably in <a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a> of the service rendered by Stephanas to travelling Christians, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm" title="For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.">Hebrews 6:10</a>, and its use of the verb in the Gospels of ministering to our Lord’s earthly wants, <a href="/luke/8-3.htm" title="And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered to him of their substance.">Luke 8:3</a>; <a href="/luke/10-40.htm" title="But Martha was encumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.">Luke 10:40</a> (both noun and verb), <a href="/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="/luke/12-37.htm" title="Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.">Luke 12:37</a>; <a href="/luke/22-27.htm" title="For whether is greater, he that sits at meat, or he that serves? is not he that sits at meat? but I am among you as he that serves.">Luke 22:27</a>, <a href="/matthew/4-11.htm" title="Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.">Matthew 4:11</a>, <a href="/luke/4-39.htm" title="And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered to them.">Luke 4:39</a>; see further on the use of the word in classical Greek, Hort, <span class="ital">Ecclesia</span>, p. 203. The word had a high dignity conferred upon it when, in contrast to the contemptuous associations which surrounded it for the most part in Greek society, Epictetus remarks that it is man’s true honour to be a <span class="greekheb">διάκονος</span> of God (<span class="ital">Diss.</span>, iii., 22, 69; 24, 65; iv. 7, 20; <span class="ital">cf.</span> iii. 26, 28), and a dignity immeasurably higher still, when the Son of Man could speak of Himself as in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/22-27.htm" title="For whether is greater, he that sits at meat, or he that serves? is not he that sits at meat? but I am among you as he that serves.">Luke 22:27</a>. “Every clergyman begins as a deacon. This is right. But he never ceases to be a deacon. The priest is a deacon still. The bishop is a deacon still. Christ came as a deacon, lived as a deacon, died as a deacon: <span class="greekheb">μὴ διακονηθῆναι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ διακονῆσαι</span>” (Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Ordination Sermons</span>, p. 115). In the LXX the verb does not occur at all, but <span class="greekheb">διάκονος</span> is used four times in <a href="/esther/1-10.htm" title="On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,">Esther 1:10</a>; <a href="/esther/2-2.htm" title="Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:">Esther 2:2</a>; <a href="/esther/6-3.htm" title="And the king said, What honor and dignity has been done to Mordecai for this?

And the king said, Let him come in.">Esther 6:5</a>, of the king’s chamberlains and of the servants that ministered to him, and once in 4Ma 9:17; <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> is also found in two of the passages in Esther just quoted, <a href="/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3</a>; <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>, where in A we read <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐκ τῆς διακοίας</span> (BS <span class="greekheb">διάκονοι</span>), and once in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/11-58.htm" title="Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle.">1Ma 11:58</a>, of the service of gold sent by Jonathan to Antiochus. What is meant by the expression here? does it refer to distribution of money or in kind? The word in itself might include either, but if we were to limit <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> to alms, yet the use of the word remarked upon above renders the service higher than that of ordinary relief: “<span class="ital">ministration</span>” says St. Chrysostom (although he takes it of alms, <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, 15), “extolling by this at once the doers and those to whom it was done”. But <span class="greekheb">τραπέζαις</span> presents a further difficulty; does it refer to the tables of exchange for money, a rendering which claims support from <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-27.htm" title="You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with usury.">Matthew 25:27</a>, <a href="/luke/19-23.htm" title="Why then gave not you my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with usury?">Luke 19:23</a>, <a href="/john/2-15.htm" title="And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;">John 2:15</a>, or to tables for food, <a href="/luke/16-21.htm" title="And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.">Luke 16:21</a>; <a href="/luke/22-21.htm" title="But, behold, the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table.">Luke 22:21</a>; <a href="/luke/22-30.htm" title="That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Luke 22:30</a>? Possibly the use of the word in some passages in the N.T., and also the fact that the <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> was <span class="greekheb">καθημερινή</span>, may indicate the latter, and the phrase may refer to the actual serving and superintending at the tables at which the poor sat, or at all events to the supplying in a general way those things which were necessary for their bodily sustenance. Zöckler, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span> (second edition), refers the word to the ministration of the gifts of love offered at the Eucharist in the various Christian houses (so Scaliger understood the expression of the Agapæ). Mr. Humphry reminds us that the words were quoted by Latimer (1548) in a sermon against some bishops of his time who were comptrollers of the mint.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them</span>] They found that there was cause for the complaint, and at once prepared to provide a remedy. By “the multitude of the disciples” we are not to suppose that an attempt was made to gather every one who in Jerusalem called himself a Christian, but that a large and special meeting was convened, before which the Apostles laid their plan. The funds had been given by various persons, and were for the common relief; it was therefore fit that a change in the distributors should be considered in common.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and said, It is not reason</span>] The word properly means <span class="ital">pleasing</span>, and the idea meant to be conveyed is that it was not <span class="ital">meet</span> that the Apostles should leave the higher functions to which they had been specially appointed, and spend their whole time in the business duties to which the present emergency had given rise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables</span>] Better, “<span class="bld">forsake</span> the word.” The verb in the original is a strong form, and indicates that the whole time of the twelve was being spent on this disbursement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="ital">tables</span> is meant the bench or counter at which the money was distributed. Both in Hebrew and Greek <span class="ital">bankers</span> are “tablers.” Cf. “the <span class="ital">tables</span> of the moneychangers” (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word for <span class="ital">serve</span> is <span class="ital">diakonein</span>, akin to the noun in the previous verse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/6-2.htm" title="Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.">Acts 6:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">that we</span>) the apostles.—<span class="greekheb">καταλείψαντας</span>, <span class="ital">having left</span>) They were not able at once to attend to both: for which reason they sustain that function which is the more noble. It is dangerous to leave those duties which have been especially entrusted to us. This often happens whilst we are unconscious of it. The bishops have put far away from them this principle, since they have become so involved in worldly things, that spiritual things, excepting the solemn outward pageant, are almost entirely swallowed up in their princely function.—<span class="greekheb">διακονεῖν τραπέζαις</span>, <span class="ital">to minister to tables</span>) The phrase expresses the doing of something unworthy of their office. The antithesis is <span class="ital">the ministry of the word</span>, <a href="/acts/6-4.htm" title="But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.">Acts 6:4</a>. What were the functions of the <span class="ital">deacons</span> in the primitive Church, is a subject of copious disquisition: but the matter may be comprised in a few words. It was the especial duty of the bishops, apostles, evangelists, etc., to preach the word of GOD; it was their secondary duty to have a kind of fatherly care (for the Church was, at the beginning, like a family) of the sustenance, particularly of the poor, of strangers, of widows, etc. But the <span class="ital">deacons</span>, of both sexes, were appointed strictly to have the same care of the sustenance of the brethren: and in that department they felt it necessary to bestow very much exertion on the church of Jerusalem; in other places, more or less care as circumstances suggested; whatever exertions they could make, after their principal duty was attended to, they devoted to the preaching of the word.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fit</span> for reasons, A.V.; <span class="accented">forsake</span> for <span class="accented">leave</span>, A.V.

The English reader should remember that the "ministration" of ver. 1, the "serve" of this verse, and the "deacon" which was the name of the new officers, are all forms of the same Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). In ver. 4 "the ministry of the Word" is opposed to "the daily ministration" of meat. The passage gives a necessary warning to the ministers of God's Word not to spend too much time and strength upon any secular work, even though it be a work of charity. They must give themselves to the Word of God and to prayer.
