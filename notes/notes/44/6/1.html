Now they were becoming a prominent section of the Church, perhaps more numerous than the Hebrews, or Jews of Palestine. They, as their name implies, spoke Greek habitually, and as a rule did not read the older Hebrew or speak the current Aramaic. They read the Septuagint (LXX.) version of the Old Testament. They were commonly more zealous, with the zeal of pilgrims, for the sanctity of the holy places than the Jews of Jerusalem itself, who had been familiar with them from infancy (<a href="/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Because their widows were neglected.</span>—The words imply something like an organised administration of the common fund: widows and their children being the chief objects of relief. The rules of <a href="/context/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1Timothy 5:3-16</a>, were probably the growth of a more mature experience; and here we have to think of a clamorous crowd of applicants besieging the house at which the Apostles held their meeting at the times appointed for giving relief in money, or, as seems more probable, in kind. The Twelve—singly, or in groups—sat at the table, and gave as they were able. It was like the dole of alms at the gate of a convent. Under such circumstances, jealousies and complaints were all but in- evitable. The Twelve were all of them Galileans, and were suspected of favouring the widows of Palestine rather than those of the Dispersion. It was the first sign that the new society was outgrowing its primitive organisation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">In those days </span>— Some time after the fact last recorded had taken place; <span class="ital">when the number of the disciples was multiplied </span>— For it appears their number increased continually and rapidly, notwithstanding the opposition made by the priests and rulers to the preaching of the gospel: indeed that opposition, instead of checking the progress of Christianity, contributed to it: <span class="ital">there arose a murmuring </span>— The historian’s manner of speaking, <span class="greekheb">πληθυνοντων των μαθητων εγενετο γογγυσμος</span>, <span class="ital">the disciples multiplying, there arose a murmuring, </span>seems to imply, that the murmuring was partly, at least, the consequence of the great increase of the disciples. And certainly, 1st, In proportion as the number of Christians increased, the scandal of the cross would be diminished, and many would be inclined to unite themselves to them, who were influenced by motives not perfectly pure, and were not truly converted to God, and made new creatures in Christ. 2d, The accession of a great number of converts to the church, perhaps chiefly from the poor, would render it more difficult than it was before, to afford all the necessitous a proper supply. But, whatever was the cause of the murmuring here spoken of, it was the first breach made on those who were before <span class="ital">of one heart and of one soul. </span>Partiality crept in unawares on some, and murmuring on others. Ah, Lord! how short a time did pure, genuine, undefiled Christianity remain in the world! How soon was its glory, at least in some measure, eclipsed! <span class="ital">Of the Grecians </span>— Greek, <span class="ital">of the Hellenists, </span>that is, the Jews born out of Judea, so called, because they used the Greek as their native language. These were descendants of such Jews as, in several national calamities, had been forced to flee to Alexandria, and other Gentile countries, or, on account of trade and commerce, had chosen to settle there, and yet kept themselves unmixed with the Gentiles; and, retaining the knowledge of the true God, were wont to come occasionally, especially on the solemn feasts, to worship at Jerusalem. <span class="ital">Against the Hebrews </span>— Who were natives of Judea, and therefore used a dialect of the Hebrew, or Syro-Chaldaic tongue; <span class="ital">because their widows were neglected </span>— In some degree, as they supposed; <span class="ital">in the daily ministration </span>— Of the charities that were distributed to the poor members of the church. It is justly observed here by Mr. Scott, that “as the greatest part of the public stock must have been contributed by the Hebrews, perhaps they, who acted under the apostles in this business, thought it right to show more favour to the poor widows of that description than the others.” It is very probable, however, that the Hellenists suspected more partiality than there really was. Be this as it may, by this real or supposed partiality of the Hebrews, and the murmuring of the Hellenists, there is reason to think the Spirit of God was grieved, and the seeds of a general persecution were sown. For, did God ever, in any age or country, withdraw his restraining providence, and let loose the world upon the Christians, till there was a cause for it among themselves? Is not an open, general persecution, always both penal and medicinal? a punishment of those that will not accept of milder reproofs as well as a medicine to heal their sickness? and at the same time a means of purifying and strengthening those whose hearts are still right with God?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-7 Hitherto the disciples had been of one accord; this often had been noticed to their honour; but now they were multiplied, they began to murmur. The word of God was enough to take up all the thoughts, cares, and time of the apostles. The persons chosen to serve tables must be duly qualified. They must be filled with gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, necessary to rightly managing this trust; men of truth, and hating covetousness. All who are employed in the service of the church, ought to be commended to the Divine grace by the prayers of the church. They blessed them in the name of the Lord. The word and grace of God are greatly magnified, when those are wrought upon by it, who were least likely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In those days ... - The first part of this chapter contains an account of the appointment of "deacons." It may be asked, perhaps, why the apostles did not appoint these officers at the first organization of the church? To this, question we may reply, that it was better to defer the appointment until an occasion should occur when it would appear to be manifestly necessary and proper. When the church was small, its alms could be distributed by the apostles themselves without difficulty But when it was greatly increased when its charities were multiplied; and when the distribution might give rise to contentions, it was necessary that this matter should be entrusted to the hands of "laymen," and that the "ministry" should be freed from all embarrassment, and all suspicions of dishonesty and unfairness in regard to pecuniary matters. It has never been found to be wise that the temporal affairs of the church should be entrusted in any considerable degree to the clergy, and they should be freed from such sources of difficulty and embarrassment.<p>Was multiplied - By the accession of the three thousand on the day of Pentecost, and of those who were subsequently added, <a href="/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>; <a href="/acts/5-14.htm">Acts 5:14</a>.<p>A murmuring - A complaint - as if there had been partiality in the distribution.<p>Of the Grecians - There has been much diversity of opinion in regard to these persons, whether they were "Jews" who had lived among the Gentiles, and who spoke the Greek language, or whether they were proselytes from the Gentiles. The former is probably the correct opinion. The word used here is not what is commonly employed to designate the inhabitants of Greece, but it properly denotes those who "imitate" the customs and habits of the Greeks, who use the Greek language, etc. In the time when the gospel was first preached, there were two classes of Jews - those who remained in Palestine, who used the Hebrew language, and who were appropriately called "Hebrews"; and those who were scattered among the Gentiles, who spoke the Greek language, and who used in their synagogues the Greek translation of the Old Testament, called the Septuagint. These were called "Hellenists," or, as it is in our translation, "Grecians." See the notes on <a href="/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a>. These were doubtless the persons mentioned here - not those who were proselyted from Gentiles, but those of Jewish origin who were not natives of Judea, who had come up to Jerusalem to attend the great festivals. See <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9-11</a>. Dissensions would be very likely to arise between these two classes of persons. The Jews of Palestine would pride themselves much on the fact that they dwelt in the land of the patriarchs and the land of promise; that they used the language which their fathers spoke, and in which the oracles of God were given; and that they were constantly near the temple, and regularly engaged in its solemnities. On the other hand, the Jews from other parts of the world would be suspicious, jealous, and envious of their brethren, and would be likely to charge them with partiality, or of taking advantage in their contact with them. These occasions of strife would not be destroyed by their conversion to Christianity, and one of them is furnished on this occasion.<p>Because their widows ... - The property which had been contributed, or thrown into common stock, was understood to be designed for the equal benefit of "all" the poor, and particularly, it would seem, for the poor widows. The distribution before this seems to have been made by the apostles themselves - or possibly, as Mosheim conjectures (Commentary de rebus Christianorum ante Constantinum, pp. 139, 118), the apostles committed the distribution of these funds to the Hebrews, and hence, the Grecians are represented as complaining against them, and not against the apostles.<p>In the daily ministration - In the daily distribution which was made for their needs. Compare <a href="/acts/4-35.htm">Acts 4:35</a>. The property was contributed doubtless with an understanding that it should be "equally" distributed to all classes of Christians that had need. It is clear from the Epistles that "widows" were objects of special attention in the primitive church, and that the first Christians regarded it as a matter of indispensable obligation to provide for their needs, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm">1 Timothy 5:9-10</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Ac 6:1-7.

From an hundred and twenty to three thousand more, from thence to five thousand more, and after that a multitude of men and women were added, and still they were increasing; see <a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a> <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>. This increase of the disciples agrees with what Maimonides says (z), before observed, that <p>"in the days of Gamaliel, , "the heretics were multiplied in Israel".'' <p>The word "disciples" was a common name to all Christians, to all that believed in Christ, and was the name they went by, before they were called Christians, <a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a><p>there arose a murmuring of the Grecians, or Hellenists, against the Hebrews; by the Hebrews are meant the Jews that dwelt in Judea, and were the inhabitants of that country, and chiefly of Jerusalem, who spoke the Hebrew, or rather the Syriac language; and by the Grecians, or Hellenists, are meant, not the Greeks that were proselyted to the Jewish religion, though there might be some few among them; but Jews who were born, and had dwelt, in some parts of Greece, and spoke the Greek language, and used the Septuagint version of the Bible; between these two a murmuring arose, a complaint was made by one against the other: so that, as it appears from the instance of Ananias and Sapphira, that this first and pure Gospel church was not free from hypocrites; it is also manifest, that though they were at first so united and harmonious in their affections and judgments, yet they were not always clear of feuds, animosities, and contentions; Satan bestirred himself, and got footing among them, as he commonly does where the Gospel is preached, and there is an increase of it: the reason of this uneasiness was, <p>because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration; that is, they had not that distributed which was necessary for them, nor so much as the Hebrew widows; they complained of partiality, as if because the Hebrew widows were the natives of the country, and might be nearly related to many of the community, that therefore they were more regarded and better supplied every day, than their widows were, whose husbands had dwelt in foreign lands, and were not so well known, and had fewer acquaintance and relations; for it seems the ministration or distribution was made every day: and such a practice obtained among the Jews in common, who used to collect every day for the poor, and give it daily to them. Maimonides (a) speaks of it in this manner; <p>"they appoint collectors, who receive "every day", from every court, a piece of bread, or any sort of food, or fruit, or money, from whomsoever that offers freely for the time; and they divide that which is collected, "in the evening", among the poor, and they give to every poor person of it "his daily sustenance"; and this is called  "Tamchui", or "the alms dish".'' <p>And from hence the apostles might take up this custom, and follow it. The Ethiopic version renders it, "because they saw their widows minister", or "employed daily"; as if the complaint was, that their widows were too much made use of, and obliged to more frequent and to harder service in taking care of the poor, the sick, and helpless, than the other widows were, who had not their share of labour with them, but lived more at ease. Though others rather think the murmur was, because the Grecian widows were not taken into the number, and employed in taking care of the poor, as the Hebrew widows were; but the sense first given, of not having so good a share in the distribution, seems to be the best. <p>(z) Hilchot Tephilla, c. 2. sect. 1.((a) Hilchot Mattanot Annayim, c. 9. sect. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> daily ministration.</span><p>(1) When Satan has assailed the Church on the outside, and with little result and in vain, he assails it on the inside, with civil dissension and strife between themselves: but the apostles take occasion by this to set order in the Church.<p>(a) From among their own members, who became religious Jews from among the Greeks.<p>(b) In the bestowing of alms according to their need.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] Over against this new victory of the church without, there now emerges a division in its own bosom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς ἡμέρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ταύτ</span>.] namely, while the apostles continued, after their liberation, to devote themselves unmolested to their function of preaching (<a href="/acts/5-42.htm" title="And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.">Acts 5:42</a>).

On St. Luke’s fondness for this and similar words (Friedrich) see p. 73. Weiss calls it here a very modest word, introduced by one who knew nothing of the conversions in many of the preceding chapters. But the word, and especially its use in the present participle, rather denotes that the numbers went on increasing, and so rapidly that the Apostles found the work of relief too great for them.—<span class="greekheb">μαθητῶν</span>, the word occurs here for the first time in the Acts (surely an insufficient ground for maintaining with Hilgenfeld that we are dealing with a new source). The same word is found frequently in each of the Gospels, twenty-eight times in Acts (<span class="greekheb">μαθήτρια</span> once, <a href="/acts/9-36.htm" title="Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.">Acts 9:36</a>), but never in the Epistles. It evidently passed into the ancient language of the early Church from the earthly days of the ministry of Jesus, and may fairly be regarded as the earliest designation of the Christians; but as the associations connected with it (the thought that Jesus was the <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλος</span> and His followers His <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span>) passed into the background it quickly dropped out of use, although in the <span class="ital">Acts</span> the name is still the rule for the more ancient times and for the Jewish-Christian Churches; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>. In the Acts we have the transition marked from <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span> to the <span class="ital">brethren</span> and <span class="ital">saints</span> of the Epistles. The reason for the change is obvious. During the lifetime of Jesus the disciples were called after their relationship to Him; after His departure the names given indicated their relation to each other and to the society (Dr. Sanday, <span class="ital">Inspiration</span>, p. 289). And as an evidential test of the date of the various N.T. writings this is just what we might expect: the Gospels have their own characteristic vocabulary, the Epistles have theirs, whilst Acts forms a kind of link between the two groups, Gospels and Epistles. It is, of course, to be remembered that both terms <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span> are also found in Acts, not to the exclusion of, but alongside with, <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span> (<span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, <a href="/acts/9-26.htm" title="And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.">Acts 9:26</a>; <a href="/acts/9-30.htm" title="Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.">Acts 9:30</a>, <a href="/acts/21-4.htm" title="And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:4</a>; <a href="/acts/21-7.htm" title="And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.">Acts 21:7</a>; <a href="/context/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge....">Acts 21:16-17</a>): the former in all parts of the book, and indeed more frequently than <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span>, as applied to Christians; the latter four times, <a href="/acts/9-13.htm" title="Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:">Acts 9:13</a>; <a href="/acts/9-32.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda.">Acts 9:32</a>; <a href="/acts/9-41.htm" title="And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.">Acts 9:41</a>, <a href="/acts/26-10.htm" title="Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.">Acts 26:10</a>. But if our Lord gave the charge to His disciples recorded in St. <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>, bidding them make disciples of all the nations, <span class="greekheb">μαθητεύσατε</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="/acts/14-21.htm" title="And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,">Acts 14:21</a> for the same word), then we can understand that the term would still be retained, as it was so closely associated with the last charge of the Master, whilst a mutual discipleship involved a mutual brotherhood (<a href="/matthew/23-8.htm" title="But be not you called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all you are brothers.">Matthew 23:8</a>). St. Paul in his Epistles would be addressing those who enjoyed through Christ a common share with himself in a holy fellowship and calling, and whom he would therefore address not as <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span> but as <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἅφιοι</span>. They were still <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span>, yet not of man but of the Lord (only in one passage in Acts, and that a doubtful one, <a href="/acts/9-43.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.">Acts 9:43</a>, is the word <span class="greekheb">μαθηταί</span> or <span class="greekheb">μαθητής</span> used of any human teacher), and the word was still true of them with that significance, and is still used up to a period subsequent (we may well believe) to the writing of several of Paul’s Epistles, <a href="/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>. How the word left its impress upon the thought of the Church, in the claim of the disciple to be as his Master, is touchingly evidenced by the expressions of St. Ign., <span class="ital">Ephes.</span> i. 2; <span class="ital">Magn.</span>, ix., 2; <span class="ital">Rom.</span> iv. 2; <span class="ital">Tral.</span>, v., 2 (St. Polyc., <span class="ital">Martyr</span>, xvii., 3, where the word is applied to the martyrs as disciples of the Lord, and the prayer is offered: <span class="greekheb">ὧν γένοιτο καὶ ἡμᾶς συγκοινωνούς τε καὶ συμμαθητάς γενέσθαι</span>).—<span class="greekheb">γογγυσμὸς</span> and <span class="greekheb">γογγύζειν</span> are both used by St. Luke (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/5-30.htm" title="But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?">Luke 5:30</a>), by St. John, and also by St. Paul, <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm" title="Do all things without murmurings and disputings:">Php 2:14</a>, and <a href="/1_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>, the noun also by St. Peter, <a href="/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a>; <a href="/acts/1-9.htm" title="And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.">Acts 1:9</a>.

I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.">Numbers 14:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">γογγυσμός</span> is also found in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/1-10.htm" title="For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid.">Wis 1:10</a>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/46-7.htm" title="In the time of Moses also he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephunne, in that they withstood the congregation, and withheld the people from sin, and appeased the wicked murmuring.">Sir 46:7</a>, with reference to <a href="/context/numbers/14-26.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,...">Numbers 14:26-27</a>, and twice in Psalms of Solomon <a href="/acts/5-15.htm" title="So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.">Acts 5:15</a>, <a href="/acts/16-11.htm" title="Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;">Acts 16:11</a>. In Attic Greek <span class="greekheb">τονθυρισμός</span> would be used (so <span class="greekheb">τονθρίζω</span> and <span class="greekheb">τονθυρίζω</span>). Phrynichus brands the other forms as Ionian, but Dr. Kennedy maintains that <span class="greekheb">γογγυσμός</span> and <span class="greekheb">γογγύζειν</span> from their frequent use in the LXX are rather to be classed amongst “vernacular terms” long continued in the speech of the people, from which the LXX drew. Both words are probably onomatopoetic.—Kennedy, <span class="ital">Sources of N. T. Greek</span>, pp. 38–40, 72, 73, 76; see also Rutherford, <span class="ital">New Phrynichus</span>, p. 463; Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, p. 106. Here the word refers rather to <span class="ital">indignatio clandestina</span>, not to an open murmuring.—<span class="greekheb">Ἑλληνιστῶν</span>. The meaning of the term, which was a matter of conjecture in St. Chrysostom’s day, cannot be said to be decided now (Hort, <span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 48). The verb <span class="greekheb">Ἑλληνίζειν</span>, to speak Greek (Xen., <span class="ital">Anab.</span>, vii., 3, 25), helps us reasonably to define it as a Greek-speaking Jew (so also Holtzmann and Wendt). The term occurs again in <a href="/acts/9-29.htm" title="And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.">Acts 9:29</a> (and <a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>? see <span class="ital">in loco</span>), and includes those Jews who had settled in Greek-speaking countries, who spoke the common Greek dialect in place of the vernacular Aramaic current in Palestine, and who would be more or less acquainted with Greek habits of life and education. They were therefore a class distinguished not by descent but by language. This word “Grecians” (A.V.) was introduced to distinguish them from the Greeks by race, but the rendering “Grecian Jews” (R.V.) makes the distinction much plainer. Thus in the Dispersion “the cultured Jew was not only a Jew but a Greek as well”; he would be obliged from force of circumstances to adapt himself to his surroundings more or less, but, even in the more educated, the original Jewish element still predominated in his character; and if this was true of the higher it was still more true of the lower classes amongst the Hellenists—no adoption of the Greek language as their mode of speech, no separation of distance from the Holy City, no defections in their observances of the law, or the surrender as unessential of points which the Pharisees deemed vital, could make them forget that they were members of the Commonwealth of Israel, that Palestine was their home, and the Temple their pride, see B.D.2, “Hellenist,” Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. ii., p. 282, E.T.; Hamburger, <span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie des Judentums</span>, ii., 3, “Griechenthum”. But bearing this description in mind, we can the more easily understand the conflict with Stephen, and his treatment by those who were probably his fellow-Hellenists. If as a cultured Hellenist St. Stephen’s sympathies were wider and his outlook less narrow than that of the orthodox Jew, or of the less educated type of Hellenist, such a man, who died as St. Stephen died with the prayer of Jesus on his lips (see Feine’s remarks), must have so lived in the spirit of his Master’s teaching as to realise that in His Kingdom the old order would change and give place to new. But the same considerations help us to understand the fury aroused by St. Stephen’s attitude, and it is not difficult to imagine the fanatical rage of a people who had nearly risen in insurrection because Pilate had placed in his palace at Jerusalem some gilt shields inscribed with the names of heathen gods, against one who without the power of Pilate appeared to advocate a change of the customs which Moses had delivered (see Nösgen, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 69).—<span class="greekheb">Ἑβραῖοι</span>—in W.H[189] with smooth breathing, see W.H[190], Introduction, p. 313, and Winer-Schmiedel, p. 40; here those Jews in Palestine who spoke Aramaic; in the Church at Jerusalem they would probably form a considerable majority, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Php 3:5</a>, and Lightfoot’s note. In the N.T. <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖος</span> is opposed to <span class="greekheb">Ἕλλην</span> (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>), and <span class="greekheb">Ἑβραῖος</span> to <span class="greekheb">Ἑλληνιστής</span>, <a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>. In the former case the contrast lies in the difference of race and religion; in the latter in the difference of customs and language. A man might be called <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαῖος</span>, but he would not be <span class="greekheb">Ἑβραῖος</span> in the N.T. sense unless he retained in speech the Aramaic tongue; the distinction was therefore drawn on the side of language, a distinction which still survives in our way of speaking of the <span class="ital">Jewish</span> nation, but of the <span class="ital">Hebrew</span> tongue. See Trench, <span class="ital">Synonyms</span>, i., p. 156 ff. In the two other passages in which <span class="greekheb">Ἑβρ</span>. is used, <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Php 3:5</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.">2 Corinthians 11:22</a>, whatever difficulties surround them, it is probable that the distinctive force of the word as explained above is implied. But as <span class="ital">within</span> the nation, the distinction is not recognised by later Christian writers, and that it finds no place at all in Jewish writers like Philo and Josephus, or in Greek authors like Plutarch and Pausanias (Trench, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>).—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> St. <a href="/luke/5-30.htm" title="But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?">Luke 5:30</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγόγγυζον πρὸς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">παρεθεωροῦντο</span>: not found elsewhere in N.T. and not in LXX, but used in this sense in Dem. (also by Diodorus and Dion. Hal.) = <span class="greekheb">παρορᾶν</span>, Attic: imperfect, denoting that the neglect had been going on for some time; how the neglect had arisen we are not told—there is no reason to suppose that there had been previously Palestinian deacons (so Blass in [191], critical notes), for the introduction of such a class of deacons, as Hilgenfeld notes, is something quite new, and does not arise out of anything previously said, although it would seem that in the rapidly growing numbers of the Church the Hebrew Christians regarded their Hellenist fellow-Christians as having only a secondary claim on their care. Possibly the supply for the Hellenists fell short, simply because the Hebrews were already in possession. The Church had been composed first of Galileans and native Jews resident in Jerusalem, and then there was added a wider circle—Jews of the Dispersion. It is possible to interpret the incident as an indication of what would happen as the feeling between Jew and Hellenist became more bitter, but it is difficult to believe that the Apostles, who shared with St. James of Jerusalem the belief that <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> consisted in visiting the fatherless and widows in their affliction, could have acted in a spirit of partiality, so that the neglect, if it was due to them, could be attributed to anything else than to their ignorance of the greatness of the need.—<span class="greekheb">διακονίᾳ</span>, see below on <a href="/acts/6-2.htm" title="Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.">Acts 6:2</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καθημερινῇ</span>: not found elsewhere in N.T. or in LXX, only in <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/12-15.htm" title="So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all her woman's attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on the ground for her over against Holofernes, which she had received of Bagoas for her daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.">Jdt 12:15</a>. It is a word only used in Hellenistic Greek, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, iii., 10, 1; but it may be noted that it is also a word frequently employed by medical writers of a class of fevers, etc. See instances in Hobart, pp. 134, 135, and also in Wetstein, <span class="ital">in loco</span>.—<span class="greekheb">αἱ χῆραι αὐτῶν</span>: not merely a generic term for the poor and needy—under the Mosaic dispensation no legal provision was made for widows, but they would not only receive the privileges belonging to other distressed classes, but also specific regulations protected them—they were commended to the care of the community, and their oppression and neglect were strongly condemned—it is quite possible that the Hellenistic widows had previously been helped from the Temple Treasury, but that now, on their joining the Christian community, this help had ceased.

In either case they had embraced Christianity as Jews, for as yet the Gospel had been preached to Jews only. That provision was made for a Greek service for the foreign Jews, we may see from T. Jerus. <span class="ital">Sotah</span> vii. 1 (Gemara), “Rabbi Levi, the son of Hithah, went to Cæsarea, and heard the voice of the people saying the <span class="ital">Shema</span> (the name given to the Hebrew confession ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, Jehovah is one,’ from its first word) in Hellenistic. He desired to prevent them.

This word <span class="ital">diakonia</span> has, however, caused the name of <span class="ital">deacons</span> to be attached to these officers, whose appointment was at first made that they might have care of and distribute the funds contributed by the rich members for the relief of the needy. We can nevertheless see from St Stephen’s work that the labours of the seven were not confined to these duties alone, for he is a mighty preacher and endued with gifts of the Holy Ghost in the same way as the Apostles. It is deserving of notice that, before we find any special arrangements made for what we now understand by “divine service,” the regulation of the relief of those in need had become so engrossing a part of the duty of the twelve as to have thrust aside in some degree the prayers and ministration of the word, which were especially their charge. In these early days they appear to have acted according to St James’ teaching (<a href="/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">James 1:27</a>), “Pure religion (<span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span>) and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration....">Acts 6:1-7</a></span>.

Now, therefore, the historian of the Church’s progress turns to deal with other events and different persons, because he has to tell of a persecution which caused Christian missionaries to go forth for the next stage of the work, the spread of the faith through Judæa and Samaria (<a href="/acts/8-1.htm" title="And Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.">Acts 8:1</a>). The means which God employed for this end are not such as an inventor in the second century would have been likely to hit upon, nor such as any writer who merely desired to magnify the Apostles would have adopted. A system for the more effectual relief of the widows among the congregation is devised, and an outburst of popular rage, causing the death of one of the dispensers of the relief-funds, also disperses the greater part of the Church of Jerusalem. A person who was free to choose (as an inventor would have been) would scarcely have selected one of the seven deacons for the first Christian martyr, and have left the Apostles out of sight, while giving the history of Stephen. The choice of such a writer would have surely fallen upon one of the twelve to be the first to die for the faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πληθυνόντων</span>) viz. <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span> [multiplying themselves].

We learn incidentally by this phrase that one of the earliest Christian institutions was an order of widows, who were maintained at the common cost.

"Grecians" might easily be understood of Greeks in general. The word Hellenists denotes Jews, not Greeks, but Jews who spoke Greek. The contact of Jews with Greeks was first effected by the conquests of Alexander. He settled eight thousand Jews in the Thebais, and the Jews formed a third of the population of his new city of Alexandria. From Egypt they gradually spread along the whole Mediterranean coast of Africa. They were removed by Seleucus Nicator from Babylonia, by thousands, to Antioch and Seleucia, and under the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes scattered themselves through Asia Minor, Greece, Macedonia, and the Aegean islands. The vast majority of them adopted the Greek language, and forgot the Aramaic dialect which had been their language since the Captivity. The word is used but twice in the New Testament - here and <a href="/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29</a> - and, in both cases, of Jews who had embraced Christianity, but who spoke Greek and used the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the original Hebrew or the Chaldaic targum or paraphrase. The word &#x395;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, Greek, which is very common in the New Testament, is used in antithesis, either to "Barbarians" or to "Jews." In the former case it means all nations which spoke the Greek language (see <a href="/acts/18-17.htm">Acts 18:17</a>; <a href="/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). In the latter it is equivalent to Gentiles (see <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-3.htm">Galatians 2:3</a>). Hence, in either case, it is wholly different from Hellenist.<p>Hebrews<p>Hebrew is the proper antithesis to Hellenist. A man was &#x399;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a Jew, who traced his descent from Jacob, and conformed to the religion of his fathers. He might speak Greek and be a Hellenist. He was &#x395;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, a Hebrew, only as he spoke Hebrew and retained Hebrew customs. The distinction between Hebrew and Hellenist was a distinction within the Jewish nation, and not between it and other nations. Thus Paul calls himself a Hebrew of Hebrews; i.e., a Hebrew and of Hebrew parents (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>; compare <a href="/2_corinthians/11-22.htm">2 Corinthians 11:22</a>).<p>Were neglected (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
