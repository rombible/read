Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God. Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work, and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake, this precious faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Took him by the hand - As an expression of kindness and civility.

There are several reasons given of this great civility here used, as the chief captain’s naturally meek temper; or his policy to satisfy for the injury he had done to Paul, in binding him, being a Roman; nay, some think that he, as well as Felix the governor, hoped for money to be given unto him, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/24-26.htm" title="He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: why he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.">Acts 24:26</a></span>: but all these are but guesses.

Some have thought that the reason of this was, that he expected that the young man had brought him a present in his hand, from Paul; but this is to represent him as a sordid mercenary man, which ought not to be said, without sufficient proof; rather this should be considered as an instance of civility and humanity, and what showed him to be a man of breeding and good manners; and might be done partly out of respect to Paul, and partly to encourage the young man to use freedom in the account he was about to give him: <p>and went with him aside privately; concluding by his coming from Paul, and perceiving by the account of the centurion, that he had a secret to communicate to him; wherefore it was acting a wise and prudent part to take him into a private room, and hear what he had to say: <p>and asked him, what is that thou hast to tell me? thereby giving the young man an opportunity, and encouraging him to relate the secret to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/23.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/23-19.htm" title="Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that you have to tell me?">Acts 23:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλαβ</span>.: “ut fiduciam adolescentis confirmaret,” Bengel, so Knabenbauer; on <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλ</span>. see note, <a href="/acts/17-19.htm" title="And they took him, and brought him to Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you speak, is?">Acts 17:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/8-54.htm" title="And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.">Luke 8:54</a>, Winer-Moulton, xxx. 8 d; see Calvin’s note on the <span class="ital">humanitas</span> (as he calls it) of the centurion in thus receiving the young man.—<span class="greekheb">ἀναχ</span>.: used also in <a href="/acts/26-31.htm" title="And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.">Acts 26:31</a>, but not by Luke in his Gospel, although found in the other Evangelists.—<span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἰδίαν ἐπυν</span>.: “asked him privately,” R.V., as suggested by the order of the Greek.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">the chief captain took him by the hand</span>] The messenger from a Roman citizen was entitled to some consideration, and the action of the chief captain is meant to encourage the young man. The chief captain would naturally incline to favour Paul after his conversation with him, rather than his Jewish accusers.
