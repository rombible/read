The building had probably been intended by Herod for use as a royal residence, and was now used by the Roman procurator for himself and his troops. The Apostle had there a second experience of the life of a prætorium. At Rome he does not appear to have been in the prætorium, though the circumstances of his imprisonment brought him into contact with the soldiers who were quartered there. (Comp.

The word used here denoted formerly "the tent of the Roman praetor"; and since that was the place where justice was administered, it came to be applied to "halls (courts) of justice." This had been raised probably by Herod the Great as his palace, or as a place for administering justice. It is probable, also, that prisons, or places of security, would be attached to such places. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35.

Here it is probably the name of the palace which Herod had erected for himself, and which now was used as the governor’s residence. It seems (from <a href="/context/acts/24-24.htm" title="And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ....">Acts 24:24-26</a>) that it was close to the quarters of Felix himself, and that Paul could speedily be sent for.

The verb employed in the sentence only implies that Paul was to be taken care of; he was not kept in close imprisonment. “A Roman and uncondemned” would not be subject to needless indignities, when his accusers were Jews who could make no such claim for consideration.
