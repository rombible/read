Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God. Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work, and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake, this precious faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which had made this conspiracy - This oath &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  suno&#772;mosian, this agreement, or compact.
