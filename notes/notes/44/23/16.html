The fact that St. Paul lodged with Mnason, as far as it goes, suggests the probability that neither the sister nor the nephew resided permanently in Jerusalem. We do not even know whether they were members of the Christian society, though this may, perhaps, be inferred from the eagerness of the son to save his uncle from the danger which he know to be imminent. We find that St. Paul had kinsmen at Rome (<a href="/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>; <a href="/romans/16-11.htm" title="Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.">Romans 16:11</a>). Was this nephew one of them who had come to Jerusalem to keep the feast, and heard the plot talked of (it is difficult to keep a secret in which forty men are sharers) in the caravanserai where he and other pilgrims lodged? We see, from the fact thus stated, that St. Paul, though in custody, was allowed to hold free communication with his friends. This, perhaps, accounts for the fulness with which the whole history is given. The writer of the Acts had come up with the Apostle, and was not likely to desert his friend if he could possibly gain access to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/23-16.htm" title="And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul....">Acts 23:16-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Paul’s sister’s son heard, </span>&c. — How privately soever this business was contrived, the providence of God so ordered it, that, for the deliverance of his faithful servant from this inhuman and bloody conspiracy, it came to the ears of Paul’s nephew; who <span class="ital">went and entered into the castle </span>— Where, as has been before observed, Paul now lay confined; <span class="ital">and told </span>him the whole matter. <span class="ital">Then Paul called one of the centurions </span>— Who commanded part of the cohort under the tribune; <span class="ital">and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain — </span>Thus we see that Paul, though he had an express promise of it from Christ, did not neglect any proper means of safety. <span class="ital">The chief captain took him by the hand </span>— In a mild, condescending way; <span class="ital">and went aside privately </span>— Where none could overhear them speaking; <span class="ital">and asked what </span>he had <span class="ital">to tell </span>him — Lysias seems to have conducted this whole affair with great integrity, humanity, and prudence. <span class="ital">So the chief captain </span>— Having received the information which the young man had to give; <span class="ital">let </span>him <span class="ital">depart, </span>charging <span class="ital">him to tell no man </span>what things they were that he had communicated.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:12-24 False religious principles, adopted by carnal men, urge on to such wickedness, as human nature would hardly be supposed capable of. Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God.
