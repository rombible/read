It first occurs in Theophylactus Simocatta,[150] and then again in the tenth century in Constant. Porphyr. <span class="ital">Themat</span>. i. 1 (see Wetstein). At all events, it must denote some kind of force under the command of the tribune, and that a light-armed infantry, as the <span class="greekheb">δεξιολ</span>. are distinguished both from the cavalry and from the <span class="greekheb">στρατιώτ</span>. That they were infantry, their great number also proves. It is safest to regard them as a peculiar kind of the light troops called <span class="ital">rorarii</span> or <span class="ital">velites</span>, and that either as <span class="ital">jaculatores</span> (javelin-throwers, Liv. <a href="/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a>) or <span class="ital">funditores</span> (slingers), for in Constant. Porphyr. (<span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ λεγόμενοι τουρμάρχαι εἰς ὑπουργίαν τῶν στρατηγῶν ἐτάχθησαν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Σημαίνει δὲ τοιοῦτον ἀξίωμα τὸν ἔχοντα ὑφʼ ἑαυτὸν στρατιώτας τοξοφόρους πεντακοσίους</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ πελταστὰς τριακοσίους</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ δεξιολάβους ἑκατόν</span>) they are expressly distinguished from the <span class="ital">sagittarii</span>, or bowmen (<span class="greekheb">τοξοφόρ</span>.), and from the targeteers, the <span class="ital">peltastae</span> (or <span class="ital">cetrati</span>, see Liv. xxxi. 36). Detailed grounds are wanting for a more definite decision.[151] The name <span class="greekheb">δεξιολ</span>. (<span class="ital">those who grasp with the right hand</span>) is very naturally explained from their kind of weapon, which was restricted in its use to the right hand (it was otherwise with the heavy-armed troops, and also with the bowmen and peltastae). This word has frequently been explained (following Suidas: <span class="greekheb">παραφύλακες</span>) <span class="ital">halberdiers, life guardsmen</span> (who protect the right side of the commander), to which, perhaps, the translation of the <span class="ital">Vulgate</span> (also Ath. and Sahidic): <span class="ital">lancearios</span> (from the spear which the halberdiers carried), is to be referred. Already the Coptic and Syriac p. translate <span class="ital">stipatores</span>. Meursius (in the <span class="ital">Glossar</span>.), on the other hand: <span class="ital">military lictors</span> (“Manum nimirum injiciebant maleficis”). But even apart from the passages of Theophyl. Simocatta, and Constant. Porphyr., of whom the latter particularly mentions the <span class="greekheb">δεξιολ</span>. alongside of the purely light-armed soldiers, and indeed alongside of mere ordinary soldiers: the great number of them is decisive against both views. For that the commander of a cohort should have had a body-guard, of which he could furnish two hundred men for the escort of a prisoner, is just as improbable, as that he should have had as many lictors at his disposal. On the whole, then, the reading <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΕΞΙΟΒΌΛΟΥς</span></span></span> in A (Syr. <span class="ital">jaculantes dextra</span>; Erp. <span class="ital">jaculatores</span>), approved by Grotius and Valckenaer, is to be considered as a <span class="ital">correct</span> interpretation, whether they be understood to be javelin-throwers or slingers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τρίτης ὥρας τῆς νυκτός</span>] <span class="ital">from this time</span> (about nine in the evening) they were to have this force in readiness, because the convoy was to start, for the sake of the greatest possible security from the Jews, at the time of darkness and of the first sleep.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[150] In the seventh century. The passage in question, v. 1, is as follows: <span class="greekheb">προστάττει δὲ καὶ δεξιολάβοις δυνάμεσιν ἰχνηλατεῖν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἀτραποὺς πάσας κατασφαλίζεσθαι</span>. From this it only follows that they must have been a <span class="ital">light-armed</span> force.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[151] Ewald, p. 577, now explains it from <span class="greekheb">λαβή</span>, <span class="ital">grasp of the sword</span>; holding that they were <span class="ital">spiculatores cum lanceis</span> (Sueton. <span class="ital">Claud</span>. 35); and that they carried their sword, not on the left, but on the <span class="ital">right</span>. But we do not see why this was necessary for the sake of using their spears by the right hand. The sword on the left side would, indeed, have been least a hindrance to them in the use of the spear. Earlier, Ewald took them to be <span class="ital">slingers</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/23.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/23-23.htm" title="And he called to him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen three score and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;">Acts 23:23</a>.

The word only occurs elsewhere twice, and that in later Greek literature of the seventh and tenth century (see references in Grimm-Thayer, <span class="ital">sub v.</span>, and Meyer—Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>), where they are distinguished from the <span class="greekheb">τοξοφόροι</span> and <span class="greekheb">πελτασταί</span>. Probably from <span class="greekheb">δεξιός</span> and <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνω</span>, grasping their weapons by the right hand, so here of those who carried their light weapon, a lance, in their right hand, Vulgate, <span class="ital">lancearios</span>. This is more probable than the derivation from <span class="greekheb">λαβή</span>, a sword-hilt, as if the word referred to <span class="ital">spiculatores cum lanceis</span>, who wore their swords fastened not on the left but on the right (so Ewald). Still more fanciful is the derivation of Egli who accented thus <span class="greekheb">δεξιολάβοι</span>, and took the word to refer to those who were unable to use the right hand, <a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Jdg 3:15</a>; <a href="/judges/20-16.htm" title="Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left handed; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.">Jdg 20:16</a>, so “lefthanded” slingers. Others interpret as if the word meant military lictors who guarded captives bound by the right hand, but their large number here seems to conflict with such an interpretation (Grimm-Thayer), see the full notes of Meyer—Wendt, 1888, 1899, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> Renan, <span class="ital">Saint Paul</span>, p. 532, Overbeck for various interpretations, and Winer-Schmiedel, p. 69. A reads <span class="greekheb">δεξιοβόλους</span> (Syr.

Here there would seem to be two turmae because a turma consisted of thirty-three men - here possibly of thirty-five. <span class="cmt_word">Spearmen</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. This word occurs nowhere else in Scripture or in any ancient Greek author. It is first found in" Theophylactus Simocatta, in the seventh century, and then again in the tenth century in Constantine Porphyrogenitus" (Meyer). It seems most probable that it was the name of some particular kind of light infantry. But it is not easy to explain the etymology. Perhaps they were a kind of skirmishers thrown out on a march to protect the flanks of an army; as Plutarch speaks of javelin-men and slingers being placed to guard, not only the rear, but also the flanks of the army on the march (Steph., 'Thesaur.,' under <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). "Holding or taking the right" might be the force of the compound, somewhat after the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; which agrees with the explanations of Phavorinus <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and with that of Beza, "Qui alicui dextrum latus [meaning simply <span class="accented">latus</span>] munit." Only, instead of the improbable notion of these men being a body-guard of the tribune - which their number makes impossible - it should be understood of the troops which protect the flank of an army on the march. Other improbable explanations are that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means the soldier to whom the right hand of prisoners was fastened, or those who grasp with the right hand their weapon, the lance or javelin. The object of Lysias in sending so large a force was to guard against the possibility of a rescue in the feverish and excited state of the Jewish mind. And no doubt one reason for sending Paul away was his dread of a Jewish riot. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Soldiers (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Heavy-armed footmen: legionaries.<p>Spearmen (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in New Testament, and not in classical Greek.

Some explain it as those who take the right side of the prisoners whom they have in charge; others, those who grasp (their weapon) with the right hand; others, again, those who hold (a second horse) by the right hand. They are here distinguished from the heavy-armed legionaries and the cavalry. They were probably light-armed troops, javelin-throwers or slingers. One of the principal manuscripts reads &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; "those who throw with the right hand." </body></html>
