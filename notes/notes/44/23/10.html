He, and the Sadducees generally, would now be able to assume the position of being more devoted defenders of the Law and of the Temple than the Pharisees themselves. The fear of the chiliarch was naturally heightened by his knowledge that he was responsible for the life of a Roman citizen. In the barracks of the fortress, as before, probably in the self-same guardroom as that which had witnessed our Lord’s sufferings at the hands of Pilate’s soldiers, the prisoner would at least be in safety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/23-10.htm" title="And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle....">Acts 23:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when there arose a great dissension </span>— Some of them urging that he ought to be set at liberty, while others eagerly insisted on his condemnation; <span class="ital">the chief captain, fearing </span>— On being informed of their disorderly proceedings; <span class="ital">lest he should be pulled in pieces of them </span>— Amidst the tumult; <span class="ital">commanded </span>a party of <span class="ital">soldiers to go down — </span>From the garrison; <span class="ital">to take him by force from among them </span>— Out of that apartment in the temple where he had ordered them to meet; <span class="ital">and to bring him into the castle Antonia </span>— “What must this heathen have thought of the worshippers of JEHOVAH, when he saw this assembly of chief priests, learned scribes, and rulers of Israel, forgetful of what became their rank, profession, and sacred character; and carried away by such unbridled rage, in their religious contests, as the Roman senators and magistrates, or principal persons, would have been ashamed of, even in their eager competition for authority and pre-eminence?” — Scott. <span class="ital">And the night following the Lord stood by him </span>— Appeared to him in a vision; <span class="ital">And said, Be of good cheer, Paul </span>— As he laboured under singular distresses and persecutions, so he was favoured with extraordinary assurances of the divine assistance. <span class="ital">For as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem </span>— And all the malice of the Jews has not prevented thee from faithfully discharging thy commission; <span class="ital">so must thou bear witness also at Rome </span>— Thus God now, in due time, confirms what Paul had before purposed in spirit, <a href="/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>.

Paul shall testify at Rome; therefore he shall come to Rome; therefore he shall escape the Jews, the sea, and the viper. He shall be brought safe through all intervening obstacles, dangers, and distresses, that he may bear testimony to the Romans.

The Sadducees were no friends to the Scripture or Divine revelation; they denied a future state; they had neither hope of eternal happiness, nor dread of eternal misery. When called in question for his being a Christian, Paul might truly say he was called in question for the hope of the resurrection of the dead. It was justifiable in him, by this profession of his opinion on that disputed point, to draw off the Pharisees from persecuting him, and to lead them to protect him from this unlawful violence. How easily can God defend his own cause! Though the Jews seemed to be perfectly agreed in their conspiracy against religion, yet they were influenced by very different motives. There is no true friendship among the wicked, and in a moment, and with the utmost ease, God can turn their union into open enmity. Divine consolations stood Paul in the most stead; the chief captain rescued him out of the hands of cruel men, but the event he could not tell. Whoever is against us, we need not fear, if the Lord stand by us. It is the will of Christ, that his servants who are faithful, should be always cheerful. He might think he should never see Rome; but God tells him, even in that he should be gratified, since he desired to go there only for the honour of Christ, and to do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A great dissension - A great tumult, excitement, or controversy.<p>Into the castle - See the notes on <a href="/acts/21-34.htm">Acts 21:34</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled to pieces &#8230; commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force, &c.&#8212;This shows that the commandant was not himself present, and further, that instead of the Sanhedrim trying the cause, the proceedings quickly consisted in the one party attempting to seize the prisoner, and the other to protect him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A great dissension:</span> feuds about pretended religion are usually among all men very sharp, because their opinions, being the issues of their own brains, are more beloved than their children, the fruit of their bodies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Commanded the soldiers to go down; </span> from the fort or castle, unto which there was an ascent or stair, to go up and down by. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when there arose a great dissension,....
