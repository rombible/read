The comparative implies a reference to an average standard. Felix was too well-informed to yield any answer to the declamatory statements of Tertullus. He saw that the prisoner was no common <span class= "ital">Sicarius, </span>or leader of sedition. He knew something as to the life of the sect of Nazarenes. That knowledge may well have been acquired either at Jerusalem, which the procurator would naturally visit at the great festivals and other occasions, or at Cæsarea, where, as we know, Philip the Evangelist had, some twenty-five years before, founded a Christian community, which included among its members Cornelius and other Roman soldiers, or even, we may add, in the imperial capital itself. His wife Drusilla, also, the daughter of Herod Agrippa I., may have contributed something to his knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">I will know the uttermost of your matter.</span>—Leaving the general attack on the “way” of the Nazarenes, or Christians, Felix proposes to inquire into the actual circumstances of the case brought before him. It is remarkable that this adjournment leads to an indefinite postponement. Possibly the accusers felt that they had fired their last shot in the speech of Tertullus, and, seeing that that had failed, thought that the judge had made up his mind against them, and withdrew from the prosecution. The detention of the prisoner under such circumstances was only too common an incident in the provincial administration of justice in the Roman empire, as it has since been in other corrupt or ill-governed states.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter....">Acts 24:22-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Felix heard these things — </span>Namely, the orator’s accusation and the prisoner’s defence; <span class="ital">having more perfect knowledge of that way </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ακριβεστερον ειδως τα περι της οδου</span>, <span class="ital">having known more perfectly the things concerning the way, </span>namely, the way of worship, mentioned by Paul, (<a href="/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>,) or a more perfect knowledge of Jesus and his disciples than had been given him by the high-priest, the elders, and their orator; and knowing it not to be so mischievous a thing as these accusers suggested; <span class="ital">he deferred them </span>— This seems to be that interpretation of the clause which best accords with the original. Beza, Grotius, and many others, however, take the meaning of the clause to be, that Felix “would take an opportunity of being more particularly informed of this sect, and of its aspect on the public tranquillity; and that when Lysias should come down and give him an account of what he had observed concerning it, as well as of the circumstances attending Paul’s apprehension, &c., he would determine the affair.” “But it seems to me evident,” says Dr. Whitby, “that the original words cannot admit of this explication, namely, that Felix deferred them that he might have a more exact knowledge of Christianity; but that, having his residence at Cesarea, where Cornelius the centurion and his friends were converted, where Philip the evangelist dwelt, and where there were many disciples, (<a href="/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>; <a href="/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>,) he had thus become acquainted with the way of Christianity.” But though Felix did not find any crime proved against Paul, yet he did not acquit him, because he was afraid of displeasing the Jews. Being, however, fully convinced (as it is evident he was) of his innocence, he ordered that he should not be confined too closely; but that his acquaintance should be allowed to visit him, or minister unto him; a liberty which we may be sure the brethren of Cesarea made good use of during his long imprisonment in that city.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:22-27 The apostle reasoned concerning the nature and obligations of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come; thus showing the oppressive judge and his profligate mistress, their need of repentance, forgiveness, and of the grace of the gospel. Justice respects our conduct in life, particularly in reference to others; temperance, the state and government of our souls, in reference to God. He who does not exercise himself in these, has neither the form nor the power of godliness, and must be overwhelmed with the Divine wrath in the day of God's appearing. A prospect of the judgment to come, is enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble. Felix trembled, but that was all. Many are startled by the word of God, who are not changed by it. Many fear the consequences of sin, yet continue in the love and practice of sin. In the affairs of our souls, delays are dangerous. Felix put off this matter to a more convenient season, but we do not find that the more convenient season ever came. Behold now is the accepted time; hear the voice of the Lord to-day. He was in haste to turn from hearing the truth. Was any business more urgent than for him to reform his conduct, or more important than the salvation of his soul! Sinners often start up like a man roused from his sleep by a loud noise, but soon sink again into their usual drowsiness. Be not deceived by occasional appearances of religion in ourselves or in others. Above all, let us not trifle with the word of God. Do we expect that as we advance in life our hearts will grow softer, or that the influence of the world will decline? Are we not at this moment in danger of being lost for ever? Now is the day of salvation; tomorrow may be too late.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having more perfect knowledge of that way - Our translation of this verse is very obscure, and critics are divided about the proper interpretation of the original. Many (Erasmus, Luther, Michaelis, Morus, etc.) render it, "Although he had a more perfect knowledge of the Christian doctrine than Paul's accusers had, yet he deferred the hearing of the cause until Lysias had come down." They observe that he might have obtained this knowledge not only from the letter of Lysias, but from public rumour, as there were doubtless Christians at Caesarea. They suppose that he deferred the cause either with the hope of receiving a bribe from Paul (compare <a href="/acts/24-26.htm">Acts 24:26</a>), or to gratify the Jews with his being longer detained as a prisoner. Others, among whom are Beza, Grotius, Rosenmuller, and Doddridge, suppose that it should be rendered, "He deferred them, and said, after I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias has come down, I will hear the cause." This is doubtless the true interpretation of the passage, and it is rendered more probable by the fact that Felix sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith of Christ <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>, evidently with the design to make himself better acquainted with the charges against him, and the nature of his belief.<p>Of that way - Of the Christian religion.

Certainly, so far as recorded, neither Lysias nor any other parties appeared again in the case.

His causing a sedition: as to the first, Felix would not determine it till he had had better information about those things which St. Paul was accused for to hold.

He pronounced until further investigation the <span class="ital">non liquet</span> (Cic. <span class="ital">Cluent</span>. 28, Brisson. <span class="ital">formul</span>.), and for the time being <span class="ital">adjourned</span> the settlement of the accusation. See on the judicial term <span class="greekheb">ἀναβάλλεσθαι</span> (Dem. 1042 ult.), Wetstein, and Kypke, II. p. 123 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀκριβέστερον εἰδὼς τὰ περὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ</span>] The only correct interpretation is: <span class="ital">because he knew more exactly what referred to Christianity</span> (<a href="/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>). As Felix had been procurator for more than six years, and as Christianity was diffused everywhere in Judaea, even in Caesarea itself, it was natural that he should have an <span class="greekheb">ἀκριβέστερον</span> knowledge of the circumstances of that religion than was given to him in the present discussion; therefore he considered it the most fitting course to leave the matter still in suspense. In doing so he prudently satisfied, on the one hand, his regard for the favour of the Jews (comp. <a href="/acts/24-27.htm" title="But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.">Acts 24:27</a>) by not giving Paul his liberty; while, on the other hand, he satisfied his better intelligence about Christianity, by which, notwithstanding his badness in other respects, he felt himself precluded from pleasing the Jews and condemning the apostle. This connection, which in essentials the Vulgate, Chrysostom, Erasmus, Luther, Castalio, Wolf, and others (comp. Bengel: “consilia dilatoria, tuta mundo in rebus divinis”) have expressed, has been often mistaken. Beza and Grotius, followed by Rosenmüller, Heinrichs, and Ewald, regard <span class="greekheb">ἀκριβέστερον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὁδοῦ</span> as part of the speech of Felix: “Ubi exactius didicero, quid sit de hac secta, et ubi Lysias venerit, causam illam terminabo” (Grotius). But so late a bringing in of the <span class="greekheb">εἰπών</span> is entirely without precedent in the N.T. (see also Bornemann, and Rosenmüller, <span class="ital">Repert</span>. II. p. 281 f.). Michaelis and Morus resolve <span class="greekheb">εἰδώς</span> by <span class="ital">quamquam</span>; notwithstanding his better knowledge of Christianity, Felix did not release Paul. But this resolution is the less suggested by the relation of the participle to the verb, as afterwards, <a href="/acts/24-23.htm" title="And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come to him.">Acts 24:23</a>, the specially mild treatment of the apostle is expressly stated. According to de Wette (comp. Wetstein), the sense is: “As he needed no further hearing of the accused, and it was only necessary now to hear the tribune.” But the reference to the tribune is only to be regarded as a welcome <span class="ital">pretext</span> and <span class="ital">evasion</span>; an actual hearing of Lysias would have been reported in the sequel of the history. Lastly, Kuinoel erroneously renders: when he had <span class="ital">inquired</span> more exactly, which <span class="greekheb">εἰδώς</span> does not mean.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰ καθʼ ὑμᾶς</span>] <span class="ital">your matters</span>, not: your <span class="ital">misdeeds</span> (so Böttger, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>.

This knowledge, the writer indicates, was the real reason: the reason which Felix alleged was that he required the evidence of Lysias in person. Wendt, Zöckler, Bethge, Nösgen take the words to mean that the address of Paul had offended Felix’s more accurate knowledge, and on this account he put off any decision.

The conversion of Cornelius with his household and friends, men belonging to the dominant Roman power; the work of Philip the evangelist, residing probably for some years at Caesarea, and working among Romans as well as Jews, must have given Felix some knowledge of "the Way." He would learn something, too, both of Judaism and Christianity from Drusilla, his wife (ver. 24, note). <span class="cmt_word">When Lysias...  shall come</span> (see vers. 7, 8, and note). <span class="cmt_word">I will determine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); see above, <a href="/acts/23-15.htm">Acts 23:15</a>, where the verb is in the active voice, and is rendered in the R.V. "to judge." The idea of the word is "to know with discrimination;" and this is the sense it has in medical writers, who use it very frequently; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Galen says, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (quoted by Hobart).
