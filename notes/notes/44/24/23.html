The favourable impression made on Felix is shown by the unusual leniency with which the prisoner was treated. The attribute of “clemency,” on which the orator had complimented Felix, was not altogether dead, but it was shown to the accused and not to the accusers.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:22-27 The apostle reasoned concerning the nature and obligations of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come; thus showing the oppressive judge and his profligate mistress, their need of repentance, forgiveness, and of the grace of the gospel. Justice respects our conduct in life, particularly in reference to others; temperance, the state and government of our souls, in reference to God. He who does not exercise himself in these, has neither the form nor the power of godliness, and must be overwhelmed with the Divine wrath in the day of God's appearing. A prospect of the judgment to come, is enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble. Felix trembled, but that was all. Many are startled by the word of God, who are not changed by it. Many fear the consequences of sin, yet continue in the love and practice of sin. In the affairs of our souls, delays are dangerous. Felix put off this matter to a more convenient season, but we do not find that the more convenient season ever came. Behold now is the accepted time; hear the voice of the Lord to-day. He was in haste to turn from hearing the truth. Was any business more urgent than for him to reform his conduct, or more important than the salvation of his soul! Sinners often start up like a man roused from his sleep by a loud noise, but soon sink again into their usual drowsiness. Be not deceived by occasional appearances of religion in ourselves or in others. Above all, let us not trifle with the word of God. Do we expect that as we advance in life our hearts will grow softer, or that the influence of the world will decline? Are we not at this moment in danger of being lost for ever? Now is the day of salvation; tomorrow may be too late.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he commanded ... - It is evident from this verse that Felix was disposed to show Paul all the favors that were consistent with his safe keeping. He esteemed him to be a persecuted man, and doubtless regarded the charges against him as entirely malicious. What was Felix's motive in this cannot be certainly known. It is not improbable, however, that he detained him:<p>(1) To gratify the Jews by keeping him in custody as if he were guilty, and,<p>(2) That he hoped the friends of Paul would give him money to release him. Perhaps it was for this purpose that he gave orders that his friends should have free access to him, that thus Paul might be furnished with the means of purchasing his freedom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23. having more perfect knowledge of that&#8212;"the"<p>way&#8212;(See on [2106]Ac 19:23; and [2107]Ac 24:14).<p>When Lysias &#8230; shall come &#8230; I will how, &c.&#8212;Felix might have dismissed the case as a tissue of unsupported charges. But if from his interest in the matter he really wished to have the presence of Lysias and others involved, a brief delay was not unworthy of him as a judge. Certainly, so far as recorded, neither Lysias nor any other parties appeared again in the case. Ac 24:23, however, seems to show that at that time his prepossessions in favor of Paul were strong.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To let him have liberty; </span> not so confined as to be kept in a dungeon, or more inward prison; but to have the liberty of the prison, yet so as with a chain about him; as appears, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/26-29.htm" title="And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.">Acts 26:29</a> <a href="/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Acquaintance; </span> relations or disciples; for there was a church at Caesarea, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/10-48.htm" title="And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.

Read (with <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span>) “that he should be kept in charge.” The verb only conveys the idea of safe keeping, not of severe detention, and it is clear that for some reason Felix shewed himself well-disposed towards the Apostle. Either his conscience moved him, or his hope of gain, or perhaps the flattery and compliments of Tertullus had overshot their mark.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and to let him have liberty</span>] Better, “and should have indulgence.” That is, there should be a relaxation of prison rules in his case.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance</span>] In order to join on better with the previous clause, read (with <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span>) “and not to forbid any of his friends.” The original has a word stronger than “acquaintance.” It refers more particularly to such matters as country, home, family and friends, which are specially a man’s <span class="ital">own</span>. Here from our limited knowledge we are only able to think of Philip the Evangelist who would be particularly a friend of St Paul, but he had been more than once before in Cæsarea, and he had no doubt made himself known there as in other places. Those unnamed disciples of Cæsarea (<a href="/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>) would be among those who had a warm interest in St Paul, and it is clear from St Luke’s language that there were friends at hand and ready to visit the Apostle when they were allowed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to minister or come unto him</span>] The best MSS. have no Greek for “or come.” The verb “minister” implies the doing of those services of which a prisoner even under such liberal conditions must ever stand in need. They would be his means of communication with the outer world. And the cupidity of Felix may have suggested that through these friends the means might be supplied for purchasing the Apostle’s release.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/24-23.htm" title="And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come to him.">Acts 24:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τηρεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">that he should be kept</span>) be secured in safety.—<span class="greekheb">ἄνεσιν</span>, <span class="ital">rest</span>) Thus he was able to propagate the Gospel.
