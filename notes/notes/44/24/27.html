Literally, <span class= "ital">When a period of two years was accomplished, Felix received Porcius Festus as his successor.</span> We can, of course, only conjecture how these years were spent. Some writers who maintain the Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews have assigned it to this period: others have supposed that the Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon were written from Cæsarea; but there is no adequate evidence in support of either hypothesis. It is better to confine ourselves to the thought of the Apostle’s patient resignation, learning obedience by the things he suffered—of his intercourse with Philip, and other members of the Church of Cæsarea, as comforting and refreshing to him. We may venture, perhaps, to think of St. Luke, who had come with him to Jerusalem, and who sailed with him from Cæsarea, as not far off from him during his imprisonment. Attention has already been called (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke’s Gospel and to the Acts</span>) to the probable use made by the Evangelist of these opportunities for collecting materials for his two histories.<p>The change of administration was caused by the complaints which the Jews brought against Felix, and which led Nero to recall him. The influence of his brother Pallas availed, however, to save him from any further punishment. His successor, Festus, who came to the province in A.D. 60, died in his second year of office. Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 14, § 1) speaks of him as suppressing the outrages of the robbers who infested the country, and maintaining the tranquility of the province. Felix, with characteristic baseness, sought by his latest act to court the favour of the Jews, and left the Apostle in prison as a set-off against the many charges which were brought against him.<p><span class= "bld">Willing to shew the Jews a pleasure.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">to deposit a favour.</span> The boon conferred was not to be without return.

Justice respects our conduct in life, particularly in reference to others; temperance, the state and government of our souls, in reference to God. He who does not exercise himself in these, has neither the form nor the power of godliness, and must be overwhelmed with the Divine wrath in the day of God's appearing. A prospect of the judgment to come, is enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble. Felix trembled, but that was all. Many are startled by the word of God, who are not changed by it. Many fear the consequences of sin, yet continue in the love and practice of sin. In the affairs of our souls, delays are dangerous. Felix put off this matter to a more convenient season, but we do not find that the more convenient season ever came. Behold now is the accepted time; hear the voice of the Lord to-day. He was in haste to turn from hearing the truth. Was any business more urgent than for him to reform his conduct, or more important than the salvation of his soul! Sinners often start up like a man roused from his sleep by a loud noise, but soon sink again into their usual drowsiness. Be not deceived by occasional appearances of religion in ourselves or in others. Above all, let us not trifle with the word of God. Do we expect that as we advance in life our hearts will grow softer, or that the influence of the world will decline? Are we not at this moment in danger of being lost for ever? Now is the day of salvation; tomorrow may be too late.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But after two years - Paul was unjustly detained during all this time. The hope of Felix seems to have been to weary his patience, and induce him to purchase his freedom.<p>Came into Felix' room - As governor.<p>And Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure - Desirous of pleasing them, even at the expense of justice, This shows the principle on which he acted.<p>Left Paul bound - Left him in custody to the charge of his successor. His object in this was to conciliate the Jews; that is, to secure their favor, and to prevent them, if possible, from accusing him for the evils of his administration before the emperor. The account which Luke gives here coincides remarkably with what Josephus has given. He says that Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix by Nero. He does not, indeed, mention Paul, or say that Felix sought to conciliate the favor of the Jews, but he gives such an account as to make the statement by Luke perfectly consistent with his character while in office. He informs us that Felix was unpopular, and that there was reason to apprehend that the Jews would accuse him before the emperor; and, therefore, the statement in the Acts that he would be willing to show the Jews a favor, is in perfect keeping with his character and circumstances, and is one of those undesigned coincidences which show that the author of the Acts was fully acquainted with the circumstances of the time and that his history is true.<p>The account in Josephus is, that "when Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix by Nero, the principal inhabitants of Caesarea went up to Rome to accuse Felix; and he had been certainly brought to punishment unless Nero had yielded to the importunate solicitations of his brother Palias, who was at that time had in the greatest honor by him" (Antiq., book 20, chapter 8, section 9). The plan of Felix, therefore, in suppressing the enmity of the Jews, and conciliating their favor by injustice to Paul, did not succeed, and is one of those instances, so numerous in the world, where a man gains nothing by wickedness. He sought money from Paul by iniquity, and failed; he sought by injustice to obtain the favor of the Jews, and failed in that also. And the inference from the whole transaction is, that "honesty is the best policy," and that men in any office should pursue a course of firm, constant, and undeviating integrity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. after two years&#8212;What a trial to this burning missionary of Christ, to suffer such a tedious period of inaction!

The famous Cato was of the family of the Porcii; his name was M. Porcius Cato, and came from Tusculum, a place about twelve miles from Rome, where there is a mountain which still retains the name of Porcius; we read also of Porcius Licinius, a Latin poet, whose fragments are still extant; whether this man was of the same family is not certain, it is very likely he might: his surname Festus signifies joyful and cheerful, as one keeping a feast; this was a name common with the Romans, as Rufus Festus, Pompeius Festus, and others: <p>and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound; he had done many injuries to their persons and properties, he had greatly abused them, and incensed them against him; and now he was sent for to Rome, to answer for his maladministration; wherefore, to gratify the Jews, and to oblige them, in hopes that they would not follow him with charges and accusations, at least would mitigate them, and not bear hard upon him, he leaves Paul bound at Caesarea, when it was in his power to have loosed him, and who he knew was an innocent person: but this piece of policy did him no service, for the persons he had wronged, the chief of the Jews at Caesarea, went to Rome, and accused him to Caesar; and he was sent by his successor thither, to appear before Nero, and answer to the charges exhibited against him; and had it not been for his brother Pallas, who was in great authority at court, he had been severely punished (g). <p>(f) De Bello Jud. l. 2. c. 14. sect. 1. &amp; Antiqu. l. 20. c. 7. sect. 9.

Weizsäcker throws doubt upon the historical character of this imprisonment, and thinks that the episode is merely introduced by the writer of Acts, who in his ignorance of the name of the procurator doubles the incident before Felix and Festus; but Wendt declines to value so lightly the definite notices and accounts in Acts, and adds that the delay of the trial under a procurator devoid of a sense of duty was no improbable event. The recall of Felix has been assigned to very varying dates, Lightfoot naming 60, Wendt (1899) 61, Schürer, at the earliest 58, at the latest 61, probably 60, Ramsay 59, whilst McGiffert, following the Chronology recently advocated by O. Holtzmann (with a few earlier writers), places it as early as 55 (Harnack 55–56, following Eusebius, whilst Blass has also defended the Eusebian date). Both McGiffert and Holtzmann fix upon 55 because before the end of this year Pallas, the brother of Felix, was in disgrace; and yet, according to Josephus, Felix escaped the accusations brought against him by shielding himself behind his brother Pallas, whom Nero was then holding in special honour, Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xx., 8, 9, Tac., <span class="ital">Ann.</span>, xiii., 14. “Either Josephus is in error,” says O. Holtzmann, <span class="ital">Neutest. Zeitgeschichte</span>, p. 128, “or Festus went to Palestine in 55”. But there is good reason for thinking that Josephus was in error in stating that Felix escaped by his brother’s influence, then at its height, Jos., <span class="ital">u. s.</span> It is no doubt true that the influence of Pallas may have been very substantial long after his fall from court favour; but if the intervention of Pallas was subsequent to his fall, what becomes of the synchronism between his disgrace and the recall of Felix? But further, Pallas, according to the statement of Tacitus, <span class="ital">Ann.</span>, xiii., 14, was disgraced before the fourteenth birthday of Britannicus, in Feb. 55, but, if so, how could Felix have reached Rome at such an early period of that year? Nero came to the throne on 13th Oct., 54, and we have to suppose that the order for recall was sent and the return journey of Felix to the capital accomplished in spite of the winter season which made a sea voyage impossible (Ramsay, Zahn, Bacon); “one can therefore no longer base the chronology of an Apostle’s life upon the dismissal of a court favourite”. But are there no chronological data available? Albinus, the successor of Festus, was already procurator in 62. How long he had been in office we cannot say, but he was certainly procurator in the summer of that year (Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. i., vol. ii., p. 188, E.T.; <span class="ital">Biblical World</span>, p. 357, 1897). From Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xx., 9, 1, we learn that there was an interval of some few months full of disturbance and anarchy between the death of Festus and the arrival of Albinus in Jerusalem, so that we seem justified in inferring that Festus died probably in the winter of 61–62; and whilst the events of his procuratorship can scarcely have extended over five years (as would be demanded by the earlier chronology)—for in this case Josephus would surely have given us more information about them—it seems equally difficult to suppose that the events which Josephus does record could have been crowded into less than a year, or portions of two (Schürer). The entrance of Festus upon his office might thus be carried back to 59–60, and St. Paul’s departure for Rome would fall probably in 60. But a further contribution to the subject has been made by Mr. Turner, “Chronology of the N.T.,” Hastings’ B.D., pp. 418, 419, and he argues for the exclusion of a date as late as 60 for the accession of Festus, and for placing the recall of Felix in 57–59, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, between the earlier and later dates mentioned above; or, more definitely still, in 58, <span class="ital">cf.</span> p. 420. With this date Dr. Gilbert agrees, <span class="ital">Student’s Life of Paul</span>, p. 252, 1899. See further Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, ii., 634; Wendt (1899), p. 56; <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, March, 1897, Feb., 1898; “Festus” (A.

The latter, however, contrasts him favourably with his successor Albinus: “et Albinum cum ei dissimillimum fuisse tradit, scelestum hominem, simul illum laudat” (Blass). So far as our information goes, Festus also contrasts favourably with his predecessor; he acted with promptness to rid the country of robbers and <span class="ital">sicarii</span>, and amongst them of one impostor whose promises were specially seductive, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xx., 8, 9, 10, and <span class="ital">B.J.</span>, ii., 14, 1. But although, as Schürer says, he was disposed to act righteously, he found himself unable to undo the mischief wrought by his predecessor, and after a short administration death prevented him from coping further with the evils which infested the province. For his attitude towards St. Paul as his prisoner see notes below. Two other events marked his procuratorship: (1) the quarrel between the priests and Agrippa, because the latter built on to his palace so as to overlook the Temple, and the priests retaliated by building so as to shut off his view. Festus sided with Agrippa, but allowed the priests to appeal to Rome. (2) The decision of the emperor in favour of the Syrian against the Jewish inhabitants of Cæsarea, which caused a bitterness provoking in A.D. 66 the disturbances in which Josephus marked the beginnings of the great War, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xx., 8, 9.—<span class="greekheb">θέλων τε χάριτας καταθέσθαι τοῖς Ἰ</span>.: “desiring to gain favour with the Jews,” R.V., literally to lay down or deposit a favour with the Jews as a deposit for which a due return might be expected, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-23.htm" title="What have we done, that Alexander hath prevented us in making amity with the Jews to strengthen himself?">1Ma 10:23</a> R.; Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xi., 6, 5, so too in classical Greek, Thuc., i., 33, 128; Herod., vi., 41, etc. The policy of Felix was to gain popularity with the Jews in view of the accusations which followed him on his return to Rome, Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xx., 8, 9. That the pursuit of such a policy was not alien to the character of Roman officials see Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xx., 9, 5, where we learn that Albinus, desiring to gain the gratitude of the Jews, took money of all those in prison for some trifling fault, by which means the prisons indeed were emptied, but the country was full of robbers. In <span class="ital">B.J.</span>, ii., 14, 1, we learn that the same system was pursued by Albinus, the successor of Festus, until no one was left in the prisons but those who gave him nothing. According to [387] text Felix leaves Paul in prison to please his wife, but, as Blass points out, both reasons may be true.—<span class="greekheb">χάριτα</span> (W.H[388], R.V.) only (in N.T.) in Jude, <a href="/acts/24-4.htm" title="Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious to you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words.">Acts 24:4</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/25-9.htm" title="But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?">Acts 25:9</a> A; found in classics, though rarer than <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span>, Winer-Schmiedel, p. 88; in LXX, <a href="/zechariah/6-14.htm" title="And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.">Zechariah 6:14</a>—<span class="greekheb">δεδεμ</span>.: this does not at all imply that Paul had been quite free, and was now rebound, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/24-23.htm" title="And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come to him.">Acts 24:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἄνεσις</span> did not mean perfect freedom, and the <span class="ital">custodia militaris</span> might still continue. Nösgen thinks that the word in its position at the end of the verse indicates a severer form of custody, but this is by no means necessary, although as the last word of the episode, and as the result of all the intercourse with Felix, it has a dramatic force and pathos. Zeller, <span class="ital">Acts</span>, ii., p. 83, E.T., although he thinks it remarkable that Felix and Festus are represented as acting from the same motive, as Pilate for a similar reason had consented to the execution of Jesus, is constrained to admit that conduct such as that of the two procurators is too natural for its repetition to be surprising; unscrupulous officials are always ready by complaisance at the expense of others to appease those to whom they have given just cause for complaint.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[387] R(omana), in Blass, a first rough copy of St. Luke.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[388] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">But after two years</span>] More literally the <span class="ital">Rev.

Josephus (<span class="ital">B.J</span>. ii. 14. 1) gives him a far better character than his predecessor, but he had the same kind of difficulties to deal with in the outbreaks of the populace and the bands of assassins with which the country was infested. (Jos. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. xx. 8. 10) The <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> “Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus” comes nearer to the literal rendering “Felix received Porcius Festus as a successor,” but does not make the meaning clearer, and to put “Felix” as the subject in this sentence and in that which immediately follows gives an awkward sound to the English, which was neatly avoided in A.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure</span>] The literal sense is “to store up for himself favour with the Jews,” therefore the <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> gives the proper rendering, “and desiring to gain favour with the Jews.” Of course it may be said that if he shewed favour to them he would gain favour with them. But what he particularly desired at this time was to blunt the anger which the Jews (especially those of Cæsarea) felt against him, that they might be less bitter in their charges against him on his recall. And so he used Paul as his “Mammon of unrighteousness” and left him detained that he might make himself friends thereby.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">left Paul bound</span>] [<span class="ital">R. V.</span> in bonds.] This seems to indicate that before his departure Felix withdrew the indulgence which had been previously granted to Paul, and put him in bonds, so as to give to his successor the impression, which the Jews desired, that he was deserving of punishment. It would be very interesting to know what St Paul did during the two years that he was kept at Cæsarea. Various conjectures have been ventured on, but none with any ground of certainty. Some, accepting St Paul as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, point to this period as the time of its composition. Others assign to this imprisonment those letters of the Apostle which speak so much of his bonds, viz. to the Ephesians, the Philippians, the Colossians and Philemon, but the evidence in favour of Rome as the place whence they were written seems far to outweigh all that can be said on behalf of Cæsarea. Our only reflection on such a gap as this in the history of St Paul’s work must be that the Acts was not intended to be a narrative of any man’s labours, but how God employed now this servant, now that, for the establishment of the Kingdom of Christ. The remembrance of this will prevent us seeking from the book what it was not meant to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/24-27.htm" title="But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.">Acts 24:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διετίας</span>, <span class="ital">after two years</span>) during which the imprisonment continued.

Jud.,' 2. 14:1). Nothing is known of him from Tacitus or other Latin historians, and he appears from Josephus's account to have held the government for a very short time, probably less than two years, when he died ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 9:1). But the impression derived from Josephus is the same as that conveyed by St. Luke, that he was a just and upright ruler, in marked contrast with Felix his predecessor, and his successors Albinus and Gessius Florus. <span class="cmt_word">Desiring to gain favor</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to lay up in store good will</span>, or favor, or <span class="accented">a boon</span>, to be requited at some future period. A frequent phrase in the best classical authors. Felix had good reason thus to try and put the Jews under obligation to him at the close of his government. For the danger was great to the retiring governor of complaints being sent to the emperor of oppression and plunder, which were often listened to and punished. Josephus relates, in point of fact, that the chief Jews in Caesarea sent an embassy to Rome to lodge a charge against Felix before Nero; and that he only escaped punishment by the influence of his brother Pallas ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9). The scene in this chapter is a very striking one, depicted with admirable simplicity and force. The bloated slave sitting on the seat of judgment and power, representing all the worst vices of Roman degeneracy. The beads of the sinking Jewish commonwealth, blinded by bigotry and nearly mad with hatred, forgetting for the moment their abhorrence of their Roman masters, in their yet deeper detestation of the Apostle Paul. The hired advocate with his fulsome flattery, his rounded periods, and his false charges. And then the great apostle, the noble confessor, the finished Christian gentleman, the pure-minded, upright, and fearless man, pleading his own cause with consummate force and dignity, and overawing his heathen judge by the majesty of his character. It is a graphic description of s very noble scene. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Porcius Festus came into Felix's room (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3a6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3be; &#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3a6;&#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., better, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus.
