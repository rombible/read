Sometimes God opens a door of opportunity to his ministers in very unlikely places. We should study to do good to those we come into company with by travelling. We should not be so shy of all strangers as some affect to be. As to those of whom we know nothing else, we know this, that they have souls. It is wisdom for men of business to redeem time for holy duties; to fill up every minute with something which will turn to a good account. In reading the word of God, we should often pause, to inquire of whom and of what the sacred writers spake; but especially our thoughts should be employed about the Redeemer. The Ethiopian was convinced by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, of the exact fulfilment of the Scripture, was made to understand the nature of the Messiah's kingdom and salvation, and desired to be numbered among the disciples of Christ. Those who seek the truth, and employ their time in searching the Scriptures, will be sure to reap advantages. The avowal of the Ethiopian must be understood as expressing simple reliance on Christ for salvation, and unreserved devotion to Him. Let us not be satisfied till we get faith, as the Ethiopian did, by diligent study of the Holy Scriptures, and the teaching of the Spirit of God; let us not be satisfied till we get it fixed as a principle in our hearts. As soon as he was baptized, the Spirit of God took Philip from him, so that he saw him no more; but this tended to confirm his faith. When the inquirer after salvation becomes acquainted with Jesus and his gospel, he will go on his way rejoicing, and will fill up his station in society, and discharge his duties, from other motives, and in another manner than heretofore. Though baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, with water, it is not enough without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Lord, grant this to every one of us; then shall we go on our way rejoicing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Opened his mouth - See <a href="/matthew/5-2.htm">Matthew 5:2</a>.<p>At the same scripture - Taking this as a "text" to be illustrated.<p>Preached unto him Jesus - Showed him that Jesus of Nazareth exactly corresponded to the description of the prophet, and that therefore he referred to the Messiah, and that the Messiah was Jesus of Nazareth.

With freedom and boldness, and spoke clearly and distinctly, and expounded the passage to him. This is a phrase frequently used in Jewish writings, especially in the book of Zohar (e), when they give an account of this or the other Rabbi interpreting any place of Scripture; as for instance, R. Eleazar  "opened", and said, "my sabbaths you shall keep", &amp;c. Again, R. Aba  "opened", and said, "and Manoah said unto his wife", &amp;c. Once more, "R. Simeon opened", and said, "the heavens declare the glory of God", &amp;c. and <p>began at the same Scripture: "the fifty third of Isaiah": and preached unto him Jesus of Nazareth; how that he was the true Messiah, and the person there designed, and that very rightly; for the Jews themselves, the ancient ones, have interpreted several passages in that chapter of the Messiah, as has been before observed; he showed him how that he was born of a virgin, made under the law, and yielded perfect obedience to it in his life; and that he suffered and died for the sins of his people, and made satisfaction for them, and brought in an everlasting righteousness to justify them before God, and had obtained eternal redemption for them; that he was risen from the dead, was ascended into heaven, and now sat at the right hand of God, and ever lived to make intercession for transgressors; and would come a second time to judge both quick and dead; and in the mean while had left rules for the gathering, and forming, and governing his churches; and had appointed persons to preach his Gospel, and to administer the ordinances of baptism, and the supper of the Lord, which were to continue till his second coming. <p>(e) In Gen. fol. 5. 3. 4. &amp; 6. 1. 3. &amp; 7. 1. 2. 3. &amp; 8. 1. 2. 3. &amp; passim. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/8-35.htm" title="Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.">Acts 8:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνοίξας τὸ στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>: the phrase is used to introduce some weighty and important utterance, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a>, <a href="/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14</a>, and <a href="/luke/1-64.htm" title="And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.">Luke 1:64</a>, so too <a href="/matthew/5-2.htm" title="And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,">Matthew 5:2</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:11</a>, also frequent in LXX; “aperire os in Scriptura est ordiri longum sermonem de re gravi et seria.
