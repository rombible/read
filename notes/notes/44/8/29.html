<span class="ital">said to Philip, Go near </span>— Now Philip shall know the reason of his being sent into a desert; <span class="ital">join thyself to this chariot </span>— Enter into conversation with the person who sits in it, without fear of offending him, or exposing thyself to any inconvenience. <span class="ital">And Philip ran to him </span>— Ran up to the chariot; <span class="ital">and heard him read </span>— For he read aloud, both that his own mind might be more deeply impressed with what he read, and that his servants, who were near, might receive some benefit by it. And Philip, being well acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, soon perceived that the book in which he read was that of the Prophet Isaiah, and that the passage he was reading would give him a very proper opportunity of entering into discourse with him concerning Christ, and delivering to him that evangelical message with which he was charged. He therefore took occasion to begin the conversation from this circumstance, saying to the eunuch, <span class="ital">Understandest thou what thou readest? </span>— This question Philip puts to him, not by way of reproach, but with a design to offer him his service, and lead him into the true knowledge of the important prophecy which now engaged his attention. Observe, what we read and hear of the word of God, it highly concerns us to understand; especially what we read and hear concerning Christ; and therefore we should often ask ourselves whether we understand it or not. Philip did not begin about the weather, news, or the like. In speaking for God, we may frequently come to the point at once without circumlocution. <span class="ital">And he said, How can I — </span>The eunuch was so far from being offended at the freedom Philip took, that he mildly and respectfully said in reply, <span class="ital">How should I </span>understand such obscure oracles as these, <span class="ital">except some man should guide me </span>— Unless some person, better acquainted with the contents of them than I am, should throw that light upon them which I, who am so much a stranger to the Jewish affairs, must necessarily be destitute of. <span class="ital">And he desired Philip to come up and sit with him </span>— Inferring from the question he put, that he was better acquainted with these things than himself. Here we see a remarkable instance of the providence and grace of God. This great man had been at Jerusalem, where the apostles were preaching the Christian faith, and multitudes professing it, and yet there he had taken no notice of it, and made no inquiries after it; nay, it seems had slighted it, and turned his back upon it. Yet the grace of God pursues him, overtakes him in the desert, and there converts him. Thus God is often found of those that sought him not!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:26-40 Philip was directed to go to a desert. Sometimes God opens a door of opportunity to his ministers in very unlikely places. We should study to do good to those we come into company with by travelling. We should not be so shy of all strangers as some affect to be. As to those of whom we know nothing else, we know this, that they have souls. It is wisdom for men of business to redeem time for holy duties; to fill up every minute with something which will turn to a good account. In reading the word of God, we should often pause, to inquire of whom and of what the sacred writers spake; but especially our thoughts should be employed about the Redeemer. The Ethiopian was convinced by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, of the exact fulfilment of the Scripture, was made to understand the nature of the Messiah's kingdom and salvation, and desired to be numbered among the disciples of Christ. Those who seek the truth, and employ their time in searching the Scriptures, will be sure to reap advantages. The avowal of the Ethiopian must be understood as expressing simple reliance on Christ for salvation, and unreserved devotion to Him. Let us not be satisfied till we get faith, as the Ethiopian did, by diligent study of the Holy Scriptures, and the teaching of the Spirit of God; let us not be satisfied till we get it fixed as a principle in our hearts. As soon as he was baptized, the Spirit of God took Philip from him, so that he saw him no more; but this tended to confirm his faith. When the inquirer after salvation becomes acquainted with Jesus and his gospel, he will go on his way rejoicing, and will fill up his station in society, and discharge his duties, from other motives, and in another manner than heretofore. Though baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, with water, it is not enough without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Lord, grant this to every one of us; then shall we go on our way rejoicing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Spirit - See the notes on <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>.
