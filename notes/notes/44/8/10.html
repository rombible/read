All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness.

The Samaritans believed that Simon was the power emanating from God, and appearing and working among them as a human person, which, as the highest of the divine powers, was designated by them with a specific appellation <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐξοχήν</span> as the <span class="greekheb">μεγάλη</span>. Probably the Oriental-Alexandrine idea of the world-creating manifestation of the hidden God (the <span class="ital">Logos</span>, which Philo also calls <span class="greekheb">μητρόπολις πασῶν τῶν δυνάμεων τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>) had become at that time current among them, and they saw in Simon this effluence of the Godhead rendered human by incarnation,—a belief which Simon certainly had been cunning enough himself to excite and to promote, and which makes it more than probable that the magician, to whom the neighbouring Christianity could not be unknown, designed in the part which he played to present a phenomenon similar to Christ; comp. Ewald. The belief of the Samaritans in Simon was thus, as regards its tenor, an analogue of the <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο</span>, and hence served to prepare for the true and definite faith in the Messiah, afterwards preached to them by Philip: the former became the bridge to the latter. Erroneously Philastr. <span class="ital">Haer.</span> 29, and recently Olshausen, de Wette, and others put the words <span class="greekheb">ἡ δύναμις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. into the mouth of Simon himself, so that they are held only to be an echo of what the sorcerer had boastingly said of himself.[221] This is contrary to the text, which expressly distinguishes the opinion of the infatuated people here from the assertion of the magician himself (<a href="/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a>). He had characterized himself <span class="ital">indefinitely</span>; they judged <span class="ital">definitely</span> and <span class="ital">confessed</span> (<span class="greekheb">λέγοντες</span>) the highest that could be said of him; and in doing so, accorded with the intention of the sorcerer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[221] According to Jerome on <span class="ital">Matthew 24</span>, he asserted of himself: “Ego sum sermo Dei, ego sum speciosus, ego paracletus, ego omnipotens, ego omnia Dei.” Certainly an invention of the later Simonians, who transferred specifically Christian elements of faith to Simon. But this and similar things which were put into the mouth of Simon (that he was <span class="greekheb">ἀνωτάτη τις δύναμις καὶ αὐτοῦ τοῦ τὸν κόσμον κτίσαντος Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">Clem. Hom.</span> ii. 22, 25; that he was the same who had appeared among the Jews as the Son, but had come among the Samaritans as the Father, and among other nations as the Holy Spirit, Iren. i. 23), and were wonderfully dilated on by opponents, point back to a <span class="ital">relation of incarnation</span> analogous to the incarnation of the <span class="ital">Logos</span>, under which the adherents of Simon conceived him. De Wette incorrectly denies this, referring the expression: “the great power of God,” to the notion of an <span class="ital">angel</span>. This is too weak; all the ancient accounts concerning Simon, as well as concerning his alleged companion Helena, the all-bearing mother of angels and powers, betoken a <span class="ital">Messianic</span> part which he played; to which also the name <span class="greekheb">ὁ Ἑστώς</span>, by which he designated himself according to the Clementines, points. This name (hardly correctly explained by Ritschl, <span class="ital">altkath. Kirche</span>, p. 228 f., from <span class="greekheb">ἀναστήσει</span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm" title="I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brothers, like to you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>) denotes the <span class="ital">imperishable</span> and <span class="ital">unchangeable</span>. See, besides, concerning Simon and his doctrine according to the Clementines, Uhlhorn, <span class="ital">die Homil. u. Recognit. des Clemens Rom</span>. p. 281 ff.; Zeller, p. 159 ff.; and concerning the entire diversified development of the old legends concerning him, Müller in Herzog’s <span class="ital">Encykl.</span> XIV. p. 391 ff.; concerning his doctrine of the Aeons and Syzygies, <span class="ital">Philosoph. Orig.</span> vi. 7 ff. According to Baur and Zeller, the magician <span class="ital">never existed at all</span>; and the <span class="ital">legend</span> concerning him, which arose from Christian polemics directed against the Samaritan worship of the snn-god, the Oriental Hercules (Baal-Melkart), is nothing else than a hostile <span class="ital">travestie of the Apostle Paul</span> and his antinomian labours. Comp. also Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">d. clement. Recognit</span>. p. 319 f.; Volckmar in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb</span>. 1856, p. 279 ff. The Book of Acts has, in their view, admitted this legend about Simon, but has cut off the reference to Paul. Thus the state of the case is exactly reversed. The history of Simon Magus in our passage was amplified in the Clementines in an anti-Pauline interest. The Book of Acts has not cut off the hostile reference to Paul; but the Clementines have added it, and accordingly have dressed out the history with a view to combat Paulinism and Gnosticism, indeed have here and there caricatured Paul himself as Simon. We set to work unhistorically, if we place the simple narratives of the N. T. on a parallel with later historical excrescences and disfigurements, and by means of the latter attack the former as likewise fabulous representations. Our narrative contains the historical germ, from which the later legends concerning Simon Magus have luxuriantly developed themselves; the Samaritan worship of the sun and moon has nothing whatever to do with the history of Simon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ δύναμις</span> το͂<span class="greekheb">υ Θεοῦ ἡ μεγάλη</span>: in R.V. the power of God which is called (<span class="greekheb">καλουμένη</span>) Great, see above, critical notes. T.R. may have omitted the word because it appeared unsuitable to the context; but it could not have been used in a depreciatory sense by the Samaritans, as if to intimate that the person claimed was the so-called “Great,” since they also gave heed to Simon. On the other hand it has been argued that the title “Great” is meaningless in this relation, for every divine power might be described by the same epithet (so Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and Blass: “mirum maxime <span class="greekheb">ἡ καλ</span>. quasi <span class="greekheb">δύναμις Θ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μικρά</span> quoque esse possit”. This difficulty leads Blass in his notes to introduce the solution proposed by Klostermann, <span class="ital">Problem im Aposteltexte</span>, pp. 15–20 (1883), and approved by Wendt, Zöckler, Spitta, and recently by Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung in das N. T.</span>, ii. 420; see also Salmon’s remarks in <span class="ital">Hermathena</span>, xxi., p. 232), <span class="ital">vix.</span>, that <span class="greekheb">μεγάλη</span> is not a translation of the attribute “great” <span class="greekheb">רב</span>, but rather a transcription of the Samaritan word <span class="greekheb">מגלי</span> or <span class="greekheb">מגלא</span> meaning <span class="ital">qui revelat</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Hebrew <span class="greekheb">גָּלָה</span>, Chaldean <span class="greekheb">גְּלָא גְּלַה</span>, to reveal). The explanation would then be that in contrast to the hidden essence of the Godhead, Simon was known as its revealing power. Nestle however (see Knabenbauer <span class="ital">in loco</span>) objects on the ground that <span class="greekheb">καλουμένη</span> is not read at all in many MSS. But apart from Klostermann’s explanation the revised text might fairly mean that amongst the “powers” of God (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the N.T. use of the word <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span> in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1 Peter 3:22</a>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="ital">Book of Enoch</span> lxi. 10) Simon was emphatically the one which is called great, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the one prominently great or divine. The same title was assigned to him in later accounts, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Irenæus, i., 23 (Clem. <span class="ital">Hom.</span>, ii., 22; Clem. <span class="ital">Recog.</span>, i., 72; ii, 7; Tertullian, <span class="ital">De Præscr.</span>, xlvi.; Origen, <span class="ital">c. Celsum</span>, v.). But whatever the claims made by Simon himself, or attributed to him by his followers, we need not read them into the words before us. The expression might mean nothing more than that Simon called himself a great (or revealing) angel of God, since by the Samaritans the angels were regarded as <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span>, powers of God (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Edersheim, <span class="ital">Jesus the Messiah</span>, i., 402, note 4, and De Wette, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 122, fourth edition). Such an explanation is far more probable than the attribution to the Samaritans of later Gnostic and philosophical beliefs, while it is a complete answer to Overbeck, who argues that as the patristic literature about Simon presupposes the emanation theories of the Gnostics so the expression in the verse before us must be explained in the same way, and that thus we have a direct proof that the narrative is influenced by the Simon legend. We may however readily admit that Simon’s teaching may have been a starting-point for the later Gnostic developments, and so far from <a href="/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a> demanding a Gnostic system as a background, we may rather see in it a glimpse of the <span class="ital">genesis</span> of the beliefs which afterwards figure so prominently in the Gnostic schools (Nösgen, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte, in loco</span>, and p. 186, and see McGiffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 99, and “Gnosticism,” <span class="ital">Dict. of Christ. Biog.</span>, ii., 680). On the close connection between the Samaritans and Egypt and the widespread study of sorcery amongst the Egyptian Samaritans see Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, pp. 18, 19. In Hadrian’s letter to Servianus we find the Samaritans in Egypt described, like the Jews and Christians there, as all astrologers, sooth sayers and quacks (Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. ii., p. 230 E.T.): no doubt an exaggeration, as Deissmann says, but still a proof that amongst these Egyptian Samaritans magic and its kindred arts were widely known. In a note on p. 19 Deissmann gives an interesting parallel to <a href="/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπικαλοῦμαί σε τὴν μεγίστην δύναμιν τὴν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἄλλοι</span>· <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐν τῇ ἄρκτῳ</span>) <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ Κυρίου Θεοῦ τεταγμένην</span> (<span class="ital">Pap.

Origen says of Simon that his disciples, the Simoniaus, called him "The Power of God." ('Contra Cels.,' lib. 5:62, where see Delarue's note).
