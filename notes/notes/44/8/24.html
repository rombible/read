(1) His conscience reads “between the lines” of St. Peter’s address what was not actually found there. That “if perhaps” is to him as the knell of doom. (2) He prays not for deliverance from “the bond of iniquity,” but only from the vague terror of a future penalty. (3) He turns, not, as Peter had bidden him, to the Lord who was ready to forgive, but to a human mediator. Peter must pray for him who has not faith to pray for himself.<p>At this point Simon disappears from the history of the Acts, and this seems accordingly the right place for stating briefly the later traditions as to his history. In those traditions he occupies a far more prominent position than in St. Luke’s narrative, and becomes, as it has been said, the “hero of the romance of heresy,” as given in the <span class= "ital">Homilies</span> and <span class= "ital">Recognitions</span> of the Pseudo-Clement. Born at Gittom, in Samaria (Justin, <span class= "ital">Apol.</span> i. 26), he received his education at Alexandria, and picked up the language of a mystic Gnosticism from Dositheus (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> ii. c. 22; <span class= "ital">Constt. Apost.</span> vi. 8). He had for a short time been a disciple of the Baptist (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> c. 23). He murdered a boy that the soul of his victim might become his familiar spirit, and give him insight into the future (<span class= "ital">Hom. ii.</span> c. 26; <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> ii. 9). He carried about with him a woman of great beauty, of the name of Luna or Helena, whom he represented as a kind of incarnation of the Wisdom or Thought of God (Justin, <span class= "ital">Apol. i.</span> 6; <span class= "ital">Hom.</span> ii. c. 25; Euseb. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 13). He identified himself with the promised Paraclete and the Christ, and took the name of “<span class= "ital">He who stands</span>,” as indicating divine power (<span class= "ital">Recogn. ii.</span> 7). He boasted that he could turn himself and others into the form of brute beasts; that he could cause statues to speak (<span class= "ital">Hom. iv.</span> c. 4; <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> ii. 9, iii. 6). His life was one of ostentatious luxury. He was accompanied by the two sons of the Syro-Phœnician woman of <a href="/mark/7-26.htm" title="The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she sought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.">Mark 7:26</a> (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> i. 19). After the episode related <span class= "ital">in</span> the Acts, he went down to Cæsarea, and Peter was then sent thither by James, the Bishop of Jerusalem, to confront and hold a disputation with him on various points of doctrine. From Cæsarea he made his way to Tyre and Tripolis, and thence to Rome, and was there worshipped by his followers, so that an altar was seen there by Justin with an inscription, “SIMONI DEO SANCTO” (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> i. 56). Peter followed him, and in the reign of Claudius the two met, once more face to face, in the imperial city. According to one legend, he offered to prove his divinity by flying in the air. trusting that the demons whom he employed would support him; but, through the power of the prayers of Peter, he fell down, and had his bones broken, and then committed suicide (<span class= "ital">Constt. Apost.</span> ii. 14; 6:9). Another represents him as buried alive at his own request, in order that he might show his power by rising on the third day from the dead, and so meeting his death (Irenæus, <span class= "ital">Adv. Hær</span>. vi. 20).<p>In the midst of all this chaos of fantastic fables, we have, perhaps, one grain of fact in Justin’s assertion that he had seen the altar above referred to. An altar was discovered at Rome in 1574, on the island in the Tiber, with the inscription “SEMONI SANCO DEO FIDIO.” Archæologists, however, agree in thinking that this was dedicated to the Sabine Hercules, who was known as SEMO SANCUS, and it has been thought by many writers that Justin may have seen this or some like altar, and, in his ignorance of Italian mythology, have imagined that it was consecrated to the Sorcerer of Samaria. His statement is repeated by Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 13) and Irenæus (i. 20). Of the three names in the inscription, Semo (probably connected with <span class= "ital">Semen</span> as the God of Harvest, or as <span class= "ital">Semihomo</span>) appears by itself in the Hymn of the Fratres Arvales, and in connection with Sancus and Fidius (probably connected with <span class= "ital">Fides, </span>and so employed in the formula of asseveration, <span class= "ital">medius fidius</span>) in Ovid, <span class= "ital">Fast.</span> vi. 213; Livy, viii. 20; 32:1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then answered Simon </span>— Alarmed by the solemn admonition given him; <span class="ital">and said </span>— To the apostles; <span class="ital">Pray ye to the Lord for me </span>— If you indeed conceive my case to be so bad, extend your charity so far as to make your supplications to the Lord on my account; <span class="ital">that none of these things, which ye have spoken, come upon me </span>— He probably inferred, from what Peter had said, that some token of God’s wrath would soon fall upon him, which he thus dreaded and deprecated. But there is reason to fear that this pretence of conviction and humiliation was used chiefly to prevent Peter and John from disgracing him among the body of Christians: for it is reasonable to suppose this conversation passed in private between them: and, perhaps, Simon might have some hope, that, if the secret were kept, he might reduce the people, when Peter was gone, to their former subjection to him, notwithstanding their conversion to Christianity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-25 The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of these coverts, in the extraordinary powers conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost. We may take encouragement from this example, in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to all for whose spiritual welfare we are concerned; for that includes all blessings. No man can give the Holy Spirit by the laying on of his hands; but we should use our best endeavours to instruct those for whom we pray. Simon Magus was ambitious to have the honour of an apostle, but cared not at all to have the spirit and disposition of a Christian. He was more desirous to gain honour to himself, than to do good to others. Peter shows him his crime. He esteemed the wealth of this world, as if it would answer for things relating to the other life, and would purchase the pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. This was such a condemning error as could by no means consist with a state of grace. Our hearts are what they are in the sight of God, who cannot be deceived. And if they are not right in his sight, our religion is vain, and will stand us in no stead. A proud and covetous heart cannot be right with God. It is possible for a man to continue under the power of sin, yet to put on a form of godliness. When tempted with money to do evil, see what a perishing thing money is, and scorn it. Think not that Christianity is a trade to live by in this world. There is much wickedness in the thought of the heart, its false notions, and corrupt affections, and wicked projects, which must be repented of, or we are undone. But it shall be forgiven, upon our repentance. The doubt here is of the sincerity of Simon's repentance, not of his pardon, if his repentance was sincere. Grant us, Lord, another sort of faith than that which made Simon wonder only, and did not sanctify his heart. May we abhor all thoughts of making religion serve the purposes of pride or ambition. And keep us from that subtle poison of spiritual pride, which seeks glory to itself even from humility. May we seek only the honour which cometh from God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pray ye ... - Here remark:<p>(1) That Simon was directed to pray for himself <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm">Acts 8:22</a>, but he had no disposition to do it, but was willing to ask others to do it for him. Sinners will often ask others to pray for them, when they are too proud, or too much in love with sin, to pray for themselves.<p>(2) the main thing that Peter wished to impress on him was a sense of his sin. Simon did not regard this, but looked only to the punishment. He was terrified and alarmed; he sought to avoid future "punishment," but he had no alarm about his "sins." So it is often with sinners. So it was with Pharaoh <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-28.htm">Exodus 8:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm">Exodus 8:32</a>, and with Jeroboam <a href="/1_kings/13-6.htm">1 Kings 13:6</a>. Sinners often quiet their own consciences by asking ministers and Christian friends to pray for them, while "they" still purpose to persevere in iniquity. If people expect to be saved, they must pray "for themselves"; and pray not chiefly to be freed from "punishment," but from the "sin which deserves hell." This is all that we hear of Simon in the New Testament; and the probability is, that, like many other sinners, he did not pray for himself, but continued to live in the gall of bitterness, and died in the bond of iniquity. The testimony of antiquity is decided on that point. See the notes on <a href="/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Pray ye to the Lord for me&#8212;Peter had urged him to pray for himself: he asks those wonder-working men to do it for him; having no confidence in the prayer of faith, but thinking that those men possessed some peculiar interest with heaven.<p>that none of these things dome upon me&#8212;not that the thought of his wicked heart might be forgiven him, but only that the evils threatened might be averted from him. While this throws great light on Peter's view of his melancholy case, it shows that Christianity, as something divine, still retained its hold of him. (Tradition represents him as turning out a great heresiarch, mingling Oriental or Grecian philosophy with some elements of Christianity.)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Simon Magus was convinced that he was indeed such as the apostles had spoken him to be; and knowing them to be powerful with God, he desires this of them.

Whose conscience might be touched, and smote with what Peter had said; and he might be terrified with the wrath of God, and filled with fear of his judgment coming upon him for his wickedness, and might now stand trembling before the apostles: and if this was not his case, he was a most hardened and audacious wretch; and his following words must be understood in a different sense, from what they might seem to have, when they came out of his mouth: <p>pray ye to the Lord for me; the Arabic version reads, "pray ye two"; the words are addressed both to Peter and John; for though Peter only spake to him, yet John joined with him, and assented to what he said, and approved of it; and which he might signify either by word or gesture; wherefore Simon desires both of them, that they would pray to the Lord for him; but whether he was serious, and in good earnest in this, is a question; since there is no reason to believe he truly repented, from the accounts given of him by ancient writers; who always represent him as an opposer of the apostles and their doctrine, as the father of all heresies, as a blasphemous wretch; who gave out that he was the Father in Samaria, the Son in Judea, and the Holy Ghost in other places; and as a very lewd and wicked man, who carried about with him a whore, whose name was Helena; whom he called the mother of the universe, and gave out the angels were made by her, and the world by them; with many other errors, blasphemies, and impieties: so that it should rather seem, that though Peter was serious in his advice to Simon, yet he was not so in his request to him; but in a sarcastic sneering way, desired his prayers for him; suggesting, that he was not in any pain about what he had said: and if he was in earnest, he did not take Peter's advice to pray for himself; nor did he declare any repentance for his sin; and his desire that the apostles would pray for him, might not be from any sense he had of the evil of his sin, but from a slavish fear of the evil, or mischief, that was like to come upon him for his sin, as appears by what follows: <p>that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me; as that his money should perish with him, and he with that; or that he should go into destruction; that everlasting destruction and ruin would be his portion; and that he should have no part nor lot in eternal life, unless he repented, and his sin was pardoned: and this confirms what has been before observed, that John assented to what Peter spoke, or said the same, or such like things to Simon as he did. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/acts/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/acts/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑμεῖς</span>] whose prayer must be <span class="ital">more effectual</span>.

Hence, also, his <span class="ital">conversion</span> (which even Calvin conjectures to have taken place; comp. Ebrard) does not ensue. It would, as a brilliant victory of the apostolic word, not have been omitted; and in fact the ecclesiastical traditions concerning the stedfastly continued conflict of Simon with the Jewish-apostolic gospel, in spite of all the strange and contradictory fables mixed up with it down to his overthrow by Peter at Rome, testify against the occurrence of that conversion at all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/acts/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δεήθητε</span>: the verse is often taken (as by Meyer and others) as a further proof of the hollowness of Simon’s belief, and his ignorance of the way of true repentance—he will not pray for himself, and he only asks for deliverance from fear of the penalty and not from hatred of the sin (so Bengel). But on the other hand Wendt, in criticising Meyer, objects to this further condemnation of Simon as not expressed in the text. So far as the petition for the Apostles’ prayers is concerned, it is of course possible that it may have been prompted by the belief that such prayers would be more efficacious than his own (so Blass, Wendt, see also conclusion of the story in ); he does not ask them to pray instead of himself but <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>, on his behalf.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπέλθῃ</span>: not used by the other Evangelists, but three times in St. Luke’s Gospel and four times in Acts, with <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> and accusative both in Gospel (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.">Luke 1:35</a>. <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/21-35.htm" title="For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.">Luke 21:35</a>) and Acts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">that none of these</span> [the] <span class="ital">things which ye have spoken come upon me</span>] Simon shews by the character of his petition that he is not moved by a true spirit of repentance. He utters no word of sorrow for the evil of his thought, but only petitions that he may suffer no punishment. Yet we can see that he had not taken the expression of St Peter in <span class="ital"><a href="/acts/8-20.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.">Acts 8:20</a></span> as a curse invoked upon him by the Apostle, but only as a declaration of the anger of God, and of the certainty of a penalty upon wilful continuance in such sin. His entreaty may be compared with that oft-repeated petition of Pharaoh to Moses (<a href="/exodus/8-8.htm" title="Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.">Exodus 8:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/8-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away: entreat for me.">Exodus 8:28</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-28.htm" title="Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.">Exodus 9:28</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-17.htm" title="Now therefore forgive, I pray you, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.">Exodus 10:17</a>) “Intreat the Lord for me,” extorted by fear and followed by no change of conduct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δεήθητε</span>, <span class="ital">pray ye</span>) Peter had said, <span class="ital">Pray</span> GOD.
