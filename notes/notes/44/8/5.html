As having been conspicuous in the work of “preaching the glad tidings of Christ,” he was afterwards known as Philip the Evangelist (<a href="/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>). It was natural enough that the identity of name should lead writers who were imperfectly informed to confuse the two, as Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus, seems to have done in the passage quoted by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> iii. 31). The “city of Samaria” is described in precisely the same terms as in <a href="/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>, where it is identified with Sychar, the Sichem of the Old Testament. (See Note on <a href="/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>.) “Samaria,” throughout the New Testament (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="/acts/9-31.htm" title="Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a>; <a href="/context/john/4-4.htm" title="And he must needs go through Samaria.">John 4:4-5</a>), is used for the province, and not for the city to which it had been attached in earlier times. This had been new-named <span class= "ital">Sebaste</span> (the Greek equivalent of Augusta) by Herod the Great in honour of the Emperor, and this had more or less superseded the old name (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> 8, § 5). Assuming the identity with Sychar, the narrative of John 4 suggests at once the reason that probably determined Philip’s choice. The seed had already been sown, and the fields were white for harvest (<a href="/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>). Possibly, as suggested above (Note on <a href="/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a>), there may have been some previous connection with the district. Some of that city had already accepted Jesus as the Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Preached Christ.</span>—The verb is not the same as in <a href="/acts/8-4.htm" title="Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.">Acts 8:4</a>, and is the word used for “preaching” or “proclaiming.” The tense implies continued action, extending, it may be, over weeks or months. We find in <a href="/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a> that the expectation of the Messiah was as strong among the Samaritans as among the Jews, and Philip’s work therefore was to proclaim that the long-expected One had come, and that the Resurrection was the crowning proof that He was the Christ the Son of God. The readiness with which the proclamation was accepted shows that in spite of the adverse influence which had come into play since our Lord had taught there, the work then done had not been in vain.<p><span class= "bld">Hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">the signs, </span>as being closer, here as elsewhere, to the force of the Greek. It is remarkable that they had believed in the first instance without any other sign than the person and the teaching of the Lord Jesus.

Nay, indeed, in some respects they were better prepared than the body of the Jewish nation, as we do not find that they had either such notions of the Messiah’s temporal reign as the Jews had, or had received the Sadducean principles, which were both very strong prejudices against the Christian doctrine. <span class="ital">And the people — </span>Who inhabited that city, notwithstanding their natural prejudices against the Jews; <span class="ital">with one accord — </span><span class="greekheb">Ομοθυμαδον</span>, <span class="ital">unanimously; gave heed unto those things which Philip spake </span>— Of the truth and importance of which, upon their attending to them, they were soon persuaded; <span class="ital">hearing </span>— The rational and convincing arguments which he used; <span class="ital">and seeing the miracles</span> — Which he performed, in confirmation of his doctrine. <span class="ital">For unclean spirits </span>— At Philip’s command, <span class="ital">came out of many </span>persons <span class="ital">that </span>had been <span class="ital">possessed </span>by <span class="ital">them, crying with a loud voice </span>— Which showed that they came out with great reluctance, and much against their wills, but were forced to acknowledge themselves overcome by a superior power. <span class="ital">And there was great joy in that city </span>— Both on account of those benevolent miracles which were performed by Philip in it, and of that excellent doctrine which he preached among them, containing such welcome tidings of pardon and eternal salvation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Philip - One of the seven deacons, <a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>. He is afterward called the "evangelist," <a href="/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>.<p>The city of Samaria - This does not mean a city whose "name" was Samaria, for no such city at that time existed. Samaria was a "region," <a href="/matthew/2-22.htm">Matthew 2:22</a>. The ancient city Samaria, the capital of that region, had been destroyed by Hyrcanus, so completely as to leave no vestige of it remaining; and he "took away," says Josephus, "the very marks that there had ever been such a city there" (Antiq., book 13, chapter 10, section 3). Herod the Great afterward built a city on this site, and called it "Sebaste"; that is, "Augusta," in honor of the Emperor Augustus (Josephus, Antiq., book 15, chapter 8, section 5). Perhaps this city is intended, as being the principal city of Samaria; or possibly "Sychar," another city where the gospel had been before preached by the Saviour himself, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a>.<p>And preached Christ - Preached that the Messiah had come, and made known his doctrines. The same truths had been before stated in Samaria by the Saviour himself <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a>; and this was doubtless one of the reasons why they so gladly now received the Word of God. The field had been prepared by the Lord Jesus. He had said that it was white for the harvest <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, and into that field Philip now entered, and was signally blessed. His coming was attended with a remarkable "revival of religion." The word translated "preach" here is not what is used in the previous verse. This denotes to "proclaim as a crier," and is commonly employed to denote the preaching of the gospel, so called, <a href="/mark/5-20.htm">Mark 5:20</a>; <a href="/mark/7-36.htm">Mark 7:36</a>; <a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>. It has been argued that because "Philip" is said thus to have preached to the Samaritans, that "therefore" all "deacons" have a right to preach, or that they are, under the New Testament economy, an "order" of ministers. But this is by no means clear. For:<p>(1) It is not evident, nor can it be shown, that the "other" deacons <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-15</a> ever preached. There is no record of their doing so; and the narrative would lead us to suppose that they did not.<p>(2) they were "appointed" for a very different purpose <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-5</a>; and it is fair to suppose that, as "deacons," they confined themselves to the design of their appointment.<p>(3) it is not said that "Philip" preached in virtue of his being a "deacon." From anything in "this" place, it would seem that he preached as the other Christians did - wherever he was.<p>(4) but "elsewhere" an express distinction is made between Philip and the others. A new appellation is given him, and he is expressly called the "evangelist," <a href="/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>. From this, it seems that he preached, not "because" he was a "deacon," but because he had received a special "appointment" to this business as an evangelist.<p>(5) this same office, or rank of Christian teachers, is expressly recognized elsewhere, <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>. All these considerations show that there is "not" in the sacred Scriptures an order of ministers appointed to preach "as deacons." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ac 8:5-25.
