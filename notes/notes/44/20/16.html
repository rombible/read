(2) It revived the memories and the power of the great day which had been the birthday of the Church’s life as a distinct society. (3) St. Paul was contemplating a journey from Syria to Rome after his visit, and that would hardly have been feasible had he waited for the Feast of the Tabernacles. It might have seemed at first as if there was little gained in point of time by sending for the elders to come to him instead of going to them. We must remember, however, that had he taken the journey he would have been exposed to the accidents of travel, perhaps to a fresh riot like that of Demetrius, and might have been detained beyond the day fixed for the departure of the ship. By remaining at Miletus it was in his power to embark at any moment.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:13-16 Paul hastened to Jerusalem, but tried to do good by the way, when going from place to place, as every good man should do.

The words have sometimes been interpreted as if St. Paul had control over a ship which he had hired himself, and could stop where he pleased, so Alford, Hackett, Rendall. But if so, there seems no definite reason for his going to Miletus at all, as it would have been shorter for him to have stopped at Ephesus, or to have made his farewell address there. According to Ramsay the probabilities are that Paul experienced at Troas some delay in continuing his journey. In starting from Troas he had therefore to choose a vessel making no break in its voyage except at Miletus, or a vessel intending to stop at Ephesus, perhaps as its destination, perhaps with a previous delay elsewhere. He determined for the former by the shortness of the time, and his desire to reach Jerusalem. He may no doubt have been also influenced to some extent by the thought that it would be difficult to tear himself away from a Church which had so many claims upon him, and by the reflection that hostilities might be aroused against him and his progress further impeded (<span class="ital">cf.</span> McGiffert, p. 339, who thinks that the author’s reason for St. Paul’s desire not to visit Ephesus “is entirely satisfactory”).—<span class="greekheb">χρονοτριβ</span>.: nowhere else in N.T. or in LXX, but in Arist., Plut.—<span class="greekheb">γένηται αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch.

Whether St. Paul reached Jerusalem in time we are not told. St. Chrysostom maintained that he did, see also Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, pp. 296, 297; McGiffert, p. 340 (on the other hand, Weiss, Renan, Felten). Mr. Turner, <span class="ital">Chron. of N. T.</span>, p. 422, holds that the Apostle probably reached Jerusalem just in time, while Farrar sees in <a href="/acts/24-11.htm" title="Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.">Acts 24:11</a> an intimation that he arrived on the very eve of the Feast.

Perhaps too there might have been some hostility roused against him, and either from a wish not to awaken this or from fear lest the allaying of it should consume time he resolved to send for the heads of the church to confer with him at Miletus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because he would not spend the time in Asia</span>] Better (with <span class="ital">Rev.

There would be at such a time an opportunity for the Apostle to meet the more prominent members of the Christian body, and, while bringing his contributions from the churches which he had founded, to gladden them with the news of what God had enabled him to do.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/20-16.htm" title="For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hurried, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.">Acts 20:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔκρινε</span>) <span class="ital">determined</span>.
