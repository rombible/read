The “tears,” too, are characteristic of the Apostle, whose intense sensitiveness and sympathy had not been hardened into a Stoic apathy, and therefore found vent in a form which the Stoic would have scorned as unmanly. (Comp. <a href="/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2Corinthians 2:4</a>.) Epictetus (<span class= "ital">Enchirid.</span> c. 2) barely allowed a follower of wisdom to mourn outwardly with those who mourned, and added the warning: “Take heed that thou mourn not inwardly.”<p><span class= "bld">Temptations.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">trials</span>—the word retaining its dominant meaning of troubles coming from without, rather than allurements to evil from within. The reference to the “lying in wait of the Jews” refers, of course, to something altogether distinct from the Demetrian tumult, and implies unrecorded sufferings. The Apostle’s life was never safe, and the air was thick with plots against it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:17-27 The elders knew that Paul was no designing, self-seeking man. Those who would in any office serve the Lord acceptably, and profitably to others, must do it with humility. He was a plain preacher, one that spoke his message so as to be understood. He was a powerful preacher; he preached the gospel as a testimony to them if they received it; but as a testimony against them if they rejected it. He was a profitable preacher; one that aimed to inform their judgments, and reform their hearts and lives. He was a painful preacher, very industrious in his work. He was a faithful preacher; he did not keep back reproofs when necessary, nor keep back the preaching of the cross. He was a truly Christian, evangelical preacher; he did not preach notions or doubtful matters; nor affairs of state or the civil government; but he preached faith and repentance. A better summary of these things, without which there is no salvation, cannot be given: even repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, with their fruits and effects. Without these no sinner can escape, and with these none will come short of eternal life. Let them not think that Paul left Asia for fear of persecution; he was in full expectation of trouble, yet resolved to go on, well assured that it was by Divine direction. Thanks be to God that we know not the things which shall befall us during the year, the week, the day which has begun. It is enough for the child of God to know that his strength shall be equal to his day. He knows not, he would not know, what the day before him shall bring forth. The powerful influences of the Holy Spirit bind the true Christian to his duty. Even when he expects persecution and affliction, the love of Christ constrains him to proceed. None of these things moved Paul from his work; they did not deprive him of his comfort. It is the business of our life to provide for a joyful death. Believing that this was the last time they should see him, he appeals concerning his integrity. He had preached to them the whole counsel of God. As he had preached to them the gospel purely, so he had preached it to them entire; he faithfully did his work, whether men would bear or forbear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Serving the Lord - In the discharge of the appropriate duties of his apostolic office, and in private life. To discharge aright our duties in any vocation is serving the Lord. Religion is often represented in the Bible as a service rendered to the Lord.<p>With all humility - Without arrogance, pride, or a spirit of dictation; without a desire to "lord it over God's heritage"; without being elated with the authority of the apostolic office, the variety of the miracles which he was enabled to perform, or the success which attended his labors. What an admirable model for all who are in the ministry; for all who are endowed with talents and learning; for all who meet with remarkable success in their work! The proper effect of such success, and of such talent, will be to produce true humility. The greatest endowments are usually connected with the most simple and childlike humility.<p>And with many tears - Paul not infrequently gives evidence of the tenderness of his heart, of his regard for the souls of people, and of his deep solicitude for the salvation of sinners, <a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>. The particular thing, however, here specified as producing weeping was the opposition of the Jews. But it cannot be supposed that those tears were shed from an apprehension of personal danger. It was rather because the opposition of the Jews impeded his work, and retarded his progress in winning souls to Christ. A minister of the gospel will:<p>(1) Feel, and deeply feel for the salvation of his people. He will weep over their condition when he sees theta going astray, and in danger of perishing. He will,<p>(2) Be specially affected with opposition, because it will retard his work, and prevent the progress and the triumph of the gospel. It is not because it is a personal concern, but because it is the cause of his Master.<p>And temptations - Trials arising from their opposition. We use the word "temptation" in a more limited sense, to denote inducements offered to one to lead him into sin. The word in the Scriptures most commonly denotes "trials" of any kind.<p>Which befell me - Which happened to me; which Iencountered.<p>By the lying in wait ... - By their snares and plots against my life. Compare <a href="/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>. Those snares and plans were designed to blast his reputation and to destroy his usefulness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

On its use in N.T. and LXX see Hatch, <span class="ital">Essays in Biblical Greek</span>, p. 71 ff., and compare Mayor, <span class="ital">Epistle of</span> <span class="ital">St. James</span>, <a href="/james/1-2.htm" title="My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;">Jam 1:2</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν Ἰ</span>.: evidently classed amongst the <span class="greekheb">πειρασμῶν</span>, Hatch, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, although we must not suppose that St. Luke tells us of all the Apostle’s dangers, trials and temptations here any more than elsewhere. Nothing of the kind is mentioned in connection definitely with the Ephesian Jews, “sed res minime dubia, <a href="/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a>,” Blass. The noun has not been found in any classical author, but it occurs in Dioscorides, <span class="ital">Præf.</span>, i., see Grimm, <span class="ital">sub v.</span>, and several times in LXX, six times in Ecclus. and in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-52.htm" title="Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness?">1Ma 2:52</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">serving … humility of mind</span>] The <span class="ital">Rev.

Probably the translators of 1611 did not like the collocation <span class="ital">all lowliness</span>.

In <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2 Corinthians 2:4</a> St Paul says “I wrote unto you with <span class="ital">many</span> tears.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews</span>] The old sense of “temptation” is lost.

We could only see in the account of the tumult at Ephesus that there were some indications that the Jewish population were anxious to make it plain that they had no sympathy with the Apostle who was so obnoxious to the Gentiles. Here we have an express declaration made before those who knew all the circumstances that plots had been laid against Paul’s life by the Jews. It did not fall in with St Luke’s purpose to tell us of them, but he manifestly knew about them, for he feels no difficulty in recording the Apostle’s own mention of them here, nor has he a thought that his narrative will be held for other than true, though men may point out here an allusion to events of which he had made no mention before. We cannot too often bear in mind that the book is not meant for a history of either one or other Apostle, but a record of how the course of the Gospel was guided according to Christ’s injunction, “beginning at Jerusalem” and ending when an Apostle had proclaimed Christ in the Imperial capital.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δουλεύων</span>, <span class="ital">serving</span>) A noble idea of the servant of the Lord.—<span class="greekheb">τῶ Κυρίῳ</span>) <span class="ital">the Lord</span>, whose is the Church.—<span class="greekheb">μετὰ</span>, <span class="ital">with</span>) <span class="ital">Humility of mind, tears</span>, and <span class="ital">temptations</span>, are the concomitants (of <span class="ital">service</span>): the act of <span class="ital">serving</span> itself is described in the foll. verse.—<span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνης</span>, <span class="ital">humility of mind</span>) This he recommends to the Ephesians also in <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm" title="With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;">Ephesians 4:2</a>, “with all <span class="ital">lowliness</span>,” <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνης</span>.—<span class="greekheb">δακρύων</span>, <span class="ital">tears</span>) <a href="/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Php 3:18</a>.
