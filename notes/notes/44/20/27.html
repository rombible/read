So in the Epistle to the Ephesians, which, even on the assumption that it was an encyclical letter, was addressed to them principally, he speaks to them as able to understand his knowledge in the mystery of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm" title="Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)">Ephesians 3:4</a>), the universality of His redeeming work, the brotherhood of mankind in the common Fatherhood of God. In “I have not shunned” we have the same word and image as in the “kept back” of <a href="/acts/20-20.htm" title="And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,">Acts 20:20</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:17-27 The elders knew that Paul was no designing, self-seeking man. Those who would in any office serve the Lord acceptably, and profitably to others, must do it with humility. He was a plain preacher, one that spoke his message so as to be understood. He was a powerful preacher; he preached the gospel as a testimony to them if they received it; but as a testimony against them if they rejected it. He was a profitable preacher; one that aimed to inform their judgments, and reform their hearts and lives. He was a painful preacher, very industrious in his work. He was a faithful preacher; he did not keep back reproofs when necessary, nor keep back the preaching of the cross. He was a truly Christian, evangelical preacher; he did not preach notions or doubtful matters; nor affairs of state or the civil government; but he preached faith and repentance. A better summary of these things, without which there is no salvation, cannot be given: even repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, with their fruits and effects. Without these no sinner can escape, and with these none will come short of eternal life. Let them not think that Paul left Asia for fear of persecution; he was in full expectation of trouble, yet resolved to go on, well assured that it was by Divine direction. Thanks be to God that we know not the things which shall befall us during the year, the week, the day which has begun. It is enough for the child of God to know that his strength shall be equal to his day. He knows not, he would not know, what the day before him shall bring forth. The powerful influences of the Holy Spirit bind the true Christian to his duty. Even when he expects persecution and affliction, the love of Christ constrains him to proceed. None of these things moved Paul from his work; they did not deprive him of his comfort. It is the business of our life to provide for a joyful death. Believing that this was the last time they should see him, he appeals concerning his integrity. He had preached to them the whole counsel of God. As he had preached to them the gospel purely, so he had preached it to them entire; he faithfully did his work, whether men would bear or forbear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For - This verse contains a reason for what had been said in the previous verse. It shows why Paul regarded himself as innocent if they should be lost.<p>I have not shunned - I have not kept back; I have not been deterred by fear, by the desire of popularity, by the fact that the doctrines of the gospel are unpalatable to people, from declaring them fully. The proper meaning of the word translated here, "I have not shunned" &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  hupesteilame&#772;n, is "to disguise any important truth; to withdraw it from public view; to decline publishing it from fear, or an apprehension of the consequences." Paul means that he had not disguised any truth; he had not withdrawn or kept it from open view, by any apprehension of the effect which it might have on their minds. Truth may be disguised or kept back:<p>(1) By avoiding the subject altogether from timidity, or from an apprehension of giving offence if it is openly proclaimed; or,<p>(2) By giving it too little prominency, so that it shall be lost in the multitude of other truths; or,<p>(3) By presenting it amidst a web of metaphysical speculations, and entangling it with other subjects; or,<p>(4) By making use of other terms than the Bible does, for the purpose of involving it in a mist, so that it cannot be understood.<p>People may resort to this course:<p>(1) Because the truth itself is unpalatable;<p>(2) Because they may apprehend the loss of reputation or support;<p>(3) Because they may not love the truth them selves, and choose to conceal its prominent and offensive points;<p>(4) Because they may be afraid of the rich, the great, and the frivolous, and apprehend that they shall excite their indignation; and,<p>(5) By a love of metaphysical philosophy, and a constant effort to bring everything to the test of their own reason. People often preach a philosophical explanation of a doctrine instead of the doctrine itself They deserve the credit of ingenuity, but not that of being open and bold proclaimers of the truth of God.<p>All the counsel - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;  pasan te&#772;n boule&#772;n. The word "counsel" (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;  boule&#772;) denotes properly "consolation, deliberation," and then "will or purpose," <a href="/luke/23-51.htm">Luke 23:51</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>. It means here the will or purpose of God, as revealed in regard to the salvation of people. Paul had made a full statement of that plan of the guilt of people, of the claims of the Law, of the need of a Saviour, of the provisions of mercy, and of the state of future rewards and punishments. Ministers ought to declare all that counsel, because God commands it; because it is needful for the salvation of people; and because the message is not theirs, but God's, and they have no right to change, to disguise, or to withhold it. And if it is the duty of ministers to declare that counsel, it is the duty of a people to listen to it with respect and candor, and with a desire to know the truth, and to be saved by it. Declaring the counsel of God will do no good unless it is received into honest and humble hearts, and with a disposition to know what God has revealed for salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

No Epistle excels that to the Ephesians in the richness of its thoughts, and in its conception of a divine purpose running through the ages; no Epistle dwells more fully upon the conception of the Church as the Body of Christ, or exhorts more touchingly to diligence in keeping the unity of the Spirit, or insists more practically upon the sanctifying power of the One Spirit, and the sense of a divine membership in every sphere of human life. The rich and full teaching of the Epistle is addressed to men who are able to understand the Apostle’s knowledge of the mystery of Christ; in other words, to those to whom he had announced more fully than to others the counsel of God. The Ephesian Epistle may have been an encyclical letter, but it was addressed principally to the Ephesians as the representatives of the leading Church of the province of Asia.
