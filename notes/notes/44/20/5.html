As in this verse the change of pronoun indicates that the writer of the narrative again becomes a fellow-traveller with St Paul, we may presume, as has before been said, that he had been left here by the Apostle, who now separated himself for a brief time from his companions that he might pick up St Luke.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/acts/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν Τρωάδι</span>, <span class="ital">in Troas</span>) The name of the region and town.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- But these had gone</span> for <span class="accented">these going</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and were waiting</span> for <span class="accented">tarried</span>, A.V. The narrative is so concise that the exact details are matters of conjecture. There is consequently much difference of opinion about them. Howson, with whom Farrar (vol. 2:274) apparently agrees, thinks that the whole party traveled together by land through Bercea and Thessalonica, to Philippi; that the party consisting of Sopater, Aristarchus and Secundus, Gains, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus, went on at once from Philippi <span class="accented">via</span> Neapolis, to Troas, leaving St. Paul, who was now joined by St. Luke, at Philippi, to pass eight or nine days there during the Feast of the Passover. And this seems quite consistent with St. Luke's narrative. But Lewin (vol. it. p. 74) thinks that only St. Paul (accompanied, as he supposes, by Luke, Titus, and Jason) went to Macedonia, and that the others sailed direct from Cenchreae to Troas. Renan, on the other hand, thinks they all sailed together from Cenchreae to Neapolis, whence Paul's party went to Philippi, and the others to Troas. There is no clue to the reason why the party thus separated. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Us<p>The first person resumed, indicating that Luke had joined Paul. </body></html>
