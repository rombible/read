The order of the first two names is the same as in <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>, and as that implied in <a href="/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>; <a href="/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>. Annas, or Ananus, had been made high priest by Quirinus, the Governor of Syria, filled the office A.D. 7-15, and lived to see five of his sons occupy it after him. At this time, Joseph Caiaphas was the actual high priest (see Note on <a href="/john/11-49.htm" title="And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,">John 11:49</a>), having been appointed in A.D. 17. He was deposed A.D. 37. He had married the daughter of Annas; and the latter seems to have exercised a dominant influence, perhaps, as the <span class= "ital">Nasi, </span>the Prince, or President, of the Sanhedrin, during the remainder of his life. If he presided on this occasion, it may explain St. Luke’s calling him “the high priest.”<p><span class= "bld">John.</span>—This may have been the Johanan ben Zaccai, who is reported by Jewish writers to have been at the height of his fame forty years before the destruction of the Temple, and to have been President of the Great Synagogue after its removal to Jamnia. The identification is, at the best, uncertain; but the story told of his death-bed, in itself full of pathos, becomes, on this assumption, singularly interesting. His disciples asked him why he wept: “O light or Israel, . . . . whence these tears?” And he replied: “If I were going to appear before a king of flesh and blood, he is one who to-day is and to-morrow is in the grave; if he were wroth with me, his wrath is not eternal; if he were to cast me into chains, those chains are not for ever; if he slay me, that death is not eternal; I might soothe him with words or appease him with a gift. But they are about to bring me before the King of kings, the Lord, the Holy and Blessed One, who liveth and abideth for ever. And if He is wroth with me, His wrath is eternal; and if He bind, His bonds are eternal; if He slay, it is eternal death; and Him I cannot soothe with words or appease with gifts. And besides all this, there are before me two paths, one to Paradise and the other to Gehenna, and I know not in which they are about to lead me. How can I do aught else but weep?” (<span class= "ital">Bab-Beracoth, </span>fol. 28, in Lightfoot: <span class= "ital">Cent.-Chorogr., Acts 15</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Alexander.</span>—This name has been identified by many scholars with Alexander, the brother of Philo, the <span class= "ital">Alabarch, </span>or magistrate of Alexandria (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 8, § 1; xix. 5, § 1). There is, however, not the shadow of any evidence for the identification.<p><span class= "bld">As many as were of the kindred of the high priest.</span>—The same phrase is used by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 3, § 1), and may mean either those who were personally related by ties of blood with the high priest for the time being, or the heads of the four-and-twenty courses of priests. (See Notes on <a href="/matthew/2-4.htm" title="And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.">Matthew 2:4</a>; <a href="/luke/1-5.htm" title="THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.">Luke 1:5</a>.)

These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whom they had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus is given to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believers are saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or any corrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close their hearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant and unlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christ crucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all who converse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus. That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raises them above this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their rulers - The rulers of the Jews; doubtless the members of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation.

It is clear that they were members of the Great Council, and the mention of their names shows that the men of chief authority and influence were assembled to silence the apostles. Annas and Caiaphas had been concerned in the condemnation of Jesus, and they would now feel a special interest in arresting the progress of the gospel among the people. All the success of the gospel reflected back light upon the wicked ness of the act of condemning the Lord Jesus. And this fact may serve, in part, to account for their strong desire to silence the apostles.<p>At Jerusalem - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;  eis. This was the usual place of assembling the Sanhedrin. But the Jewish writers (see Lightfoot on this place) say that 40 years before the destruction of the city, on account of the great increase of crime, etc., the Sanhedrin was removed from place to place. The declaration of Luke that they were now assembled in Jerusalem, seems to imply that they sometimes met in other places. It is probable that the members of the Sanhedrin were not in the city at the time mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/4-3.htm">Acts 4:3</a>, and this was the reason why the trial was deferred to the next day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

So called, either because he had been an high priest, though he was not now, but Caiaphas his son-in-law; or because he was the Sagan of the high priest, and had all the other priests under his government; and is mentioned first, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas; See Gill on <a href="/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2</a> he could not be called so, because he was  "prince", or president of the council; for not he, but Gamaliel, was president at this time. And <p>Caiaphas; who was properly high priest, and continued so for three years after the death of Christ: <p>and John; who is thought by Dr. Lightfoot to be the same with Jochanan, or John ben Zaccai; a famous Jewish Rabbi, who lived at this time, and until, and after the destruction of Jerusalem: this Rabbi was  "a priest" (t), as this John was, of the kindred of the high priest; he lived also at Jerusalem; for it is said of him (u), that he sat in the shadow of the temple, and expounded all the whole day; and a very remarkable story is told of him, which happened just about this time (w); which is, that <p>"forty years before the destruction of the temple--the doors of the temple opened of themselves, when Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai reproved them, saying, O temple, temple, wherefore dost thou fright thyself?

"Open thy doors, O Lebanon", &amp;c.'' <p>The chief objection to him, as that learned writer observes, is, that he lived and died a Pharisee, whereas this John seems to have been a Sadducee; see <a href="/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>. This puts me in mind of John the high priest, who ministered in the high priesthood fourscore years, and at last became a Sadducee (x): Beza's ancient copy reads "Jonathan: and Alexander"; whose surname was Lysimachus, and had the title of "Alabarcha"; he was a very rich man (y): after Alexander the great had been at Jerusalem, this name became frequent among the Jews; and it is said (z) to be promised him, and was fulfilled, that every son that was born to the priests that year he entered Jerusalem, should be called Alexander; and therefore it is no wonder to hear of an Alexander among the kindred of the high priest; frequent mention is made of , "Rabbi Alexander", in the Jewish writings (a): <p>and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest; by whose means they were become members of the sanhedrim: <p>were gathered together at Jerusalem; where the great council only sat, until the destruction of it; it seems by this, that some of the members of it lived in the country; it may be in some of the villages adjacent, where they might be easily and quickly sent for, upon any occasion, as they very likely now were; the Syriac version leaves out the words "at Jerusalem". <p>(t) Juchasin, fol. 20. 2.((u) T.

Josephus certainly appears to extend the title to ex-high priests, and so in the N.T. where <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεῖς</span> appear at the head of the Sanhedrim as in this passage (<span class="greekheb">ἄρχοντες</span>), the ex-high priests are to be understood, first and foremost, as well as the high-priest actually in office. The difficulty here is that the title is given to Annas alone, and this seems to involve that he was also regarded as president of the Sadducees, whereas it is always the actual <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεύς</span> who presides, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>; <a href="/acts/7-1.htm" title="Then said the high priest, Are these things so?">Acts 7:1</a>; <a href="/acts/9-1.htm" title="And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,">Acts 9:1</a>; <a href="/acts/22-5.htm" title="As also the high priest does bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound to Jerusalem, for to be punished.">Acts 22:5</a>; <a href="/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2</a>; <a href="/acts/23-4.htm" title="And they that stood by said, Revile you God's high priest?">Acts 23:4</a>; <a href="/acts/24-1.htm" title="And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.">Acts 24:1</a>. But not only is the laxity of the term to be considered, but also the fact that Annas on account of his influence as the head of the <span class="greekheb">γένος ἀρχιερατικόν</span> may have remained the presiding <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεύς</span> in spite of all the rapid changes in the tenure of the high-priestly office under the Romans. These changes the Jews would not recognise as valid, and if the early chapters of Acts came to St. Luke as seems probable from Jewish Christian sources, Annas might easily be spoken of as high-priest. His relationship to Caiaphas helps to explain the influence and power of Annas. On Hamburger’s view (<span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie des Judentums</span>, ii., 8, p. 1151,“Synhedrion”), that a Rabbi and not the high-priest presided over the Sadducees, see Edersheim, <span class="ital">History of the Jewish Nation</span>, p. 522, and Schürer, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 180. For Annas, see Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xviii., 2, 12, xx., 9, 1, and see further “Annas” in B.D.2 and Hastings’ B.D.—<span class="greekheb">Ἰωάννης</span>: identified by J. Lightfoot (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also Wetstein) with the famous Johanan ben Zacchai, president of the Great Synagogue after its removal to Jamnia, who obtained leave from Vespasian for many of the Jews to settle in the place. But the identification is very uncertain, and does not appear to commend itself to Schürer; see critical note above.—<span class="greekheb">Ἀλέξανδρος</span>: of him too nothing is known, as there is no confirmatory evidence to identify him with the brother of Philo, alabarch of Alexandria, and the first man of his time amongst the Jews of that city, Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xviii., 8, 1, xix., 5, 1, xx., 5, B.D.2 and Hastings’ B. D., “Alexander”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/acts/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">and Annas the high priest</span>] was there. The verb is understood. Annas (called Ananus in Josephus), son of one Seth, was made high-priest (a.d. 7) by the Roman governor Quirinus [Cyrenius], and so continued till a.d. 14 (Joseph. <span class="ital">Antiq</span>. xviii. 2. 1). We do not find that he was ever again appointed to the office, though St Luke here calls him high-priest. But the way in which he is mentioned at the time of the trial of Christ, who was brought, as we read, before Annas first (<a href="/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>), and sent by him afterwards bound unto Caiaphas, shews that, though not actual high-priest, yet his position in the eyes of the people of Jerusalem was one which justified them in bringing Jesus to him as soon as he was seized. It is difficult to explain from the words of the New Test, the relation of these two men in their office. Caiaphas is expressly called high-priest by St John, yet we are not told why Christ was not at once brought to him. It may be that one was acting high-priest, while the other was <span class="ital">nasi</span> or president of the Sanhedrin. Moreover it is not improbable that Annas, having been high-priest before, and only deposed from the office by the Roman governor Gratus, would, both during the short high-priesthood of his son Eleazar (a.d. 16), and the longer high-priesthood of Caiaphas, his son-in-law (a.d. 25–37), exercise much influence by reason of his age and experience, and might, from his former tenure of the office, even be spoken of as high-priest. It is clear that he was at the head of one of the most influential Jewish families, for before his death, five of his sons had been high-priests (Joseph. <span class="ital">Antiq</span>. xx. 9. 1). We can see from <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>, where both Annas and Caiaphas are said to be high-priests, that there was some laxity in the common use of the title. So far only does the New Testament carry us, but when we come to examine the Old Testament, and the records of later Jewish literature, there seems every reason to conclude that the expressions which seem somewhat hard to reconcile are exactly those which would naturally be employed. We find that Moses, who is himself counted (<a href="/psalms/99-6.htm" title="Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call on his name; they called on the LORD, and he answered them.">Psalm 99:6</a>) God’s priest on the same level with Aaron, anointed not Aaron only, but his sons at the same time (<a href="/context/exodus/40-12.htm" title="And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water....">Exodus 40:12-15</a>) to be high-priests. Also (<a href="/numbers/31-6.htm" title="And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.">Numbers 31:6</a>) Phinehas the son of Eleazar is sent to the war against the Midianites with “the holy instruments” (Le. the Urim and Thummim), which shews that he was high-priest at the same time as Eleazar his father. Again in later times (<a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2 Kings 25:18</a>) we have mention made of “Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest,” which the Targum explain as “high-priest and Sagan” or deputy high-priest. The Talmud makes it very clear that there was a special arrangement for providing on some occasions such a deputy for the high-priest. Thus (Mishna <span class="ital">Joma</span> i. 1) it says, “Seven days before the day of atonement they remove the high-priest from his house to the chamber of the assessors, and they provide another priest in his place lest any disqualification should befal him.” On this passage Rashi’s note is “<span class="ital">to be high-priest instead of him</span>.” and a little later on in the same treatise (T. B. <span class="ital">Joma</span> 39 a) it is said concerning the services of the day of atonement: “Rabbi Khanina the Sagan of the priests (and so one qualified to speak on the duties of the office) said: Why does the Sagan stand on the right hand of the high-priest (when the lots are being cast for the goats)?” The answer is, “So that if any disqualification should befal him, the Sagan may go in (to the Holy of Holies) and perform the service in his stead.” Cp. also <span class="ital">Midrash Rabbah</span> on Leviticus (par. 20 <span class="ital">ad fin</span>.). “If there was any defilement on Aaron, Eleazar served (as high-priest), and if there was any defilement on Eleazar, Ithamar served.” (On the slight matters which caused such ceremonial defilement, see note on <a href="/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>.) And in the same chapter we find “Had not Elisheba (<a href="/exodus/6-23.htm" title="And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">Exodus 6:23</a>, the wife of Aaron) joy in this world who saw five crowns (i.e. subjects for rejoicing) in one day? her brother-in-law (Moses) a king (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm" title="And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>); her brother (Naashon) <span class="ital">nasi</span>, i.e. president, of the tribe of Judah; her husband high-priest; her two sons, sagans of the high-priest; and Phinehas her grandson anointed for the war.” These notices make it clear that from the earliest times down to a period posterior to the date of the Acts, there were occasions, and these not unfrequent, when two men were called high-priests at the same time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That one who had been high-priest should still retain the title may be seen from the principle laid down in several places in the Talmud, (see Mishna <span class="ital">Shekalim</span> vi. 6, <span class="ital">ed. princ. Jerus</span>.), viz. that “you may elevate in a sacred office or service, but you cannot bring down,” as with us “once a Bishop, always a Bishop.” The illustration given is that you might lay the shewbread on a marble table first, and afterwards on a golden one, but the contrary order of proceeding was forbidden. (For another illustration, see note on <a href="/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3</a>.) Therefore Annas, having been high-priest, could, according to Jewish usage, never be called by any lower title.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The relationship between Annas and Caiaphas and the seniority of the former is enough to explain the conduct of the crowd in bringing Jesus to him first: while the omission of the word high-priest (<a href="/acts/4-6.htm" title="And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.">Acts 4:6</a>) with the name of Caiaphas is no more a proof that he was not also known to be high-priest, as well as Annas, than the words of St Mark’s Gospel (<a href="/acts/16-7.htm" title="After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.">Acts 16:7</a>), “Go your way, tell his disciples and Peter,” can be made evidence that Peter was not one of the disciples. For a similar phrase cp. <a href="/acts/5-29.htm" title="Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.">Acts 5:29</a> and the note there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Caiaphas</span>] He was also called Joseph, and was son-in-law to Annas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and John</span>] This is the same name as Johanan, and Lightfoot concludes that this person was the famous Johanan ben Zaccai, who by his influence with Vespasian procured permission for many of the Jews to settle in Jamnia (Yavneh) after the destruction of their city, and himself became head of the synagogue there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Alexander</span>] of whom nothing is known more than can be gathered from this mention of him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest</span>] And these would probably all be of the Sadducees’ party.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">were gathered together at</span> (MSS. <span class="bld">in</span>) <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>] These words which A.

He is called by Josephus, <span class="accented">Ananus.</span> The succession of the high priests was so irregular, and their tenure of the office so uncertain, in these later years of the Jewish commonwealth, being dependent upon the caprice of the civil rulers who appointed and deposed them at their pleasure, that it does not surprise us to find Annas and Caiaphas high priests at the commencement of John the Baptist's ministry, then Caiaphas at the time of our Lord's passion, and now Annas again. It is possible, however, that Annas may have continued to be president of the Sanhedrim, and be called high priest, even when not actually so. He seems to have lived to old age. He is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20, 60:1) as having had the singular felicity not only of enjoying the high priesthood himself for a great length of time, but of having five sons promoted to the dignity of high priest, viz. Eleazar, Jonathan, Theophilus, Mat-thins, and Ananus (or Annas). <span class="cmt_word">Caiaphas</span> (<a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>). Of <span class="cmt_word">John</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Alexander</span> nothing further is known, but Farrar conjectures that John may be "the celebrated Johanan Ben Zakkai, and Alexander perhaps the wealthy brother of Philo" ('Life of St. Paul,' 1. p. 107). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kindred of the high priest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the high priestly race.</span> The high priests were only taken from certain families; the members of which were called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, or chief priests, A.V. (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-47.htm">Matthew 26:47</a>, etc.), Many of these would naturally be the near relations of the high priest. </body></html>
