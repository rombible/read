The joint utterance described may be conceived as the result either (1) of a direct inspiration, suggesting the same words to all who were present; (2) of the people following St. Peter, clause by clause; (3) of the hymn being already familiar to the disciples. On the whole, (2) seems the most probable, the special fitness of the hymn for the occasion being against (3), and (1) involving a miracle of so startling a nature that we can hardly take it for granted without a more definite statement. The recurrence of St. Luke’s favourite phrase (see Note on <a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>) should not be passed over.<p><span class= "bld">Lord.</span>—The Greek word is not the common one for Lord (<span class= "ital">Kyrios</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but <span class= "ital">Despotes, </span>the absolute Master of the Universe. It is a coincidence worth noting that, though but seldom used of God in the New Testament, it occurs again, as used by the two Apostles who take part in it, as in <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>, and <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a>. (See Note on <a href="/luke/2-29.htm" title="Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace, according to your word:">Luke 2:29</a>.) In the Greek version of the Old Testament it is found applied to the Angel of Jehovah in <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm" title="And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come.

The hymn has the special interest of being the earliest recorded utterance of the praises of the Christian Church. As such, it is significant that it begins, as so many of the Psalms begin, with setting forth the glory of God as the Creator, and rises from that to the higher redemptive work. More strict, “<span class= "ital">the</span> heaven, <span class= "ital">the</span> earth, and <span class= "ital">the</span> sea,” each region of creation being contemplated in its distinctness.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:23-31 Christ's followers do best in company, provided it is their own company. It encourages God's servants, both in doing work, and suffering work, that they serve the God who made all things, and therefore has the disposal of all events; and the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Jesus was anointed to be a Saviour, therefore it was determined he should be a sacrifice, to make atonement for sin. But sin is not the less evil for God's bringing good out of it. In threatening times, our care should not be so much that troubles may be prevented, as that we may go on with cheerfulness and courage in our work and duty. They do not pray, Lord let us go away from our work, now that it is become dangerous, but, Lord, give us thy grace to go on stedfastly in our work, and not to fear the face of man. Those who desire Divine aid and encouragement, may depend upon having them, and they ought to go forth, and go on, in the strength of the Lord God. God gave a sign of acceptance of their prayers. The place was shaken, that their faith might be established and unshaken. God gave them greater degrees of his Spirit; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than ever; by which they were not only encouraged, but enabled to speak the word of God with boldness. When they find the Lord God help them by his Spirit, they know they shall not be confounded, Isa 1.7.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They lifted up their voice - To lift up the voice, among the Hebrews, was a phrase denoting either an "address" to the people <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>, or a phrase expressive of "weeping" <a href="/genesis/29-11.htm">Genesis 29:11</a>; <a href="/judges/2-4.htm">Judges 2:4</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-9.htm">Ruth 1:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm">1 Samuel 24:16</a>, or of "prayer."

From this word is derived the word "despot." This is not the usual word employed by which to address God. The word commonly translated "Lord" is &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Kurios. The word used here denotes "one who rules over others," and was applied to the highest magistrate or officer. It denotes "authority; power; absoluteness in ruling." It is a word denoting more authority in ruling than the other. That more commonly denotes a property in a thing; this denotes "absolute rule."

The word must not be pressed to mean that they all simultaneously gave utterance to the same words, or that they were able to do so, because they were repeating a familiar Hymn; it may mean that the Hymn was uttered by one of the leaders, by St. Peter, or St. James (Zöckler), and answered by the responsive Amen of the rest, or that the words were caught up by the multitude of believers as they were uttered by an inspired Apostle (so Felten, Rendall).—<span class="greekheb">ἦραν φωνήν</span>: the same phrase is used in <a href="/luke/17-13.htm" title="And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.">Luke 17:13</a>, so in <a href="/acts/2-14.htm" title="But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my words:">Acts 2:14</a>; <a href="/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a>; <a href="/acts/22-22.htm" title="And they gave him audience to this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.">Acts 22:22</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπαίρειν</span>, and also in <a href="/luke/11-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which you have sucked.">Luke 11:27</a>.

The Creator even by miracles refutes them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- They, when they heard it, lifted</span> for <span class="accented">when they heard that they lifted</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">O Lord, thou that didst make</span>, or as in margin, <span class="accented">thou art he that did make</span>, for <span class="accented">Lord, thou art God, which hast made</span>, T.R. and A.V.; the <span class="accented">heaven and the earth</span> for heaven <span class="accented">and earth</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">With one accord</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs eleven times in the Acts (ten times in the R.T.) and only once elsewhere in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>. O Lord, etc. Either the margin or the A.V. is preferable to the R.V., which gives an unmeaning vocative pendent. The word here used for "Lord" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, from which our English word "despot" comes. It means "master, owner," in respect of slaves, and "a lord" or "king," whose power over his subjects is similar to that of a master over slaves. Here, with reference to creation and God's unlimited power overall that he has made, the Church in danger finds support and solace in the thought of God's absolute sovereignty. The term is applied to God in the New Testament elsewhere only in <a href="/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29</a> (where observe its relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>, R.T.

In the LXX. it sometimes answers to <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and sometimes to <span class="accented">Adonai.</span> As regards the question how the whole assembly joined in this prayer, whether by a common inspiration, or by repeating the words after him that prayed them aloud (Alford), or by merely singing the second psalm (Baumgarten), or by all using what was already a formulary prepared for the needs of the Church (Meyer), it is difficult to speak positively, nor is it of any moment. Another possible explanation is that several members of the congregation, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, uttered brief prayers and praises, the consenting matter of which Luke thus puts together. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/acts/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Lord (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. </body></html>
