The coincidence of names in the juxtaposition of the representatives of the new and the older Israel is striking. On each side there was a John; on each a Cephas, or Caiaphas, the two names possibly coming from the same root, or, at any rate, closely alike in sound. A few weeks back Peter had quailed before the soldiers and servants in the high priest’s palace. Now he stands before the Sanhedrin and speaks, in the language of respect, it is true, but also in that of unflinching boldness. We may, perhaps, trace a greater deference in the language of the Galilean fisherman, “Ye rulers of the people,” than in the “Men and brethren” of St. Paul (<a href="/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.">Acts 23:6</a>), who was more familiar with the members of the court, and stood in less awe of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/4-8.htm" title="Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them, You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,...">Acts 4:8-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost </span>— That moment, according to the promise of his now glorified Master, (<a href="/matthew/10-20.htm" title="For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.">Matthew 10:20</a>; <a href="/mark/13-11.htm" title="But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what you shall speak, neither do you premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak you: for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.">Mark 13:11</a>,) which was upon this occasion remarkably verified; <span class="ital">said unto them </span>— With the utmost freedom; <span class="ital">Ye rulers of the people, &c</span>. — He gives them the honour due to their office. <span class="ital">If we this day be examined — </span>And called to an account as criminals, about <span class="ital">the good deed </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ευεργεσια</span>, the <span class="ital">good work, </span>or <span class="ital">benefit, </span>done to the impotent man, and you want us to declare <span class="ital">by what means he is </span>delivered from his calamitous state, and <span class="ital">made whole </span>— <span class="greekheb">Σεσωσται</span>, is cured or saved: <span class="ital">be it known unto you </span>— Probably the herald of God proclaimed this with a loud voice: <span class="ital">that by the name of Jesus, whom ye </span>lately <span class="ital">crucified </span>— With all the marks of detestation and contempt, as a criminal worthy of the most infamous death, but <span class="ital">whom God raised from the dead </span>— These rulers and elders knew in their own consciences that it was so.

He therein follows the admirable custom of his great Lord and Master, who continually took occasion from earthly to speak of heavenly things.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:5-14 Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost, would have all to understand, that the miracle had been wrought by the name, or power, of Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, whom they had crucified; and this confirmed their testimony to his resurrection from the dead, which proved him to be the Messiah. These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whom they had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus is given to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believers are saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or any corrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close their hearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant and unlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christ crucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all who converse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus. That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raises them above this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Filled with the Holy Ghost - See the notes on <a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>.<p>Ye rulers ... - Peter addressed the Sanhedrin with perfect respect. He did not call in question their authority to propose this question. He seemed to regard this as a favorable opportunity to declare the truth and state the evidence of the Christian religion. In this he acted on the principle of the injunction which he himself afterward gave <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, "Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear." Innocence is willing to be questioned; and a believer in the truth will rejoice in any opportunity to state the evidence of what is believed. It is remarkable, also, that this was before the Great Council of the nation - the body that was clothed with the highest authority. Peter could not have forgotten that before this very council, and these very men, his Master had been arraigned and condemned; nor could he have forgotten that in the very room where this same council was convened to try his Lord, he had himself shrunk from an honest avowal of attachment to him, and shamefully and profanely denied him.<p>That he was now able to stand boldly before this same tribunal evinced a remarkable change in his feelings, and was a most clear and impressive proof of the genuineness of his repentance when he went out and wept bitterly. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-54.htm">Luke 22:54-62</a>. And we may remark here, that one of the most clear evidences of the sincerity of repentance is when it leads to a result like this. So deeply was the heart of Peter affected by his sin <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-62.htm">Luke 22:62</a>, and so genuine was his sorrow, that he doubtless remembered his crime on this occasion, and the memory of it inspired him with boldness. It may be further remarked, that one evidence of the genuineness of repentance is a desire to repair the evil which is done by crime. Peter had done dishonor to his Master and his cause in the presence of the great council of the nation. Nothing, on such an occasion, would be more likely to do injury to the cause than for one of the disciples of the Saviour to deny him - one of his followers to be guilty of profaneness and falsehood. But here was an opportunity, in some degree, at least, to repair the evil. Before the same council, in the same city, and in the presence. of the same people, it is not an unnatural supposition that Peter rejoiced that he might have opportunity to bear his testimony to the divine mission of the Saviour whom he had before denied. By using the customary language of respect applied to the Great Council, Peter also has shown us that it is proper to evince respect for office and for those in power. Religion requires us to render this homage, and to treat men in office with deference, <a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>; <a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The phrase <span class="greekheb">πλησθῆναι πνεύμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>. is peculiar to St. Luke, in Gospel three times, <a href="/luke/1-15.htm" title="For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.">Luke 1:15</a>; <a href="/luke/1-41.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:">Luke 1:41</a>; <a href="/luke/1-67.htm" title="And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,">Luke 1:67</a>, and <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/4-31.htm" title="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.">Acts 4:31</a>; <a href="/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>; <a href="/acts/13-9.htm" title="Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him.">Acts 13:9</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/12-12.htm" title="For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.">Luke 12:12</a>; <a href="/luke/21-14.htm" title="Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you shall answer:">Luke 21:14</a>; see also <a href="/matthew/10-20.htm" title="For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.">Matthew 10:20</a>, <a href="/mark/13-11.htm" title="But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what you shall speak, neither do you premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak you: for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.">Mark 13:11</a>. St. Peter’s courage in thus openly proclaiming the Crucified for the first time before the rulers of his people might well be significantly emphasised, as in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm" title="Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.">Acts 4:13</a>.

As the existing time (exigency) in each instance demands, so GOD moves His instruments.
