They should have placed them at the head of their council, received their doctrine, been baptized by them, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and joined in fellowship with them. But, when men will not be persuaded to do what they ought to do, it is no marvel that they are continually at a loss what to do. The truths of Christ, if men would but entertain them as they should, would give them no manner of trouble and uneasiness; but if they hold, or imprison them in unrighteousness, (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>,) they will find them a burdensome stone, that they will not know what to do with, <a href="/zechariah/12-4.htm" title="In that day, said the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.">Zechariah 12:4</a>. <span class="ital">For that a notable miracle,</span> — <span class="greekheb">Γνωστον</span>, <span class="ital">a signal </span>and <span class="ital">well-known </span>miracle: it was known that they had done it in Christ’s name, and that Christ himself had often done similar miracles: this was a known instance of the power of Christ, and a proof of his doctrine. That it was a great miracle, and wrought for the confirmation of the doctrine they preached, being <span class="greekheb">σημειον</span>, <span class="ital">a sign, was manifest to all that dwelt in Jerusalem </span>— The miracle being wrought at the gate of the temple, universal notice was taken of it; and they themselves, with all the craft, and all the effrontery they had, could not deny it to be a true miracle. Hence they concluded that it would be neither reasonable nor safe to punish these men now. Nevertheless, on the other hand, they judged that both their credit and their interest required them to suppress the rumour of it as far as they could, and therefore, said they, <span class="ital">that it spread no further</span> <span class="ital">among the people </span>— And be a means of raising discontent, and, perhaps, of occasioning some dangerous insurrection among them; <span class="ital">let us straitly threaten them </span>— <span class="greekheb">Απειλη απειλησωμεθα αυτοις</span>, <span class="ital">Let us threaten them with threatening: </span>the expression is a Hebraism, being, it seems, St. Luke’s translation of the very words of the council into Greek; <span class="ital">that they speak henceforth to no man — </span>To no individual whatever; <span class="ital">in this </span>obnoxious <span class="ital">name </span>— They could not prove that they had said or done any thing amiss, any thing but what was proper, yea, necessary to be said and done; and yet they must no more say or do the like!

Those who know how to put a just value upon Christ's promises, know how to put just contempt upon the world's threatenings. The apostles look with concern on perishing souls, and know they cannot escape eternal ruin but by Jesus Christ, therefore they are faithful in warning, and showing the right way. None will enjoy peace of mind, nor act uprightly, till they have learned to guide their conduct by the fixed standard of truth, and not by the shifting opinions and fancies of men. Especially beware of a vain attempt to serve two masters, God and the world; the end will be, you can serve neither fully.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What shall we do to these men? - The object which they had in view was evidently to prevent their preaching. The miracle was performed, and it was believed by the people to have been made. This they could not expect to be able successfully to deny. Their only object, therefore, was to prevent the apostles from making the use which they saw they would to convince the people that Jesus was the Messiah. The question was, in what way they should prevent this; whether by putting them to death, by imprisoning them, or by scourging them; or whether by simply exerting theft authority and forbidding them. From the former they were deterred, doubtless, by fear of the multitude; and they therefore adopted the latter, and seemed to suppose that the mere exertion of their authority would be sufficient to deter them from this in future.<p>The council - Greek: The "Sanhedrin." This body was composed of 71 or 72 persons, and was entrusted with the principal affairs of the nation. It was a body of vast influence and power, and hence they supposed that their command might be sufficient to restrain ignorant Galileans from speaking. Before this same body, and probably the same men, our Saviour was arraigned, and by them condemned before he was delivered to the Roman governor, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59</a>, etc. And before this same body, and in the presence of the same men, Peter had just before denied his Lord, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-70.htm">Matthew 26:70</a>, etc. The fact that the disciples had fled on a former occasion, and that Peter had denied his Saviour, may hate operated to induce them to believe that they would be terrified by their threats, and deterred from preaching publicly in the name of Jesus.<p>A notable miracle - A known, undeniable miracle.<p>That it spread - That the knowledge of it may not spread among them any further.<p>Let us straitly threaten them - Greek: "Let us threaten them with a threat." This is a "Hebraism" expressing intensity, certainty, etc. The threat was a command <a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18</a> not to teach, implying their displeasure if they did do it. This threat, however, was not effectual. On the next occasion, which occurred soon after <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a>, they added beating to their threats in order to deter them from preaching in the name of Jesus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-17. perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men&#8212;that is, uninstructed in the learning of the Jewish schools, and of the common sort; men in private life, untrained to teaching.<p>took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus&#8212;recognized them as having been in His company; remembering possibly, that they had seen them with Him [Meyer, Bloomfield, Alford]; but, more probably, perceiving in their whole bearing what identified them with Jesus: that is, "We thought we had got rid of Him; but lo! He reappears in these men, and all that troubled us in the Nazarene Himself has yet to be put down in these His disciples." What a testimony to these primitive witnesses!
