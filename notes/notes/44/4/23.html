<span class="ital">they lifted up their voice to God with one accord — </span>All unanimously joining in the following petition, as being all influenced by the same spirit, though, perhaps, only one speaking in the name of the rest: or, as Dr. Doddridge supposes, all their voices joining by immediate inspiration, a circumstance which he thinks was graciously adapted to encourage them to suffer the greatest extremities in this cause. <span class="ital">And said, Lord, thou art God, </span>&c. — The sense is, Lord, thou hast all power, and thy word is fulfilled: men rage against thee, but it is in vain. See notes on <a href="/context/psalms/2-1.htm" title="Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?...">Psalm 2:1-5</a>. <span class="ital">For of a truth, </span>&c. — For we now see the prediction of thy servant David truly and literally accomplished; since <span class="ital">against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed </span>— With the Holy Ghost and with power, to accomplish the glorious work of erecting thy kingdom among men; <span class="ital">both Herod, &c., with the Gentiles </span>— The idolatrous heathen; <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="ital">the people of Israel </span>— Professing to worship thee, the true God; <span class="ital">were gathered together — </span>Combined in the impious attempt of opposing thy designs. <span class="ital">For to do whatsoever thy hand, &c., determined before to be done</span> — That is, says Dr. Hammond, “the Roman governors and Jewish sanhedrim have joined their malicious counsels against thy holy Son; to act in the crucifying of him, and so (though little meaning it) to be the instruments of thy gracious providence and disposal, who didst determine to give thy only Son to die for us.” The sense evidently is, But they (the enemies of God and Christ) could do no more than thou wast pleased to permit, according to thy determinate counsel, to save mankind by the sufferings of thy Son. And what was needful for this end, thou didst before determine to permit to be done. Limborch, and some others, contend for a transposition of the words thus: <span class="ital">They have combined against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed to do what thy hand and thy counsel had determined, </span>&c.; but it is so expressly said elsewhere, (see <a href="/matthew/26-24.htm" title="The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.">Matthew 26:24</a>; <a href="/luke/22-22.htm" title="And truly the Son of man goes, as it was determined: but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!">Luke 22:22</a>,) that <span class="ital">the Son of man went </span>(to suffer and die) <span class="ital">as it was determined; </span>and it so plainly appears, in fact, that these circumstances were foretold, or marked out, in the prophecies of the Old Testament, that I see not, says Dr. Doddridge, “what end the admission of such a transposition would answer. It is much more rational to explain this determination in such a manner as to make it consistent with the free agency of the persons concerned. When God’s hand and his counsel are said to have determined these things, it may signify his having <span class="ital">pointed out </span>this great event, so wisely concerted in his eternal counsels, and <span class="ital">marked beforehand, </span>as it were, all the boundaries of it, (as the word <span class="greekheb">προωρισε </span>may well signify,) in the prophetic writings.” Certainly the word properly and literally signifies, <span class="ital">to define, describe, </span>or <span class="ital">mark out beforehand, </span>rather than to <span class="ital">decree, </span>or <span class="ital">predestinate. </span>“The hand of God,” says Dr. Whitby, “most frequently, in the Old Testament, relates not so much to his power, as to his wisdom, and providential dispensations; and being here joined with his counsel, and applied to what was done by Pontius Pilate and the Jews toward the crucifixion of the holy Jesus, to which actions, so highly displeasing to God, his power could not actually concur or effectively incline them, the import of these words will be no more than this, that Jews and Gentiles were assembled to accomplish those sufferings of our Saviour for mankind which God had foretold, and by foretelling had determined should come to pass: according to those words of St. Paul, <a href="/acts/13-27.htm" title="For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.">Acts 13:27</a>, <span class="ital">They who dwelt at Jerusalem, &c., not knowing the voices of the prophets, have fulfilled them by condemning him, doing all things which were</span> <span class="ital">written of him. </span>As therefore St. Peter and Paul, by calling the Jews to repentance for crucifying the Lord of life, do evidence that their sin was not the less, because they did by it fulfil the counsel of God’s holy will, and kind intentions to mankind, so do they consequently evidence, that God’s foreknowledge of a thing future, does not impair the liberty of men’s wills in the accomplishment of it; as all the ancient fathers have declared in this particular.” See this further explained in the note on <a href="/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:23-31 Christ's followers do best in company, provided it is their own company. It encourages God's servants, both in doing work, and suffering work, that they serve the God who made all things, and therefore has the disposal of all events; and the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Jesus was anointed to be a Saviour, therefore it was determined he should be a sacrifice, to make atonement for sin. But sin is not the less evil for God's bringing good out of it. In threatening times, our care should not be so much that troubles may be prevented, as that we may go on with cheerfulness and courage in our work and duty. They do not pray, Lord let us go away from our work, now that it is become dangerous, but, Lord, give us thy grace to go on stedfastly in our work, and not to fear the face of man. Those who desire Divine aid and encouragement, may depend upon having them, and they ought to go forth, and go on, in the strength of the Lord God. God gave a sign of acceptance of their prayers. The place was shaken, that their faith might be established and unshaken. God gave them greater degrees of his Spirit; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than ever; by which they were not only encouraged, but enabled to speak the word of God with boldness. When they find the Lord God help them by his Spirit, they know they shall not be confounded, Isa 1.7.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their own company - They joined the other apostles and Christians, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>.<p>And reported ... - It doubtless became a subject of interesting inquiry what they should do in this case. They had been threatened by the highest authority of the nation, and commanded not to preach again in the name of Jesus. Whether they should obey them and be silent, or whether they should leave Jerusalem and preach elsewhere, could not but be an interesting subject of inquiry, and they very properly sought the counsel of their brethren, and looked to God for direction, an example which all should follow who are exposed to persecution, or who are in any perplexity about the path of duty. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ac 4:23-37.

With this view the contents of the prayer quite accord, as it expresses the memories of that time (<a href="/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a> ff.) and the exigencies (vv 29, 30) of the threatened church in general with energetic precision, but yet takes <span class="ital">no special</span> notice of what had just happened to Peter and John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">address</span> continues to the end of <a href="/acts/4-26.htm" title="The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.">Acts 4:26</a>.
