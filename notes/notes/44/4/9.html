These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whom they had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus is given to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believers are saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or any corrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close their hearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant and unlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christ crucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all who converse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus. That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raises them above this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If we this day - If as is the fact; or since we are thus examined.<p>Examined - Questioned; if the purpose is to institute an inquiry into this case, or since it is the purpose to institute such an inquiry.<p>The good deed - The act of benevolence; the benefit conferred on an infirm man.
