Others refer it to those who were nearly related to Annas and Caiaphas: but Grotius thinks it includes the kindred of those who had lately been in the office of high-priest, which, he says, made them members of the sanhedrim. <span class="ital">And when they had set them in the midst </span>— Had ordered them to be brought before them, and set in the midst of the assembly; (it being the custom of the sanhedrim to sit almost in a circle;) <span class="ital">they asked, By what power </span>— “Human or diabolical, angelic or divine, have you cured this man?

From <span class="ital">us </span>you had it not, though we alone have the authority to give a commission to any man to do so.” It will cast light on this inquiry of the rulers to observe, that Josephus speaks of some of the Jews working cures by invoking the name of Solomon. And the Talmud relates some ridiculous stories of working miracles by the <span class="ital">tetragrammaton, </span>or the <span class="ital">unutterable name; </span>that is, by mentioning the word <span class="ital">Jehovah. </span>The seven sons of Sheva, mentioned <a href="/context/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches....">Acts 19:13-17</a>, had the same opinion of working miracles by the mention of a name, when they pretended to cure a possessed person by invoking the name of Jesus, whom Paul preached.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:5-14 Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost, would have all to understand, that the miracle had been wrought by the name, or power, of Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, whom they had crucified; and this confirmed their testimony to his resurrection from the dead, which proved him to be the Messiah. These rulers must either be saved by that Jesus whom they had crucified, or they must perish for ever. The name of Jesus is given to men of every age and nation, as that whereby alone believers are saved from the wrath to come. But when covetousness, pride, or any corrupt passion, rules within, men shut their eyes, and close their hearts, in enmity against the light; considering all as ignorant and unlearned, who desire to know nothing in comparison with Christ crucified. And the followers of Christ should act so that all who converse with them, may take knowledge that they have been with Jesus. That makes them holy, heavenly, spiritual, and cheerful, and raises them above this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their rulers - The rulers of the Jews; doubtless the members of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council of the nation.

The expression their rulers looks as if this book was written for the Gentiles, or Luke would have said our rulers.<p>Elders - Presbyters, or those who were chosen from among the people to sit in the Sanhedrin. It is probable that the rulers were those who held also some other office, but were also authorized to sit in the Great Council.<p>Scribes - See the notes on <a href="/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4</a>.<p>And Annas ... - See the notes on <a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>. It is by no means certain that Annas was at that time the high priest, but he had been, and doubtless retained the title. He was father-in-law to Caiaphas, the high priest; and from this fact, together with his former dignity, he is mentioned first.<p>Caiaphas - Son-in-law of Annas, and now exercising the office of the high priest, <a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>.<p>John, and Alexander ... - Of these persons nothing more is known. It is clear that they were members of the Great Council, and the mention of their names shows that the men of chief authority and influence were assembled to silence the apostles. Annas and Caiaphas had been concerned in the condemnation of Jesus, and they would now feel a special interest in arresting the progress of the gospel among the people. All the success of the gospel reflected back light upon the wicked ness of the act of condemning the Lord Jesus. And this fact may serve, in part, to account for their strong desire to silence the apostles.<p>At Jerusalem - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;  eis. This was the usual place of assembling the Sanhedrin. But the Jewish writers (see Lightfoot on this place) say that 40 years before the destruction of the city, on account of the great increase of crime, etc., the Sanhedrin was removed from place to place. The declaration of Luke that they were now assembled in Jerusalem, seems to imply that they sometimes met in other places. It is probable that the members of the Sanhedrin were not in the city at the time mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/4-3.htm">Acts 4:3</a>, and this was the reason why the trial was deferred to the next day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. their rulers, &c.&#8212;This was a regular meeting of the Sanhedrim (see on [1946]Mt 2:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/acts/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their rulers; </span> the sanhedrim, or great council. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Elders and scribes; </span> the magistrates of the city, scribes, doctors, or teachers of the law, &c.; howsoever these might be distinguished, they are all as one against the doctrine of the gospel, and endeavour to put out the light as soon as it began to shine, as Herod would have killed Christ in the manger. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/acts/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass on the morrow,....
