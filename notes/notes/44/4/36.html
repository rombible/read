It is possible, as Rabbinic writers often give <span class= "ital">Jose</span> for Joseph, that both were but different forms, like Simon and Simeon, of the same name. The later friendship between the Levite of Cyprus and St. Paul makes it probable that there had been some previous companionship (see Notes on <a href="/acts/9-27.htm" title="But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:">Acts 11:25</a>), and it may well have been that he was sent from Cyprus to receive his education in the famous schools of Tarsus, or practised with Saul in early life the craft of tent-making, for which Tarsus was famous, and in which they were afterwards fellow-labourers (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1Corinthians 9:6</a>). As a Levite he had probably taken his place in the ministries of the Temple, and may, therefore, have been among our Lord’s actual hearers. His relation Mary, the mother of John surnamed Marcus, was, we know, living at Jerusalem. (See Note on <a href="/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>.) A tradition, as early as Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. ii.</span> § 116), makes him one of the Seventy, and this agrees with the prophetic character which we have seen reason to think of as attaching to that body. (See. Note on <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.) The new name which the Apostles gave him, literally, if we look to its Hebrew etymology, <span class= "ital">The son of prophecy, </span>or, taking St. Luke’s translation, <span class= "ital">The son of counsel, </span>implies the possession of a special gift of persuasive utterance, in which the Apostles recognised the work of the Spirit. The Paraclete had endowed him with the gift of <span class= "ital">paraclesis, </span>in the sense in which that word included counsel, comfort, admonition, application of divine truth to the spiritual necessities of men. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus G. on St. John’s Gospel.</span>) In <a href="/acts/11-23.htm" title="Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would hold to the Lord.">Acts 11:23</a>, we find him <span class= "ital">exhorting</span> the Gentile converts at Antioch, the verb being that from which <span class= "ital">paraclesis</span> is derived. He was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>conspicuous for the gift of prophecy as that gift is described in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1Corinthians 14:3</a>. The several stages in his life come before us later. An Epistle bearing his name, and recognised as his by Clement of Alexandria and Origen, is still extant, but its authenticity is, to say the least, questionable. It consists mainly of allegorical interpretations of Old Testament narratives. Some critics have assigned the Epistle to the Hebrews to his authorship, as the expounder of St. Paul’s thoughts. It should be noted that a little further on his kinswoman Mary’s house is the chief meeting-place of the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>), and that her son John, surnamed Mark, is mentioned by St. Peter (“Marcus my son,” <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>) in words which make it almost certain that he was converted by that Apostle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/acts/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,...">Acts 4:36-37</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Joses </span>— Among the rest of those primitive converts who so generously contributed of their substance for the relief and subsistence of the poor believers, in these extraordinary circumstances, there was <span class="ital">one Joses, by the apostles surnamed Barnabas, The son of consolation </span>— Not only on account of his so largely assisting the poor with his fortune, but also of those peculiar gifts of the Spirit whereby he was so well qualified both to comfort and exhort. <span class="ital">A Levite </span>— And yet so far from being prejudiced against this new religion, which might seem to oppose his temporal interest, that he gladly devoted himself to its service; <span class="ital">of the country of Cyprus </span>— Where, it seems, he was born and brought up. <span class="ital">Having land, sold it </span>— As he was a Levite, he could not have sold, or alienated, his paternal inheritance; (see <a href="/leviticus/25-34.htm" title="But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.">Leviticus 25:34</a>;) but the land or estate here spoken of, might either have been some legacy, or purchased land, in Judea, to which he might have a title till the next jubilee, or, perhaps, some land in Cyprus. And we may suppose it mentioned, either as the first foreign estate sold, or as of some extraordinary value. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:32-37 The disciples loved one another. This was the blessed fruit of Christ's dying precept to his disciples, and his dying prayer for them. Thus it was then, and it will be so again, when the Spirit shall be poured upon us from on high. The doctrine preached was the resurrection of Christ; a matter of fact, which being duly explained, was a summary of all the duties, privileges, and comforts of Christians. There were evident fruits of Christ's grace in all they said and did. They were dead to this world. This was a great evidence of the grace of God in them. They did not take away others' property, but they were indifferent to it. They did not call it their own; because they had, in affection, forsaken all for Christ, and were expecting to be stripped of all for cleaving to him. No marvel that they were of one heart and soul, when they sat so loose to the wealth of this world. In effect, they had all things common; for there was not any among them who lacked, care was taken for their supply. The money was laid at the apostles' feet. Great care ought to be taken in the distribution of public charity, that it be given to such as have need, such as are not able to procure a maintenance for themselves; those who are reduced to want for well-doing, and for the testimony of a good conscience, ought to be provided for. Here is one in particular mentioned, remarkable for this generous charity; it was Barnabas. As one designed to be a preacher of the gospel, he disentangled himself from the affairs of this life. When such dispositions prevail, and are exercised according to the circumstances of the times, the testimony will have very great power upon others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Joses - Many manuscripts, instead of "Joses," here read "Joseph." The reasons why this individual is selected and specified particularly were, doubtless, because he was a foreigner; because it was a remarkable instance of liberality; and because he subsequently distinguished himself in the work of the ministry. He gave himself, his property, his all, to the service of the Lord Jesus, and went forth to the self-denying labors of the gospel. He is mentioned elsewhere with honor in the New Testament <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-24.htm">Acts 11:24</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>, and usually as the companion of the apostle Paul. The occasion on which he became connected with Paul in the ministry was when he himself was sent forth by the church at Jerusalem to Antioch. There, it seems, he heard of the fame of Paul and went to Tarsus to seek him, and brought him with him to Antioch, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22-26</a>. Before this he had been acquainted with him, and had introduced him to the other apostles at a time when they were afraid of Paul, and unwilling to acknowledge him as an apostle, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26-27</a>. At Antioch, Barnabas was led into dissimulation by Peter in regard to the Gentiles, and was reproved by his friend and companion, Paul, <a href="/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a>. He and Paul continued to travel in fellowship until a dispute arose at Antioch about Mark, and they separated, Paul going with Silas through Syria and Cilicia, and Barnabas, with Mark, sailing for his native place, Cyprus, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/15-35.htm">Acts 15:35-41</a>. See the following places for particulars of his history: <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm">Acts 11:25</a>, <a href="/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-2</a>, <a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="/acts/14-12.htm">Acts 14:12</a>; <a href="/acts/15-12.htm">Acts 15:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>.<p>Who by the apostles was surnamed ... - The practice of giving surnames, as expressive of character, was not uncommon.

It is compounded of two Syriac words, the one meaning "son," and the other "prophecy." The Greek word which is used to interpret this &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  parakle&#772;sis, translated "consolation," means properly exhortation, entreaty, petition, or advocacy. It also means "consolation or solace"; and from this meaning the interpretation has been given to the word "Barnabas," but with evident impropriety. It does not appear that the name was bestowed on account of this, though it is probable that he possessed the qualification for administering comfort or consolation in an eminent degree, but on account of his talent for "speaking," or "exhorting" the people to holiness, and his success in preaching. Compare <a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>.<p>A Levite - One of the descendants of Levi employed in the lower services of the temple. The whole tribe of Levi was set apart to the service of religion. It was divided into priests and Levites. The three sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Of the family of "Kohath" Aaron was descended, who was the first high priest. His oldest son succeeded him, and the remainder of his sons were "priests." All the others of the tribe of Levi were called "Levites," and were employed in the work of the temple, in assisting the priests in performing sacred music, etc., <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-6.htm">Deuteronomy 18:6-8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>.<p>Of the country of Cyprus - Cyprus is the largest island in the Mediterranean; an island extremely fertile, abounding in wine, honey, oil, wool, etc. It is mentioned in <a href="/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>; <a href="/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a>. The island is near to Cicilia, and is not far from the Jewish coast. It is said by Dion Caccius (lib. 68, 69) that the Jews were very numerous in that island - Clark. Barnabas afterward became, with Paul, a distinguished preacher to the Gentiles. It is worthy of remark, that "both" were born in pagan countries, though by descent Jews; and as they were trained in pagan lands, they were better suited for their special work. The case of Barnabas is that of a man who had property when he entered the ministry, and who gave up all for the Lord Jesus. The great mass of ministers, like very many who have been distinguished in other professions, have been taken from among the poor, and from humble ranks in life. But all have not been. Many have been wealthy, and have devoted all to Christ; and in regard to others, it is to be remarked, that a very considerable proportion of them could have gained more "wealth" in some other profession than they do in the ministry. The ministry is a work of self-denial, and none should enter it who are not prepared to devote all to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/acts/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, read "Joseph", and so do Beza's most ancient copy, and two of his manuscripts, and the Alexandrian copy, and others; for "Jose", or "Joses", is only an abbreviation or contraction of "Joseph"; though according to others it is the same with "Josiah": there is one of this name, who was the sort of Alphaeus, and brother to two of the apostles, James and Jude, <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a> and another called "Joses Barsabas"; and it may be to distinguish the one from the other this is called "Joses Barnabas"; for so it follows, <p>who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas: his name before his conversion was "Joses", or "Joseph", or "Josiah"; and afterwards, or at least after he came to be acquainted with the apostles, and to be in their company, they called him "Barnabas", The Arabic and Ethiopic versions read, "who was of the apostles"; and so Barnabas is spoken of as if he was an apostle, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a><p>which is, being interpreted, the son of consolation; or "of exhortation"; from the excellent gift and talent he had at exhorting; see <a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a> and from the use he was of for the comforting of distressed minds; for  "Naba, to prophesy", includes both exhortation and comfort; and he having the gift of prophecy or preaching the Gospel, was called  "Barnabas", a son of comfort, or a comforter, or an exhorter: and so Jerom (r) interprets it, "the son of a prophet". Drusius conjectures that his right name was , "Bar Nachama", and by contraction "Barnama", and with a Greek termination "Barnamas"; which properly signifies, in the Chaldee and Syriac languages, "the son of consolation", as it is here interpreted; and he observes, that the letters "M" and "B" are sometimes used one for an other: thus one and the same man is called "Berodach" and "Merodach", <a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a> and the same river is called "Abana", <a href="/2_kings/5-12.htm">2 Kings 5:12</a> and in the margent "Amana"; but others think he had his name from the same word that Noah had his, and which signifies rest and comfort, as appears from the reason of his name. "This same shall comfort us", &amp;c. And so the name of this man in the Chaldee or Syriac language was  , which may be literally rendered "the son of the fathers' rest", or "comfort". And this man is said to be <p>a Levite; of the tribe of Levi, and of the priestly race: <p>and of the country of Cyprus; or "by birth", or "nation, a Cyprian"; for though he was a Jew, as is clear from his being of the tribe of Levi, and was born of Jewish parents, yet in Cyprus, and so was a native of that place. The Ethiopic version renders it, "of the city of Cyprus"; but Cyprus was not a city, but a country; wherefore the Syriac version renders it, "of the place, or country of Cyprus", as we do: it was an island in the further part of the Mediterranean sea; it had its name from the plant Cyprus, and is now by the Turks called "Kibris". According to Pliny (s), it lay to the east and west of Cilicia, and was opposite Syria, and was formerly the seat of nine kingdoms; its circumference was three hundred and seventy miles, and had been called by various names; as Acamantis, Cerastis, Aspella, Amathusia, Macaria, Crypton, and Colinia; in it were fifteen towns or cities, which wcre Paphos, Palsepaphos, Curias, Citium, Corineum, Salamis, Amethus, Lapethos, Solce, Tamaseus, Epidarum, Chytri, Arsinoe, Carpasium, and Golgi. According to the same writer (t), it was by an earthquake divided from Syria; and that part of it which lay to the east from Syria, is said to be less than a hundred miles distant from it. And according to Mela (u), its chief cities were Salamis and Paphos, mentioned in <a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>. And according to Ptolomy (w), it had on the west Pamphylia, on the south the Egyptian and Syrian seas, and on the east the Syrian sea, and on the north the straits of Cilicia: it was inhabited by people of various nations, and, among the rest, by Jews; and R.

Possibly it may not have been bestowed until later, and reference may here be made to it simply to identify him (Nösgen).—<span class="greekheb">βαρνάβας</span>: most commonly derived from <span class="greekheb">בַּר נְבוּאָה</span> (“quod neque ad sensum neque ad litteras prorsus convenit,” Blass) = properly <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς προφητείας</span>. But St. Luke, it is argued, renders this <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς παρακλήσεως</span>, because under the threefold uses of prophecy, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>, the special gift of <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> distinguished Barnabas, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/11-23.htm" title="Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would hold to the Lord.">Acts 11:23</a>. So Harnack (whose full article “Barnabas” should be consulted, <span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie für prot. Theol. und Kirche</span>,” xv., 410) explains it as indicating a <span class="ital">prophet</span> in the sense in which the word was used in the early Church, <a href="/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a> (<a href="/acts/11-23.htm" title="Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would hold to the Lord.">Acts 11:23</a>), <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> = edifying exhortation. But not only is <span class="greekheb">בַּר</span> an Aramaic word, whilst <span class="greekheb">נבואה</span> is Hebrew, but the above solution of St. Luke’s translation is by no means satisfactory (see Zöckler, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). In <a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1 Corinthians 14:3</a> <span class="greekheb">παράκ</span>. might equally mean consolation, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;...">2 Corinthians 1:3-7</a>, and it is translated “comfort” (not “exhortation”) in the R.V. In St. Luke’s Gospel the word is used twice, <a href="/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>, <a href="/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.">Luke 6:24</a>, and in both passages it means comfort, consolation, <span class="ital">cf.</span> the cognate verb in <a href="/acts/16-25.htm" title="And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.">Acts 16:25</a>. Another derivation has been suggested by Klostermann, <span class="ital">Probleme im Aposteltexte</span>, pp. 8–14. He maintains that both parts of the word are Aramaic, <span class="greekheb">בר</span> and <span class="greekheb">נְוָחָא</span>, <span class="ital">solatium</span>, and that therefore St. Luke’s translation is quite justified. Blass however points out that as in the former derivation so here there is a difficulty in the connection between <span class="greekheb">βαρνάβας</span> and the somewhat obscure Aramaic word. In the conversion of Barnabas, the first man whose heart was so touched as to join him, in spite of his Levitical status and culture, to ignorant and unlettered men, the Apostles might well see a source of hope and comfort (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/genesis/5-29.htm" title="And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed.">Genesis 5:29</a>), Klostermann, p. 13. It is also worthy of note that the LXX frequently uses <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> as a translation of the common Hebrew words for comfort or consolation; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/job/21-2.htm" title="Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.">Job 21:2</a>, Ps. 93:19, <a href="/isaiah/57-8.htm" title="Behind the doors also and the posts have you set up your remembrance: for you have discovered yourself to another than me, and are gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you a covenant with them; you loved their bed where you saw it.">Isaiah 57:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/16-17.htm" title="For my eyes are on all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from my eyes.">Jeremiah 16:17</a>, etc., and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="ital">Psalms of Solomon</span> 13, title, <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις τῶν δικαίων</span>. On the whole question, Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, p. 175 ff., should be consulted. Deissmann, referring to an inscription recently discovered in Northern Syria, in the old Nicopolis, probably of the third or fourth century A.D., explains the word as follows: The inscription contains the name <span class="greekheb">βαρνεβοῦν</span>, which . considers rightly = Son of Nebo; <span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, Symmachus, <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a>, who renders <span class="greekheb">נְבוֹ</span>, <span class="ital">Nebo</span> (transcribed by the LXX, Aquila and Theodotion, <span class="greekheb">Ναβώ</span>), by <span class="greekheb">Νεβοῦς</span>. The view of the connection or identity of <span class="greekheb">βαρνάβας</span> with <span class="greekheb">βαρνεβοῦς</span> is facilitated by the fact that in other words the <span class="greekheb">ε</span> sound in Nebo is replaced by [167]; <span class="ital">cf. Ne</span>buchadnezar = LXX <span class="greekheb">Ναβουχοδονοσορ</span>, so <span class="ital">Ne</span>buzaradan = LXX <span class="greekheb">Ναβουζαρδαν</span>. Very probably therefore <span class="greekheb">βαρναβοῦς</span> will occur instead of <span class="greekheb">βαρνεβοῦς</span>—and the Jews themselves might easily have converted <span class="greekheb">βαρναβοῦς</span> into <span class="greekheb">βαρναβᾶς</span>—<span class="greekheb">ας</span> being the constant termination of Greek names. In his <span class="ital">Neue Bibelstudien</span>, p. 16, Deissmann is able to refer to an Aramaic inscription from Palmyra, dating 114 A.D., with the word Barnebo, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <span class="ital">Enc.

It would also seem that after the Captivity the distribution of land, according to the Mosaic Law, was no longer strictly observed (Overbeck, Hackett (Hastings’ B.D.), “Barnabas,” <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Josephus, a Levite and Priest, has lands in the vicinity of Jerusalem, and gains others in exchange for them from Vespasian, <span class="ital">Vita</span>, 76.—<span class="greekheb">Κύπριος τῷ γένει</span>: soon after the time of Alexander, and possibly before it, Jews had settled in Cyprus, and <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/15-23.htm" title="And to all the countries and to Sampsames, and the Lacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and Rhodus, and Aradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.">1Ma 15:23</a> indicates that they were there in good numbers.
