The brethren of the priests are the Levites, as being their fellow-tribesmen and assistants. Two-and-twenty names of such heads are enumerated, and these reappear, with but slight variations attributable to clerical errors, as names of priestly houses in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a>, where they are given in conjunction with the names of those priests who, in the days of Joiakim, either represented these houses, or occupied as heads the first position in them.

Hence the present chapter appears to be the most appropriate place for comparing with each other the several statements given in the books of Nehemiah and Ezra, concerning the divisions or orders of priests in the period immediately following the return from the captivity, and for discussing the question how the heads and houses of priests enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a> and 12 stand related on the one hand to the list of the priestly races who returned with Zerubbabel and Joshua, and on the other to the twenty-four orders of priests instituted by David.

This conjecture would be conceivable, if we found in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a> that only thirteen orders or heads of priests had signed instead of twenty-two. Since, however, instead of the seven missing names, six others signed the covenant, this cannot be the reason for the difference between the names in the two documents (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a>, 12), which is probably to be found in the time that elapsed between the making of these lists.

These the prophets of the returned captives again divided into twenty-four; whereupon their names were written upon tickets and put in an urn, from which Jedaiah drew five, and each of the other three before-named divisions as many: it was then ordained by those prophets, that even if the division Joiarib (probably the first division before the captivity) should return, Jedaiah should nevertheless retain his position, and Joiarib should be &#1496;&#1508;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; (associated with him, belonging to him)."

Bertheau on Neh. p. 230, and Oehler in Herzog's Realencycl. xii. p. 185, who, though refusing this tradition the value of independent historical testimony, still give it more weight than it deserves.)<p>is, that the four divisions given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7.htm">Nehemiah 7</a>, "the sons of Jedaiah, the sons of Immer, the sons of Pashur and Harim," were the priests of the four (Davidic) orders of Jedaiah, Immer, Malchijah, and Harim (the second, sixteenth, fifth, and third orders of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>). For the sake of restoring, according to the ancient institution, a greater number of priestly orders, the twenty-two orders enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12.htm">Nehemiah 12</a> were formed from these four divisions; and the full number of twenty-four was not immediately completed, only because, according to <a href="/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/7-63.htm">Nehemiah 7:63</a>., three families of priests who could not find their registers returned, as well as those before named, and room was therefore left for their insertion in the twenty-four orders: the first of these three families, viz., Habaiah, being probably identical with the eighth class, Abia; the second, Hakkoz, with the seventh class of the same name. See Oehler's before-cited work. p. 184f. But this view is decidedly erroneous, and the error lies in the identification of the four races of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>, on account of the similarity of the names Jedaiah, Immer, and Harim, with those of the second, sixteenth, and third classes of the Davidic division, - thus regarding priestly races as Davidic priestly classes, through mere similarity of name, without reflecting that even the number 4487, given in <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>., is incompatible with this assumption. For if these four races were only four orders of priests, each order must have numbered about 1120 males, and the twenty-four orders of the priesthood before the captivity would have yielded the colossal sum of from 24,000 to 26,000 priests. It is true that we have no statement of the numbers of the priesthood; but if the numbering of the Levites in David's times gave the amount of 38,000 males, the priests of that time could at the most have been 3800, and each of the twenty-four orders would have included in all 150 persons, or at most seventy-five priests of the proper age for officiating. Now, if this number had doubled in the interval of time extending to the close of the captivity, the 4487 who returned with Zerubbabel would have formed more than half of the whole number of priests then living, and not merely the amount of four classes. Hence we cannot but regard Jedaiah, Immer, Pashur, and Harim, of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>, as names not of priestly orders, but of great priestly races, and explain the occurrence of three of these names as those of certain of the orders of priests formed by David, by the consideration, that the Davidic orders were names after heads of priestly families of the days of David, and that several of these heads, according to the custom of bestowing upon sons, grandsons, etc., the names of renowned ancestors, bore the names of the founders and heads of the greater races and houses. The classification of the priests in <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>. is genealogical, i.e., it follows not the division into orders made by David for the service of the temple, but the genealogical ramification into races and houses. The sons of Jedaiah, Immer, etc., are not the priests belonging to the official orders of Jedaiah, Immer, etc., but the priestly races descended from Jedaiah, etc. The four races (mentioned <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>, etc.), each of which averaged upwards of 1000 men, were, as appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12</a>, divided into twenty-two houses. From this number of houses, it was easy to restore the old division into twenty-four official orders. That it was not, however, considered necessary to make this artificial restoration of the twenty-four classes immediately, is seen from the circumstances that both under Joiakim, i.e., a generation after Zerubbabel's return (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a>), only twenty-two houses are enumerated, and under Nehemiah, i.e., after Ezra's return (in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a>), only twenty-one heads of priestly houses sealed the document. Whether, and how the full number of twenty-four was completed, cannot, for want of information, be determined. The statement of Joseph. Ant. vii. 14. 7, that David's division into orders continues to this day, affords no sufficient testimony to the fact.<p>According, then, to what has been said, the difference between the names in the two lists of <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a> and 12 is to be explained simply by the fact, that the names of those who sealed the covenant, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a>, are names neither of orders nor houses, but of heads of houses living in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. Of these names, a portion coincides indeed with the names of the orders and houses, while the rest are different. The coincidence or sameness of the names does not, however, prove that the individuals belonged to the house whose name they bore. On the contrary, it appears from <a href="/nehemiah/12-13.htm">Nehemiah 12:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-16.htm">Nehemiah 12:16</a>, that of two Meshullams, one was the head of the house of Ezra, the other of the house of Ginnethon; and hence, in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a>, Amariah may have belonged to the house of Malluch, Hattush to the house of Shebaniah, Malluch to the house of Meremoth, etc. In this manner, both the variation and coincidence of the names in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a> and 12 may be easily explained; the only remaining difficulty being, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10.htm">Nehemiah 10</a> only twenty-one, not twenty-two, heads of houses are said to have sealed. This discrepancy seems, indeed, to have arisen from the omission of a name in transcription. For the other possible explanation, viz., that in the interval between Joiakim and Nehemiah, the contemporary of Eliashib, one house had died out, is very far-fetched.</body></html>
