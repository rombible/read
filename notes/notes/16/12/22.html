For Nehemiah, to be able to speak of Darius, must have lived, according to Huet, at least one hundred and thirty-one years, and at that age have written or enlarged his book, which is not probable. We may therefore conclude, that the book of Nehemiah could not have been published, such as it is, till the reign of Darius Codomanus at least; and since one chapter of the book of Nehemiah has been put into that of Ezra, we may very probably suppose that it did not appear in its present form till about the same time. So that these two books have been collected from the memoirs of three different authors, to which have been added several things for the illustration of the history.” Le Clerc, and Houbigant’s note on the place.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-26 It is a debt we owe to faithful ministers, to remember our guides, who have spoken to us the word of God.

Codomannus (336–331) is the most obvious explanation. And if the Jaddua mentioned in this verse be, as there is really no reason to doubt, the high-priest of Alexander’s time, the mention of Darius III. Codomannus, the contemporary Persian king, presents no difficulty. On the title ‘the Persian,’ see the Introduction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The alternative preferred by some commentators, viz. that Darius Nothus (424–404 b.c.), the successor of Artaxerxes, is intended, is improbable after the mention of Jaddua’s enrolment, unless it be maintained that this Jaddua is not the high-priest of Alexander’s time. But it must also be evident that the reference to Jaddua is to his tenure of the high-priesthood. The attempt to reconcile the mention of Jaddua with the allusion to Darius Nothus, by the suggestion that Darius Nothus was king when Jaddua was born, only arises from the presupposition that none but Nehemiah could have written this chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua</span>.

But this is unlikely, since there was nothing to recall that unimportant personage to the thoughts of the writer.
