It would seem that as these six declined to seal to Nehemiah's covenant, they were placed below the rest here in a sort of supplementary list.

The introduction of the conjunction "and" here, and here only, in this list separates off very markedly the last six names from the first sixteen. A similar division is made in ver. 19. The reason for the division seems to be that these last six courses, though including some of the very highest priestly families, as those of Joiarib and Jedaiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-39.htm">Nehemiah 7:39</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-10.htm">Nehemiah 11:10</a>), for some reason or other, did not seal to the covenant, whereas the other sixteen courses did so. <span class="cmt_word">Jedaiah</span>.
