Eight names are identical with those of the heads in David's time. On comparing the present list with that of the families who sealed to Nehemiah's covenant <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-2.htm">Nehemiah 10:2-8</a>, we shall find that the first sixteen recur in that document nearly in the same order; but that the last six are absent from it. It would seem that as these six declined to seal to Nehemiah's covenant, they were placed below the rest here in a sort of supplementary list. Note especially the "and" which connects the second part of the lists with the earlier part, both in <a href="/nehemiah/12-6.htm">Nehemiah 12:6</a> and in <a href="/nehemiah/12-19.htm">Nehemiah 12:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Ne 12:1-9. Priests and Levites Who Came Up with Zerubbabel.<p>1. these are the priests&#8212;according to Ne 12:7, "the chief of the priests," the heads of the twenty-four courses into which the priesthood was divided (1Ch 24:1-20). Only four of the courses returned from the captivity (Ne 7:39-42; Ezr 2:36-39). But these were divided by Zerubbabel, or Jeshua, into the original number of twenty-four. Twenty-two only are enumerated here, and no more than twenty in Ne 12:12-21. The discrepancy is due to the extremely probable circumstance that two of the twenty-four courses had become extinct in Babylon; for none belonging to them are reported as having returned (Ne 12:2-5). Hattush and Maadiah may be omitted in the account of those persons' families (Ne 12:12), for these had no sons.<p>Shealtiel&#8212;or Salathiel.<p>Ezra&#8212;This was most likely a different person from the pious and patriotic leader. If he were the same person, he would now have reached a very patriarchal age&#8212;and this longevity would doubtless be due to his eminent piety and temperance, which are greatly conducive to the prolongation of life, but, above all, to the special blessing of God, who had preserved and strengthened him for the accomplishment of the important work he was called upon to undertake in that critical period of the Church's history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,....

Michmash (&#1502;&#1499;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; or &#1502;&#1499;&#1502;&#1505;), now Mukhmas, sixty-three minutes north-east of Geba, and three and a half leagues north of Jerusalem; see rem. on <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>.

We therefore abide by the view advocated by Krafft and Strauss, that the ruins of Medinet Chai or Gai, east of Geba, point out the situation of the ancient Ai or Ajja; see rem. on <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>. Bethel is the present Beitin; see on <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>. The position of Nob is not as yet certainly ascertained, important objections existing to its identification with the village el-Isawije, between Anta and Jerusalem; comp. Valentiner (in the Zeitschrift d. deutsch. morgld. Gesellsch. xii. p. 169), who, on grounds worthy of consideration, transposes Nob to the northern heights before Jerusalem, the road from which leads into the valley of Kidron. Ananiah (&#1506;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;), a place named only here, is conjectured by Van de Velde (after R. Schwartz), Mem. p. 284, to be the present Beit Hanina (Arab. hn&#305;&#770;na&#770;), east of Nebi Samwil; against which conjecture even the exchange of &#1506; and &#1495; raises objections; comp. Tobler, Topographie, ii. p. 414. Hazor of Benjamin, supposed by Robinson (Palestine) to be Tell 'Assur, north of Tayibeh, is much more probably found by Tobler, Topographie, ii. p. 400, in Khirbet Arsr, perhaps Assur, Arab. &#8219;s&#803;u&#770;r, eight minutes eastward of Bir Nebla (between Rama and Gibeon); comp. Van de Velde, Mem. p. 319. Ramah, now er Rm, two leagues north of Jerusalem; see rem. on <a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>. Githaim, whither the Beerothites fled, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-3.htm">2 Samuel 4:3</a>, is not yet discovered. Tobler (dritte Wand. p. 175) considers it very rash to identify it with the village Katanneh in Wady Mansur. Hadid, &#x391;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;, see rem. on <a href="/ezra/2-33.htm">Ezra 2:33</a>. Zeboim, in a valley of the same name (<a href="/1_samuel/13-18.htm">1 Samuel 13:18</a>), is not yet discovered. Neballat, mentioned only here, is preserved in Beith Nebala, about two leagues north-east of Ludd (Lydda); comp. Rob. Palestine, and Van de Velde, Mem. p. 336. With respect to Lod and Ono, see rem. on <a href="/1_chronicles/8-12.htm">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>; and on the valley of craftsmen, comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/4-14.htm">1 Chronicles 4:14</a>. The omission of Jericho, Gibeon, and Mizpah is the more remarkable, inasmuch as inhabitants of these towns are mentioned as taking part in the building of the wall (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-2.htm">Nehemiah 3:2</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/3-7.htm">Nehemiah 3:7</a>).</body></html>
