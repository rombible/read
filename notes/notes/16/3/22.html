No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word here translated "plain" is applied in the rest of Scripture almost exclusively to the Ghor or Jordan valley.

From <a href="/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16</a> onwards we find for the most part &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, after him, instead of &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500;, which only occurs again in <a href="/nehemiah/3-17.htm">Nehemiah 3:17</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a>. Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur (see rem. on <a href="/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>), repaired the wall as far as "opposite the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and to the house of the heroes." The sepulchres of David are the sepulchres of the house of David in the city of David (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>). "Opposite the sepulchres of David" is the length of wall on the eastern side of Zion, where was probably, as Thenius endeavours to show in the Zeitschr. of the deutsch morgenl. Gesellsch. xxi. p. 495f., an entrance to the burying-place of the house of David, which was within the city. The "pool that was made" must be sought at no great distance, in the Tyropoean valley, but has not yet been discovered. The view of Krafft (Topographie von Jerusalem, p. 152), that it was the reservoir artificially constructed by Hezekiah, between the two walls for the water of the old pool (<a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>), rests upon incorrect combinations. "The house of the heroes" is also unknown. In <a href="/nehemiah/3-17.htm">Nehemiah 3:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-18.htm">Nehemiah 3:18</a>, the lengths of wall repaired by the three building parties there mentioned are not stated. "The Levites, Rehum the son of Bani," stands for: the Levites under Rehum the son of Bani. There was a Rehum among those who returned with Zerubbabel, <a href="/nehemiah/12-3.htm">Nehemiah 12:3</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>; and a Bani occurs among the Levites in <a href="/nehemiah/9-5.htm">Nehemiah 9:5</a>. After him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district. Keilah, situate, according to <a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1</a>, in the hill region, is probably the village of Kila, discovered by Tobler (vol. iii. p. 151), eastward of Beit Dshibrin. By the addition &#1500;&#1508;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;, for his district, i.e., that half of the whole district which was under his rule, "it is expressly stated that the two halves of the district of Keilah worked apart one from the other" (Bertheau). The other half is mentioned in the verse next following. </body></html>
