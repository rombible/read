No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zanoah lay west of Jerusalem, at the distance of about 10 miles (<a href="/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the inhabitants of Zanoah&#8212;There were two towns so called in the territory of Judah (Jos 15:34, 56).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The valley gate repaired Hanun,....

This very reason, however, would enable us to accept the repairing of ‘the thousand cubits’ as the work of ‘Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah.’ Comparatively little work was here needed, and a small party could undertake a long stretch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘dung gate’ was probably at the S.W. angle of the wall. The wall having passed due S. from the ‘valley gate’ to the ‘dung gate,’ turned thence in an easterly direction.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The valley gate</span>. A gate in the western wall (See the comment on Nehemiah 2:13.) <span class="cmt_word">Zanoah</span> was situated to the west of Jerusalem at the distance of some nine or ten miles. It is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a> as a city of Judah, but was not a place of much importance. We can scarcely suppose that the inhabitants had as much as <span class="cmt_word">a thousand cubits</span> of the wall assigned to them, since that is more than a quarter of a mile, and the entire circuit was under four miles. Bertheau suggests that Nehemiah merely means to note that the distance between the two gates, the Valley and the Dung gate, was a thousand cubits, and that he says nothing of the repairs because no repairs were needed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah. If Melatiah is to be regarded as the superintendent of the men of Gibeon, Jadon the Meronothite must be equally esteemed that of the men of Mizpah. Meronoth, mentioned only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-30.htm">1 Chronicles 27:30</a>, must have been some small place near Mizpah. Mizpah (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, the watch-tower) is probably the modern Nebi Samwil, two leagues to the north-east of Jerusalem; see rem. on <a href="/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>. The meaning of the words next following, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, is questionable. Bertheau, together with Osiander, Cler., de Wette, and others, understands them as more precisely defining the men before named, as men of Gibeon and Mizpah, of the throne or belonging to the throne of the Pechah of Eber hannahar. This addition brings to light the fact that Jews who were not under the jurisdiction of Nehemiah, nevertheless took part in the restoration of the wall. It also distinguishes these men of Mizpah from those mentioned <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a>, who were certainly not under the Pechah of Eber hannahar. Finally, the boundary of the little territory of the returned Jewish community must have been at about Mizpah and Gibeon; and a statement that certain inhabitants of this district were not under the Pechah of Jerusalem, but under the Pechah of the province west of Euphrates, would agree with the position of Gibeon and Mizpah. None, however, of these reasons are of much force. For if, according to <a href="/nehemiah/3-5.htm">Nehemiah 3:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a>, the Tekoites repaired two different lengths of wall, without this fact implying any distinction between these two parties of Tekoite builders, the same may be the case with the men of Gibeon and Mizpah. Besides, neither in this verse nor in <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a> are the men of Mizpah in general spoken of, so as to make a distinction necessary; for in this verse two chiefs, Melatiah and Jadon, are designated as men of Gibeon and Mizpah, and in <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a> two rulers of the district of Mizpah are specified by name. Hence the view that part of the inhabitants of Mizpah were under the jurisdiction of the Pechah of the province west of Euphrates, and part under that of the Pechah of Jerusalem, is devoid of probability. Finally, there is no adequate analogy for the metonomy set up in support of this view, viz., that &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488;, a seat, a throne, stands for jurisdiction. The words in question can have only a local signification. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; may indeed by metonomy be used for the official residence, but not for the official or judicial district, or jurisdiction of the Pechah. &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1488; does not state the point to which, but the direction or locality in which, these persons repaired the wall: "towards the seat of the Pechah," i.e., at the place where the court or tribunal of the governor placed over the province on this side Euphrates was held when he came to Jerusalem to administer justice, or to perform any other official duties required of him. This being so, it appears from this verse that this court was within the northern wall, and undoubtedly near a gate.</body></html>
