No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "king's high house" is almost certainly the old palace of David, which was on the temple hill, and probably occupied a position directly north of the temple.<p>That was by the court of the prison - Prisons were in old times adjuncts of palaces.

In the present passage we have <span class="ital">either</span> ‘the king’s upper house,’ so called to distinguish it from the king’s house, in which was the court of the guard; <span class="ital">or</span>, as seems more probable, seeing that the passage is a description of the city wall, ‘the upper tower,’ which is identified as the one projecting from the king’s palace and close to the ‘court of the guard.’ In the vicinity of the royal palace and Temple there would probably be several towers. The LXX. <span class="greekheb">ὁ πύργος</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀνώτερος</span> accepted the latter explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is very probable that the base of ‘the tower’ here spoken of was reached by Sir Charles Warren. ‘A great wall still exists, though buried in rubbish, joining the Haram wall at the south-east angle. It was evidently built for purposes of fortification, for it is fourteen feet thick.… There are several towers projecting from the wall, one of which is very remarkable, as it projects more than any of the rest, standing upon scarped rock, and having another wall leading from it going down towards the Kedron.’ (Harper, <span class="ital">The Bible and Modern Discoveries</span>, P. 509.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘the upper house of the king’.

In the original it is uncertain whether the word translated "high" belongs to "tower" or "house." Most commentators attach it to "tower." The "king's house" of this place can be nothing but the old palace of David, which was in this quarter, while Solomon's was on the opposite, or western, hill This palace, like Solomon s (<a href="/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>), would naturally have its <span class="cmt_word">prison</span>, which would stand in its own <span class="cmt_word">court</span>. From this prison, the "prison gate" of <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a> took its name. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Next to these repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece (on &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, see rem. on <a href="/nehemiah/3-11.htm">Nehemiah 3:11</a>) opposite the ascent to the armoury of the angle. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; or &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; (in most editions) is probably an abbreviation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, arsenal, armoury; and &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1510;&#1493;&#1506; is, notwithstanding the article in &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, genitive; for to combine it as an accusative with &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1468;, and read, "the going up of the armoury upon the angle," gives no suitable meaning. The locality itself cannot indeed be more precisely stated. The armoury was probably situate on the east side of Zion, at a place where the wall of the city formed an angle; or it occupied an angle within the city itself, no other buildings adjoining it on the south. The opinion of Bertheau, that the armoury stood where the tower described by Tobler (Dritte Wand. p. 228) stands, viz., about midway between the modern Zion gate and the dung-gate, and of which he says that "its lower strata of stones are undoubtedly of a remoter date than the rebuilding of the wall in the sixteenth century," coincides with the assumption already refuted, that the old wall of the city of David passed, like the southern wall of modern Jerusalem, over Mount Zion. </body></html>
