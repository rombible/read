No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The foundations of an outlying tower near the southeast angle of the temple area in this position have been recently discovered.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. the Nethinims&#8212;Not only the priests and the Levites, but the common persons that belonged to the house of God, contributed to the work. The names of those who repaired the walls of Jerusalem are commemorated because it was a work of piety and patriotism to repair the holy city.

Bertheau objects to the reading &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, and conjectures that it should be &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, "up the hill." But the reason he adduces, viz., that often as the word &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511; occurs in this description, a further definition is nowhere else added to it, speaks as much against, as for his proposed alteration; definitions of locality never, throughout the entire narrative, preceding &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, but uniformly standing after it, as also in the present verse. Certainly &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492; cannot here mean either to be angry, or to be incensed, but may without difficulty be taken, in the sense of the Tiphal &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, to emulate, to contend (<a href="/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>), and the perfect adverbially subordinated to the following verb (comp.
