No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The gate Miphkad - Not elsewhere mentioned.

But the needs and equipment of the Temple services and of those who took part in them were sufficiently varied to account for this combination. We should think of an Oriental bazaar rather than of a modern house. The open spaces near the Temple would be thronged with money-changers and sellers of animals for sacrifice and of articles for offerings. On the later abuse of this custom cf. <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>; <a href="/john/2-14.htm" title="And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:">John 2:14</a>. Some who have found a difficulty in this combination disregard the tradition of the accents, and divide the verse differently, stopping at ‘Nethinim,’ and making a new clause of which ‘the merchants’ are the subject, i.e. ‘and the merchants repaired, &c.’ We should however certainly expect the phrase ‘after him’ at the beginning of such a clause.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">over against the gate Miphkad</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">over against the gate of Hammiphkad.</span> The word ‘Miphkad’ occurs in <a href="/ezekiel/43-21.htm" title="You shall take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.">Ezekiel 43:21</a>, ‘Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place (<span class="ital">miphkad</span>) of the house, without the sanctuary.’ It has hence been often supposed to be the gate through which the bullock of the sin offering was led ‘without the sanctuary.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words ‘over against’ seem to imply that the gate of Hammiphkad was not on but opposite the city wall.

We join &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, though it is also verbally admissible to combine it with &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, "the tower which stands out from the king's upper house," because nothing is known of an upper and lower king's house. It would be more natural to assume (with Bertheau) that there was an upper and a lower tower at the court of the prison, but this is not implied by &#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;. The word means first, high, elevated, and its use does not assume the existence of a lower tower; while the circumstance that the same tower is in <a href="/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a> called the great (&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;) tells in favour of the meaning high in the present case. The court of the prison was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>, in or near the king's house; it is also mentioned <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-8.htm">Jeremiah 32:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/37-21.htm">Jeremiah 37:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-13.htm">Jeremiah 38:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-28.htm">Jeremiah 38:28</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>. But from none of these passages can it be inferred, as by Bertheau, that it was situate in the neighbourhood of the temple. His further remark, too, that the king's house is not the royal palace in the city of David, but an official edifice standing upon or near the temple area, and including the court of the prison with its towers, is entirely without foundation.<p>(Note: Equally devoid of proof is the view of Ewald, Diestel (in Herzog's Realencycl. xiii. p. 325), Arnold, and others, that the royal palace stood upon Moriah or Ophel on the south side of the temple, in support of which Diestel adduces <a href="/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>. See the refutation of this view in the commentary on <a href="/1_kings/7-12.htm">1 Kings 7:12</a> (Note).)<p>The royal palace lay, according to Josephus, Ant. viii. 5. 2, opposite the temple (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;), i.e., on the north-eastern side of Zion, and this is quite in accordance with the statements of this verse; for as it is not till <a href="/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a> that the description of the wall-building reaches the walls of Ophel, all the localities and buildings spoken of in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-24.htm">Nehemiah 3:24-27</a> must be sought for on the east side of Zion. The court of the prison formed, according to Eastern custom, part of the royal fortress upon Zion. The citadel had, moreover, a high tower. This is obvious from Sol 4:4, though the tower of David there mentioned, on which hung a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men, may not be identical with the tower of the king's house in this passage; from <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a>, where the tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, is the tower of the royal citadel; and from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, where citadel and tower (&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;, properly watch-tower) answer to the &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; of the royal citadel, which lay with its forts upon the hill of Zion. This high tower of the king's house, i.e., of the royal citadel, stood, according to our verses, in the immediate neighbourhood of the angle and the corner (&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;); for the section of wall which reached to the &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; lay opposite the angle and the high tower of the king's house. The wall here evidently formed a corner, running no longer from south to north, but turning eastwards, and passing over Ophel, the southern spur of Moriah. A length from this corner onwards was built by Pedaiah the son of Parosh; comp. <a href="/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3</a>. </body></html>
