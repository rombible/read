No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ.

This distribution, by which the building was carried on in all parts simultaneously with great energy, was eminently favorable to despatch. "The villages where the restorers resided being mostly mentioned, it will be seen that this circumstance affords a general indication of the part of the wall upon which they labored, such places being on that side of the city nearest their place of abode; the only apparent exception being, perhaps, where they repaired more than their piece. Having completed their first undertaking (if they worked any more), there being no more work to be done on the side next their residence, or having arrived after the repairs on that part of the city nearest them under operation were completed, they would go wherever their services would be required" [Barclay, City of the Great King].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Did not submit to it, would not further it, either through pride, or sloth and carelessness, or covetousness, or secret compliance with the enemies of the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the work of their Lord; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The absence of the name of Tekoa from the list of towns in Ezra 2. is remarkable. Perhaps the Jews in Zerubbabel’s time could not extend so far south. Here the mention of the Tekoites implies that the town was now occupied by Jews, or that old dwellers in Tekoa still formed a distinct community (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/3-2.htm" title="And next to him built the men of Jericho. And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri.">Nehemiah 3:2</a>) in Jerusalem.

There are here three alternative renderings. (1) A.V. ‘of their Lord.’ The somewhat unusual phrase ‘the work of their Lord’ (Adonai) instead of ‘the work of the Lord (Jehovah),’ or ‘the work of their God,’ has been defended on the ground that it carries out the metaphor of the clause. This is the traditional Jewish interpretation. But the word is not common in these books as a Divine name (see note on <a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.">Nehemiah 1:11</a>), and the use of the pronoun ‘their’ makes the interpretation improbable (Vulg. <span class="ital">in opere Domini sui</span>). The use of this title for God in plain narrative is most improbable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) R.V. marg. ‘their lords,’ namely, the leaders of the Jews; but this would not be at all a suitable word to describe the relation of the ‘nobles’ of a town to the ‘rulers’ of Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) ‘their lord.’ This rendering of the R.V. seems the most natural, and is best understood to mean a reference to Nehemiah himself (cf. <a href="/ezra/10-3.htm" title="Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.">Ezra 10:3</a>). He was ‘the lord’ of the Jews, appointed by the king, and ‘the nobles’ of the Jewish towns as well as of Jerusalem owed him service and assistance in his great work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The hostility of Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem to Nehemiah would make itself felt on the towns upon the borders of the neighbouring races. The nobles of ‘Tekoa,’ which lay on the outskirts of the wilderness, may very possibly have sympathised with the Arabian chiefs represented by Geshem, or have had intimate relations with the outlying peoples.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Tekoites</span> are the people of Tekoah, whence came the "wise woman" whom Joab sent to incline David to fetch home Absalom (<a href="/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2, 3</a>). It was a small place, and does not appear, either in the catalogue of those who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="/ezra/2-20.htm">Ezra 2:20-35</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25-38</a>), or in the census list of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25-35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their nobles put not their necks to the work</span>. This imputation of blame has been thought out of harmony with the general narrative contained in the chapter, and various emendations have been proposed to remove the so-called difficulty. But it has really first to be shown that a difficulty exists. Surely it would have been more strange if there had been no opposition to Nehemiah's wishes - no withdrawal from the work, than if there were the amount of opposition that is recorded. And supposing opposition to be made, why should Nehemiah not notice it? In music, the force and value of harmonious notes is brought out by an occasional discord. A desire to do honour to those who deserved it would be quite compatible with a determination to brand with disgrace the undeserving. And the contrast would enhance the value of the praise. Thus, there is no reason for disturbing the existing text, nor for questioning its plain meaning. The upper classes at Tekoah, the <span class="accented">adirim</span> or "exalted, withdrew from the work, like oxen withdrawing their necks from the yoke, and stood aloof, leaving it to the common people to engage in it, or not, as they pleased. The common people were perhaps moved to the greater zeal by the defection of their natural leaders. They were among those who accomplished a double task, repairing a second portion of the wall (ver. 27) after having finished their first. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the adversaries of the Jews heard this, they derided their resolution.

The irony lies in the fact that they did not give the Jews credit for power to build fortifications, so as to be able to rebel.
