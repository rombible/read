No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the throne ... - The meaning is thought to be "the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who, though they worked for Nehemiah, were not under his government, but belonged to the jurisdiction of the governor on this side the river." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall&#8212;or, "double wall," extending from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits in length, formerly broken down by Joash, king of Israel [2Ch 25:23], but afterwards rebuilt by Uzziah [2Ch 26:9], who made it so strong that the Chaldeans, finding it difficult to demolish, had left it standing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Over against his house; </span> that part of the wall which was next to him, which his own interest obliged him to do with care. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And next unto him repaired Jedaiah, the son of Harumaph, over against his house,....

Meremoth ben Urijah repaired, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-21.htm">Nehemiah 3:21</a>, another portion besides. Meshullam ben Berechiah was, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-18.htm">Nehemiah 6:18</a>, a person of consideration in Jerusalem. The men of Tekoa, who do not occur among those who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>), also repaired a second portion. "But their nobles brought not their neck to the service of their Lord." The expression "to bring the neck to service" is, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11</a>, to be understood as meaning: to bring the neck under the yoke of any one, i.e., to subject oneself to the service of another. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; stands for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501;. It is questionable whether &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is to be taken as the plural of excellence, and understood of God, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-3.htm">Psalm 135:3</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>; or of earthly lords or rulers, as in <a href="/genesis/40-1.htm">Genesis 40:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-27.htm">1 Kings 12:27</a>. The former view seems to us decidedly correct, for it cannot be discerned how the suffix should (according to Bertheau's opinion) prevent our thinking of the service of God, if the repairing of the wall of Jerusalem may be regarded as a service required by God and rendered to Him. Besides, the fact that &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is only used of kings, and is inapplicable whether to the authorities in Jerusalem or to Nehemiah, speaks against referring it to secular rulers or authorities. </body></html>
