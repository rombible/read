We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it.

On that day&#8212;This was not immediately consequent on the dedication of the city wall and gates, but after Nehemiah's return from the Persian court to Jerusalem, his absence having extended over a considerable period. The transaction here described probably took place on one of the periodical occasions for the public readings of the law, when the people's attention was particularly directed to some violations of it which called for immediate correction. There is another instance afforded, in addition to those which have already fallen under our notice, of the great advantages resulting from the public and periodical reading of the divine law. It was an established provision for the religious instruction of the people, for diffusing a knowledge and a reverence for the sacred volume, as well as for removing those errors and corruptions which might, in the course of time, have crept in.<p>the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever&#8212;that is, not be incorporated into the Israelitish kingdom, nor united in marriage relations with that people (De 23:3, 4).

It does not appear whether the words ‘they separated from Israel’ denote merely ceremonial exclusion from participation in the worship and festivals of the holy people, or the forcible ejectment from their borders. The practical impossibility of so summary a policy is an objection to the latter interpretation. The parallel in <a href="/nehemiah/9-2.htm" title="And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.">Nehemiah 9:2</a> gives some support to the former alternative; and the instance recorded by Nehemiah in the following <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-4.htm" title="And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:...">Nehemiah 13:4-14</a>, shows that Nehemiah’s anger was kindled not at the presence of a stranger but at his connexion with the high-priest, and at the fact of his not being ‘separated from’ the Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the mixed multitude</span>] The use of the Hebrew word ‘’ereb’ here without an article may be illustrated by <a href="/exodus/12-38.htm" title="And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.">Exodus 12:38</a>. There, as here, the word denotes the large body of strangers, members of other races, attached by ties of marriage or by commercial interests to the people of Israel. Their proneness to lead the Israelites astray was proverbial, cf. <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm" title="And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?">Numbers 11:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They separated from Israel all the mixed multitude</span>. Some lengthy process, like that pursued by Ezra (<a href="/ezra/10-10.htm">Ezra 10:10-19</a>), is probably glanced at in these words, and again in the opening words of ver. 30 - "Thus cleansed I them from all strangers." The rebukes of Nehemiah (vers. 25-27) did not suffice to produce a voluntary putting away of the foreign wives. Judicial proceedings had to be taken, and the "mixed multitude" separated off by authority. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The joint efforts of Nehemiah and Ezra succeeded both in restoring the enactments of the law for the performance and maintenance of the public worship, and in carrying out the separation of the community from strangers, especially by the dissolution of unlawful marriages (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44-13:3</a>). When Nehemiah, however, returned to the king at Babylon, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, and remained there some time, the abuses which had been abolished were again allowed by the people. During Nehemiah's absence, Eliashib the priest prepared a chamber in the fore-court of the temple, as a dwelling for his son-in-law Tobiah the Ammonite. The delivery of their dues to the Levites (the first-fruits and tenths) was omitted, and the Sabbath desecrated by field-work and by buying and selling in Jerusalem; Jews married Ashdodite, Ammonitish, and Moabitish wives; even a son of the high priest Joiada allying himself by marriage with Sanballat the Horonite. All these illegal acts were energetically opposed by Nehemiah at his return to Jerusalem, when he strove both to purify the congregation from foreigners, and to restore the appointments of the law with respect to divine worship (13:4-31).<p>The narration of these events and of the proceedings of Nehemiah in the last section of this book, is introduced by a brief summary (in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44-13:3</a>) of what was done for the ordering of divine worship, and for the separation of Israel from strangers; and this introduction is so annexed to what precedes, not only by the formula &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; (<a href="/nehemiah/12-33.htm">Nehemiah 12:33</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1</a>), but also by its contents, that it might be regarded as a summary of what Nehemiah had effected during his first stay at Jerusalem. It is not till the connective &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, "and before this" (<a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>), with which the recital of what occurred during Nehemiah's absence from Jerusalem, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, beings, that we perceive that this description of the restored legal appointments relates not only to the time before the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, but applies also to that of Nehemiah's second stay at Jerusalem, and bears only the appearance of an introduction, being in fact a brief summary of all that Nehemiah effected both before and after the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes. This is a form of statement which, is to be explained by the circumstance that Nehemiah did not compile this narrative of his operations till the evening of his days.<p><a href="/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a><p>The reformations in worship and in social life effected by Nehemiah. - <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44-47</a>.

Though the definition of time &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; corresponds with the &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; of <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-43.htm">Nehemiah 12:43</a>, it is nevertheless used in a more general sense, and does not refer, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-43.htm">Nehemiah 12:43</a>, to the day of the dedication of the wall, but only declares that what follows belongs chiefly to the time hitherto spoken of. &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; means, not merely a day of twelve or twenty-four hours, but very frequently stands for the time generally speaking at which anything occurs, or certum quoddam temporis spatium; and it is only from the context that we can perceive whether &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is used in its narrower or more extended meaning. Hence &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; is often used in the historical and prophetical books, de die, or de tempore modo memorato, in contradistinction to &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, the time present to the narrator; comp. <a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-25.htm">1 Samuel 30:25</a>, and the discussion in Gesen.
