We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it.

But in all this was not I at Jerusalem&#8212;Eliashib (concluding that, as Nehemiah had departed from Jerusalem, and, on the expiry of his allotted term of absence, had resigned his government, he had gone not to return) began to use great liberties, and, there being none left whose authority or frown he dreaded, allowed himself to do things most unworthy of his sacred office, and which, though in unison with his own irreligious character, he would not have dared to attempt during the residence of the pious governor. Nehemiah resided twelve years as governor of Jerusalem, and having succeeded in repairing and refortifying the city, he at the end of that period returned to his duties in Shushan. How long [Nehemiah] remained there is not expressly said, but "after certain days," which is a Scripture phraseology for a year or a number of years, he obtained leave to resume the government of Jerusalem; to his deep mortification and regret, he found matters in the neglected and disorderly state here described. Such gross irregularities as were practised, such extraordinary corruptions as had crept in, evidently imply the lapse of a considerable time. Besides, they exhibit the character of Eliashib, the high priest, in a most unfavorable light; for while he ought, by his office, to have preserved the inviolable sanctity of the temple and its furniture, his influence had been directly exercised for evil; especially he had given permission and countenance to a most indecent outrage&#8212;the appropriation of the best apartments in the sacred building to a heathen governor, one of the worst and most determined enemies of the people and the worship of God. The very first reform Nehemiah on his second visit resolved upon, was the stopping of this gross profanation [by Eliashib]. The chamber which had been polluted by the residence of the idolatrous Ammonite was, after undergoing the process of ritual purification (Nu 15:9), restored to its proper use&#8212;a storehouse for the sacred vessels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All this time was not I at Jerusalem; </span> and Eliashib took the occasion of my absence to do these things, supposing that I would no more return thither. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Came I unto the king, </span> to wit, from Jerusalem; where he had been once and again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">After certain days, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">in the end of days</span>, or <span class="ital">of a year</span>, as that word oft signifies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem,....

The verse can be only understood as saying: "for in the days of David, Asaph was of old chief of the singers, and of the songs of praise, and of the thanksgiving unto God." &#1493; before Asaph is here out of place; for to take it as introducing a conclusion: in the days of David, therefore, was Asaph ... seems unnatural.

The matter, however, of these passages is consistent with the naming of David and Asaph, while such a co-ordination is unsuitable in the present passage. The Masoretes have indeed attempted to make sense of the words by altering the singular &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; into the plural &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; but the Keri &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is nothing more than a worthless conjecture, arising partly from the unsuitableness of &#1493; before &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, and partly from the consideration that Henan and Ethan were, as well as Asaph, chiefs of bands of singers. Nehemiah, however, was not concerned in this passage about exactness of statement, - the mention of Asaph as chief of the singers being quite sufficient for the purpose of his remark, that from the times of David onward orders of singers had existed. - In <a href="/nehemiah/12-47.htm">Nehemiah 12:47</a> this subject is concluded by the general statement that all Israel, i.e., the whole community, in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, gave the portions prescribed in the law for the ministers of the sanctuary, singers, doorkeepers, Levites, and priests. &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, they were sanctifying, i.e., consecrabant. &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, to sanctify, said of the bringing of gifts and dues to the ministers of the sanctuary; comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/26-27.htm">1 Chronicles 26:27</a>; <a href="/leviticus/27-14.htm">Leviticus 27:14</a>.
