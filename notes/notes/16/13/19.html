Religion never prospers while sabbaths are trodden under foot. No wonder there was a general decay of religion, and corruption of manners among the Jews, when they forsook the sanctuary and profaned the sabbath. Those little consider what an evil they do, who profane the sabbath. We must answer for the sins others are led to commit by our example. Nehemiah charges it on them as an evil thing, for so it is, proceeding from contempt of God and our own souls. He shows that sabbath-breaking was one of the sins for which God had brought judgments upon them; and if they did not take warning, but returned to the same sins again, they had to expect further judgments. The courage, zeal, and prudence of Nehemiah in this matter, are recorded for us to do likewise; and we have reason to think, that the cure he wrought was lasting. He felt and confessed himself a sinner, who could demand nothing from God as justice, when he thus cried unto him for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The gates were closed at the sunset of the day before the Sabbath; since the Sabbath was regarded as commencing on the previous evening. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 13:15-31.

In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine-presses on the sabbath&#8212;The cessation of the temple services had been necessarily followed by a public profanation of the Sabbath, and this had gone so far that labor was carried on in the fields, and fish brought to the markets on the sacred day. Nehemiah took the decisive step of ordering the city gates to be shut, and not to be opened, till the Sabbath was past; and in order to ensure the faithful execution of this order, he stationed some of his own servants as guards, to prevent the introduction of any commodities on that day. On the merchants and various dealers finding admission denied them, they set up booths outside the walls, in hopes of still driving a traffic with the peasantry; but the governor threatened, if they continued, to adopt violent measures for their removal. For this purpose a body of Levites was stationed as sentinels at the gate, with discretionary powers to protect the sanctification of the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark; </span> which was about sun-setting, by reason of the mountains which were round about and near Jerusalem, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/125-2.htm" title="As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.">Psalm 125:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Some of my servants set I at the gates, </span> out of a diffidence in those to whom the keeping of the gates was committed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath,....

The Jews have always reckoned their days from sunset to sunset, grounding their practice on the account of the Creation given in the first chapter of Genesis, where "the evening and the morning" arc said to constitute each of the six days. There was also a special command that the "sabbath" of the great day of atonement should be kept "from even to even" (<a href="/leviticus/23-32.htm">Leviticus 23:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I commanded that the gates should be shut</span>. The gates would as a matter of course have been shut at sunset. Nehemiah required that the closing should take place some half-hour earlier, when the shadows were lengthening, and the day was drawing towards a close. He regarded it as a sort of desecration of the sabbath to carry on secular work to the last allowable moment. <span class="cmt_word">Some of my servants</span>.
