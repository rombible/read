Nehemiah receiving no recompense, perhaps not even thanks, from those for whose benefit he did these things, he looks up to God as his paymaster, and refers himself and his actions to his consideration; not in pride, or as boasting of what he had done, much less depending upon it as his righteousness, or as if he thought he had made God his debtor, but in an humble appeal to him concerning his integrity and pure intention in all this service, and a believing expectation that God would <span class="ital">not be unrighteous to forget his</span> <span class="ital">work and labour of love.

They shall in nowise lose their reward. Here again we find, (see <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm" title="Think on me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.">Nehemiah 5:19</a>,) that Nehemiah was employed much in pious ejaculations; and on every occasion looked up to God, and committed himself and his affairs to him. He here reflects with comfort upon what he had done for the house and service of God, and it afforded him much satisfaction to think that he had been any way instrumental to revive and support religion in his country, and to reform what was amiss. In like manner the kindness which any show to God’s ministers and people, and the care and labour they take to aid his cause, shall be returned into their own bosoms, in the secret joy they shall have there, not only through a consciousness of having done well, but of having glorified God, and done good of the best kind, spiritual good, to the souls of men.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:10-14 If a sacred character will not keep men from setting an evil example, it must not shelter any one from deserved blame and punishment. The Levites had been wronged; their portions had not been given them. They were gone to get livelihoods for themselves and their families, for their profession would not maintain them. A maintenance not sufficient, makes a poor ministry. The work is neglected, because the workmen are. Nehemiah laid the fault upon the rulers. Both ministers and people, who forsake religion and the services of it, and magistrates, who do not what they can to keep them to it, will have much to answer for. He delayed not to bring the Levites to their places again, and that just payment should be made. Nehemiah on every occasion looked up to God, and committed himself and all his affairs to Him. It pleased him to think that he had been of use to revive and support religion in his country. He here refers to God, not in pride, but with a humble appeal concerning his honest intention in what he had done. He prays, Remember me; not, Reward me. Wipe not out my good deeds; not, Publish them, or record them. Yet he was rewarded, and his good deeds recorded.

And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them&#8212;The people, disgusted with the malversations of Eliashib, or the lax and irregular performance of the sacred rites, withheld the tithes, so that the ministers of religion were compelled for their livelihood to withdraw to their patrimonial possessions in the country. The temple services had ceased; all religious duties had fallen into neglect. The money put into the sacred treasury had been squandered in the entertainment of an Ammonite heathen, an open and contemptuous enemy of God and His people. The return of the governor put an end to these disgraceful and profane proceedings. He administered a sharp rebuke to those priests to whom the management of the temple and its services was committed, for the total neglect of their duties, and the violation of the solemn promises which they had made to him at his departure. He upbraided them with the serious charge of having not only withheld from men their dues, but of having robbed God, by neglecting the care of His house and service. And thus having roused them to a sense of duty and incited them to testify their godly sorrow for their criminal negligence by renewed devotedness to their sacred work, Nehemiah restored the temple services. He recalled the dispersed Levites to the regular discharge of their duties; while the people at large, perceiving that their contributions would be no longer perverted to improper uses, willingly brought in their tithes as formerly. Men of integrity and good report were appointed to act as trustees of the sacred treasures, and thus order, regularity, and active service were re-established in the temple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Concerning this:</span> what I have done with an upright heart for thy house and service be pleased graciously to accept, and remember for my good, according to thy promise. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Remember me, O my God, concerning this,....

The actual phrase is not found elsewhere in the O.T. The metaphor, which is that of sponging off from the leathern roll of record, is familiar to us from <a href="/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written....">Exodus 32:32-33</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">my good deeds</span>] Literally, ‘my mercies or kindnesses’ (LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span>, Vulg. ‘miserationes’). At first sight the word seems scarcely appropriate. Does it signify Nehemiah’s acts of kindness on behalf of the Levites? or his acts of love and reverence, ‘good deeds,’ towards his God? The word in the Hebrew ‘<span class="ital">khesed</span>’ is the one commonly used of God’s mercy towards mankind and of the loving-kindness of man towards man. It occurs however also, though more rarely, of man’s love responding to the Divine mercy. In this sense probably it is found, as here, in the plural in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-32.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.">2 Chronicles 32:32</a> ‘the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds,’ <a href="/2_chronicles/35-26.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,">2 Chronicles 35:26</a> ‘the rest of the acts of Josiah and his good deeds.’ These ‘good deeds’ (the plur. of ‘<span class="ital">khesed</span>’) are clearly the efforts of these two kings to live in more thorough compliance with the ceremonial of the Law. We may remember too that the ‘pious’ Israelite was the ‘khasîd,’ and in the 2nd cent. b.c. ‘Asideans’ (<span class="ital">khasidim</span>) was the name given to the most fanatical of the forerunners of the Pharisees.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not likely that Hosea’s use of the word in the singular (<a href="/nehemiah/6-4.htm" title="Yet they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.">Nehemiah 6:4</a> ‘your goodness is as a morning cloud,’ 6 ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice’) throws any light upon its usage in the present verse beyond showing that it was <span class="ital">possibly</span> applied in his time to man’s attitude towards God; but this interpretation is very doubtful. The Rabbinical teaching on the subject of <span class="ital">khasadim</span> made ‘the bestowal of kindness’ equivalent to ‘man’s duty to his neighbour.’ Compare the saying of Simon the Just quoted in the note on <a href="/nehemiah/10-37.htm" title="And that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.">Nehemiah 10:37</a>, and see Taylor’s note in <span class="ital">Sayings of the Jewish Fathers</span>, pp. 26, 27.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the house of my God</span>] See on <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm" title="And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.
