In the education of children, great care should be taken about the government of their tongues; that they learn not the language of Ashdod, no impious or impure talk, no corrupt communication. Nehemiah showed the evil of these marriages. Some, more obstinate than the rest, he smote, that is, ordered them to be beaten by the officers according to the law, De 25:2,3. Here are Nehemiah's prayers on this occasion He prays, Remember them, O my God. Lord, convince and convert them; put them in mind of what they should be and do. The best services to the public have been forgotten by those for whom they were done, therefore Nehemiah refers himself to God, to recompense him. This may well be the summary of our petitions; we need no more to make us happy than this; Remember me, O my God, for good. We may humbly hope that the Lord will remember us and our services, although, after lives of unwearied activity and usefulness, we shall still see cause to abhor ourselves and repent in dust and ashes, and to cry out with Nehemiah, Spare me, O my God, according to the greatness of they mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wards - Rather, "the offices or observances."

From the circumstance, too, that a portion of the children of these marriages were not able to speak the language of the Jews, but spoke the language of Ashdod, or of this or that nation from which their mothers were descended, we may conclude with tolerable certainty, that these people dwelt neither in Jerusalem nor in the midst of the Jewish community, but on the borders of the nations to which their wives belonged. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; like <a href="/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; precedes in an absolute sense: and as for their children, one half (of them) spake. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1514; (comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-11.htm">Isaiah 36:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-18.htm">2 Chronicles 32:18</a>) is the language of the Jewish community, the vernacular Hebrew.

The speech of Ashdod is that of the Philistines, which, according to Hitzig (Urgeschichte u. Mythol. der Philister), belonged to the Indo-Germanic group. The languages, however, of the Moabites and Ammonites were undoubtedly Shemitic, but so dialectically different from the Hebrew, that they might be regarded as foreign tongues. </body></html>
