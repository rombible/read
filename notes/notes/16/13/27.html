In the education of children, great care should be taken about the government of their tongues; that they learn not the language of Ashdod, no impious or impure talk, no corrupt communication. Nehemiah showed the evil of these marriages. Some, more obstinate than the rest, he smote, that is, ordered them to be beaten by the officers according to the law, De 25:2,3. Here are Nehemiah's prayers on this occasion He prays, Remember them, O my God. Lord, convince and convert them; put them in mind of what they should be and do. The best services to the public have been forgotten by those for whom they were done, therefore Nehemiah refers himself to God, to recompense him. This may well be the summary of our petitions; we need no more to make us happy than this; Remember me, O my God, for good. We may humbly hope that the Lord will remember us and our services, although, after lives of unwearied activity and usefulness, we shall still see cause to abhor ourselves and repent in dust and ashes, and to cry out with Nehemiah, Spare me, O my God, according to the greatness of they mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The speech of Ashdod - The Philistine language, which was akin to that of Egypt.<p>According to the language of each people - The children spoke a mixed dialect - half-Philistine, half-Hebrew. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. cursed them&#8212;that is, pronounced on them an anathema which entailed excommunication.<p>smote &#8230; and plucked off their hair&#8212;To cut off the hair of offenders seems to be a punishment rather disgraceful than severe; yet it is supposed that pain was added to disgrace, and that they tore off the hair with violence as if they were plucking a bird alive.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall we then hearken unto you?</span> shall we justify our action by permitting or not punishing it?
