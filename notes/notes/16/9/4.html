Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Septuagint and the Vulgate remove the comma after "stairs."

According to a common but inaccurate punctuation of the A.V., <span class="ital">of the Levites</span> is applied to the list of names which follows. It refers to the pulpit or stage erected for the Levites, that they might read the Law and conduct the service standing in view of the people. Cf. <a href="/nehemiah/8-4.htm" title="And Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.">Nehemiah 8:4</a>. For the word rendered ‘stairs’ (LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀνάβασις</span>. Vulg. ‘gradus’) compare <a href="/nehemiah/12-37.htm" title="And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.">Nehemiah 12:37</a>. It more generally appears as ‘ascent,’ e.g. <a href="/joshua/10-10.htm" title="And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.">Joshua 10:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm" title="And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm" title="My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee to Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.">Isaiah 15:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jeshua</span>, &c.] See note on <a href="/nehemiah/8-7.htm" title="Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.">Nehemiah 8:7</a>; cf. <a href="/nehemiah/10-9.htm" title="And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;">Nehemiah 10:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Kadmiel</span>] cf. <a href="/nehemiah/10-9.htm" title="And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;">Nehemiah 10:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bani … Bunni … Bani</span>] The repetition of Bani’s name is probably due to an error of copyists. The Syriac version for the second ‘Bani’ reads ‘Binnui’; but as in <a href="/nehemiah/10-9.htm" title="And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;">Nehemiah 10:9</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/12-8.htm" title="Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brothers.">Nehemiah 12:8</a>, Binnui’s name comes, as here, between those of Jeshua and Kadmiel, we should here substitute Binnui for the first Bani. The LXX. renders all three names as if the Hebrew in each case had been ‘B’nêy’ = ‘sons of,’ reducing the number of proper names in the verse to five (<span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Καδμιήλ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Σεχενία υἱὸς Σαραβία</span>, <span class="greekheb">υἱοὶ Χωνενί</span>). For ‘Bunni,’ cf. <a href="/nehemiah/10-15.htm" title="Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,">Nehemiah 10:15</a>; for ‘Shebaniah,’ ‘Sherebiah,’ cf. <a href="/nehemiah/10-12.htm" title="Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,">Nehemiah 10:12</a>. The names probably represent the chief Levitical houses and not individuals; cf. the mention of Jeshua, Binnui, and Kadmiel in <a href="/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.">Ezra 2:40</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-9.htm" title="Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.">Ezra 3:9</a>, and of Sherebiah in <a href="/ezra/8-18.htm" title="And by the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;">Ezra 8:18</a>.

This statement is not to be understood as saying that the heads of the people sought in the law, fourteen days before the feast, for information as to what they would have to do, that they might prepare for the due celebration of the feast of tabernacles (Bertheau). The text only states that the heads of the people again betook themselves to Ezra on the second day, to receive from him instruction in the law, and that in reading the law they found the precept concerning the celebration of the festival in booths, i.e., they met with this precept, and were thereby induced to celebrate the approaching festival in strict accordance with its directions. The law concerning the feast of tabernacles, of which the essentials are here communicated, is found <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39-43</a>. In <a href="/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a> they were only commanded to keep the feast with gladness. The particular of dwelling in booths or bowers is taken from <a href="/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>; the further details in <a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a> relate to the carrying out of the direction: "He shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook" (<a href="/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>). Go to the mountain, a woody district, whence branches may be obtained. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, state constructive plural of &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, leaf, foliage, here leafy boughs or branches of trees. &#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, the olive, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1506;&#1509;, the wild olive (oleaster), the myrtle, the palm, and branches of thick-leaved trees, are here mentioned (the two latter being also named in Leviticus). &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not relate to the preparation of the booths, but to the precept that the feast should be kept in booths. In <a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a> the accomplishment of the matter is related, presupposing a compliance with the proclamation sent out into all the cities in the land, and indeed so speedy a compliance that the booths were finished by the day of the feast. The object (the branches of <a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>) must be supplied to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; from the context. They made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the open space at the water-gate (see on <a href="/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>), and the open space at the gate of Ephraim. On the situation of this gate, see rem. on <a href="/nehemiah/3-8.htm">Nehemiah 3:8</a>. The open space before it must be thought of as within the city walls. On these two public places, booths were probably made by those who had come to Jerusalem, but did not dwell there; while the priests and Levites belonging to other places would build theirs in the courts of the temple.</body></html>
