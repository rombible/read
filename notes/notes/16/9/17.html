Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In their rebellion - The Septuagint and several maunscripts have "in Egypt" (the words in the original differing by one letter only), and translate - "And appointed a captain to return to their bondage in Egypt."

Thou, even thou, art Lord alone, &c.&#8212;In this solemn and impressive prayer, in which they make public confession of their sins, and deprecate the judgments due to the transgressions of their fathers, they begin with a profound adoration of God, whose supreme majesty and omnipotence is acknowledged in the creation, preservation, and government of all. Then they proceed to enumerate His mercies and distinguished favors to them as a nation, from the period of the call of their great ancestor and the gracious promise intimated to him in the divinely bestowed name of Abraham, a promise which implied that he was to be the Father of the faithful, the ancestor of the Messiah, and the honored individual in whose seed all the families of the earth should be blessed. Tracing in full and minute detail the signal instances of divine interposition for their deliverance and their interest&#8212;in their deliverance from Egyptian bondage&#8212;their miraculous passage through the Red Sea&#8212;the promulgation of His law&#8212;the forbearance and long-suffering shown them amid their frequent rebellions&#8212;the signal triumphs given them over their enemies&#8212;their happy settlement in the promised land&#8212;and all the extraordinary blessings, both in the form of temporal prosperity and of religious privilege, with which His paternal goodness had favored them above all other people, they charge themselves with making a miserable requital. They confess their numerous and determined acts of disobedience. They read, in the loss of their national independence and their long captivity, the severe punishment of their sins. They acknowledge that, in all heavy and continued judgments upon their nation, God had done right, but they had done wickedly. And in throwing themselves on His mercy, they express their purpose of entering into a national covenant, by which they pledge themselves to dutiful obedience in future.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Refused to obey; </span> persisted in their disobedience after many admonitions, and invitations to repentance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Appointed a captain, </span> i.e. designed, purposed, and resolved to do so, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/14-4.htm" title="And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.">Numbers 14:4</a></span>, and therefore they are said to do so, as Abraham is said to have offered up Isaac, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/11-17.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,">Hebrews 11:17</a></span>, because he intended and attempted to do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And refused to obey,....
