Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou didst divide them into corners - i. e., parts of the holy land; or as some prefer "thou didst distribute them on all sides." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

But Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not." In these verses the conduct of the children of Israel towards God is contrasted with His kindness towards this stiff-necked people, the historical confirmation following in <a href="/nehemiah/9-18.htm">Nehemiah 9:18</a>. &#1493;&#1492;&#1501; is emphatic, and prefixed to contrast the conduct of the Israelites with the benefits bestowed on them. The contrast is enhanced by the &#1493; explicative before &#1488;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, even our fathers (which J. D. Michaelis would expunge, from a misconception of its meaning, but which Bertheau with good reason defends). Words are accumulated to describe the stiff-necked resistance of the people. &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; as above, <a href="/nehemiah/9-10.htm">Nehemiah 9:10</a>. "They hardened their necks" refers to <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a>, and therefore already alludes to the worship of the golden calf at Sinai, mentioned <a href="/nehemiah/9-18.htm">Nehemiah 9:18</a>; while in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>, the second great rebellion of the people at Kadesh, on the borders of the promised land, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>, is contemplated. The repetition of the expression, "they hardened their hearts," shows that a second grievous transgression is already spoken of in <a href="/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>. This is made even clearer by the next clause, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which is taken almost verbally from <a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a> : "They said one to another, Let us make a captain (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;), and return to Egypt;" the notion being merely enhanced here by the addition &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1501;, to their bondage. The comparison with <a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a> also shows that &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is a clerical error for &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as the lxx read; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, in their stubbornness, after &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1501;, gives no appropriate sense. In spite, however, of their stiff-neckedness, God of His mercy and goodness did not forsake them. &#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, a God of pardons; comp. <a href="/daniel/9-9.htm">Daniel 9:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; is a reminiscence of <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>.
