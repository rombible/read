Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and in Chronicles:<p> 1 Chron ehemiah  Tribes of Judah    Of Pharez  468  Of Zerah 690   Tribe of Benjamin 956 928  Tribe of Levi    Priests 1760 1192  Levites  284  Porters 212 172  <p>According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a total population of 14,936. According to Chronicles, supplemented from Nehemiah, the adult males were 4,370, and consequently the entire population, would have been 17,480. As the Nethinims and the Israelites of Ephraim and Manasseh <a href="/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a> are not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-2</a>, was not much short of 20,000.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. overseer&#8212;that is, "captain" or "chief."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their overseer; </span> the captain of their thousand. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer,....

He was ‘deputy overseer,’ or second in command to Joel. Cf. ‘brethren of the second degree’ <a href="/1_chronicles/15-18.htm" title="And with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.">1 Chronicles 15:18</a>, ‘second to him’ <a href="/1_chronicles/16-5.htm" title="Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>. It is not, however, quite certain that the traditional translation adopted in the English version is correct. In the opinion of some scholars the word rendered ‘second’ qualifies ‘the city,’ which in the Hebrew it immediately follows. It will not then denote the rank of Judah the son of Hassenuah, but the quarter of the capital over which he was overseer. Cf. <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2 Kings 22:14</a>, ‘She (Huldah) dwelt in Jerusalem, in the second quarter.’ <a href="/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-10.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.">Zephaniah 1:10</a>.

The repetition of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; after &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497; is not to be understood as contrasting those who dwelt in the cities with the dwellers in Jerusalem in the sense of "but in the cities of Judah dwelt," etc., but is here a mere pleonasm. Even the enumeration of the different classes of inhabitants: Israel, the priests, etc., clearly shows that no such contrast is intended; for Israel, the priests, etc., dwelt not only in Jerusalem, but also, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-20.htm">Nehemiah 11:20</a>, in the other cities of Judah. And this is placed beyond all doubt by the contents of the list following; the inhabitants of Jerusalem being enumerated vv. 4-24, and the inhabitants of the other cities of Judah and Benjamin, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25-36</a>. If, however, this title refers to the whole of the following list, it cannot, as Rambach and others thought, contain only an enumeration of those who, in consequence of the lot, had taken up their residence at Jerusalem, but must be intended as a list of the population of the whole province of Judah in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. It seems strange that the title should announce &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, while in the list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem are given, besides the heads, the numbers of their brethren, i.e., of the individuals or fathers of families under these heads; and that in the list of the inhabitants of the other cities, only inhabitants of Judah and Benjamin are spoken of. Hence this statement refers a potiori to the heads, including the houses and families belonging to them, while in the case of the other cities it is assumed that the inhabitants of each locality were under a head. With <a href="/nehemiah/11-4.htm">Nehemiah 11:4</a> begins the enumeration of the heads dwelling in Jerusalem, with their houses; and the first clause contains a special title, which affirms that (certain) of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin dwelt at Jerusalem. On the parallel list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem before the captivity, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2-34</a>, and its relation to the present list, see the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9.htm">1 Chronicles 9</a>.</body></html>
