Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and in Chronicles:<p> 1 Chron ehemiah  Tribes of Judah    Of Pharez  468  Of Zerah 690   Tribe of Benjamin 956 928  Tribe of Levi    Priests 1760 1192  Levites  284  Porters 212 172  <p>According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a total population of 14,936. According to Chronicles, supplemented from Nehemiah, the adult males were 4,370, and consequently the entire population, would have been 17,480. As the Nethinims and the Israelites of Ephraim and Manasseh <a href="/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a> are not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-2</a>, was not much short of 20,000.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah&#8212;The discrepancy that is apparent between this [Ne 11:4-36] and the list formerly given in 1Ch 9:1-9, arose not only from the Jewish and Oriental practice of changing or modifying the names of persons from a change of circumstances, but from the alterations that must have been produced in the course of time. The catalogue in Chronicles contains those who came with the first detachment of returned exiles, while the list in this passage probably included also those who returned with Ezra and Nehemiah; or it was most probably made out afterwards, when several had died, or some, who had been inserted as going on the journey, remained, and others came in their stead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And these are the sons of Benjamin,....

But otherwise the lists here vary from one another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8</span> <span class="ital">Gabbai, Sallai</span>] The occurrence of these names, not separated by the copula, is peculiar. No connexion can be traced between the ‘Gabbai, Sallai, … Joel, … Judah,’ of our list with the ‘Ibneiah, Elah and Meshullam’ in <a href="/1_chronicles/9-8.htm" title="And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;">1 Chronicles 9:8</a>. But there are certain peculiarities in the two lists at this point which make us suspect that the text of the original document was here at fault. Thus in our text we may remark on (1) the abruptness of ‘after him Gabbai, Sallai,’ (2) the number 928 differing from, but yet sufficiently close to, that of 956 in 1 Chron. Sallai, it has been conjectured, is the name Sallu repeated, which has crept into the text from a gloss on the word ‘after him.’ In 1 Chronicles we remark upon Meshullam occurring twice, and Ibneiah by the side of Ibnijah. The number 928, if we may argue from the analogy of <a href="/nehemiah/11-6.htm" title="All the sons of Perez that dwelled at Jerusalem were four hundred three score and eight valiant men.">Nehemiah 11:6</a>, relates only to the house of Sallai or Gabbai Sallai. In <a href="/1_chronicles/9-9.htm" title="And their brothers, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers.">1 Chronicles 9:9</a>, the number 956 represents the sons of Benjamin.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these are the sons of Benjamin</span>. A verse equivalent to <a href="/1_chronicles/9-6.htm">1 Chronicles 9:6</a> would seem to have fallen out here. Nehemiah cannot have intended to leave out the descendants of Zerah, who formed more than one-half of the Jewish element in the population of Jerusalem, and furnished 690 fighting men. <span class="cmt_word">Sallu the son of Meshullam</span>. Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/9-7.htm">1 Chronicles 9:7</a>.

For while Nehemiah, after the completion of the wall, was occupied with the thought of bringing into the thinly populated capital a larger number of inhabitants, and had for this purpose convoked a public assembly, that a list of the whole Israelite population of the towns of Benjamin and Judah might be taken in hand, the seventh month of the year arrived, in which all the people assembled at Jerusalem to perform those acts of worship and solemnities (described <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8-10</a>) in which this month abounded. Hence it was not till after the termination of these services that Nehemiah was able to carry out the measures he had resolved on. For there can be no doubt that <a href="/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/11-2.htm">Nehemiah 11:2</a> of the present chapter narrate the execution of these measures. The statement that one in ten of all the people was appointed by lot to dwell in Jerusalem, and the remaining nine in other cities, and that the people blessed the men who showed themselves willing to dwell at Jerusalem, can have no other meaning than, that the inhabitants of Jerusalem were increased in this proportion, and that this was consequently the measure which God had, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a>, put it into Nehemiah's heart to take. The statement taken by itself is indeed very brief, and its connection with <a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a> not very evident. But the brevity and abruptness do not justify Bertheau's view, that these two verses are not the composition of Nehemiah himself, but only an extract from a larger context, in which this circumstance was fully explained. For Nehemiah's style not unfrequently exhibits a certain abruptness; comp. e.g., the commencements of chs. 5 and 6, or the information <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a>, which are no less abrupt, and which yet no one has conceived to be mere extracts from some other document. Besides, as the connection between <a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1</a> is interrupted by the relation of the events of the seventh month, so, too, is the account of the building of the wall, <a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15</a>., and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1</a>, interrupted by the insertion of occurrences which took place during its progress. The first sentence, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1</a>, "And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem," cannot be so closely connected with the next, "and the rest of the people cast lots," etc., as to place the rulers in direct contrast to the rest of the people, but must be understood by its retrospect to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-4.htm">Nehemiah 7:4</a>, which gives the following contrast: The rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem, but few of the people dwelt there; to this is joined the next sentence: and the rest of the people cast lots. The "rest of the people" does not mean the assembled people with the exception of the rulers, but the people with the exception of the few who dwelt at Jerusalem. These cast lots to bring (&#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;) one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem. The predicate, the holy city, occurs here and <a href="/nehemiah/11-18.htm">Nehemiah 11:18</a> for the first time. Jerusalem is so called, on the ground of the prophecies, <a href="/joel/3-17.htm">Joel 3:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a>, because the sanctuary of God, the temple, was there. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; means, in the other cities of Judah and Benjamin. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, those who showed themselves willing to dwell in Jerusalem, is taken by most expositors in contrast to those who were bound to do this in consequence of the decision of the lot; and it is then further supposed that some first went to Jerusalem of their free choice, and that the lot was then cast with respect to the rest. There are not, however, sufficient grounds for this conclusion, nor yet for the assumption that the decision of the lot was regarded as a constraint. The disposal of the lot was accepted as a divine decision, with which all had, whether willingly or unwillingly, to comply. All who willingly acquiesced in this decision might be designated as &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;; and these departed to Jerusalem accompanied by the blessings of the people. Individuals are not so much meant, as chiefly fathers of families, who went with their wives and children. </body></html>
