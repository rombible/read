The bulk of the Jews, it appears, rather chose to live in the country than at Jerusalem. One reason of which might be, that they were generally shepherds, and lovers of agriculture, and therefore the country was more suited to their genius and manner of life than the city. Add to this, that their enemies were now so enraged to see the walls built again, and so restless in their designs to keep Jerusalem from rising to its former splendour, that many were terrified from coming to dwell there, thinking themselves more safe in the country, where their enemies had no pretence to disturb them. In order, therefore, to compel a certain proportion of them to remove to the city, the expedient of casting lots is resorted to. Though the casting of lots be certainly forbidden, where the thing is done out of a spirit of superstition, or with a design to tempt God; yet on some occasions it is enjoined by God himself, and the most holy persons, both in the Old and New Testaments, have practised it in particular cases. The wise man acknowledges the usefulness of this custom when he tells us that <span class="ital">the lot causeth contention to cease, and parteth between the mighty, </span><a href="/proverbs/18-18.htm" title="The lot causes contentions to cease, and parts between the mighty.">Proverbs 18:18</a>; and therefore it was no bad policy, as things now stood, to take this method of division; since the lot, which all allowed was under the divine direction, falling upon such a person rather than another, would be a great means, no doubt, to make him remove more contentedly into the city.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-36 The distribution of the people. - In all ages, men have preferred their own ease and advantage to the public good. Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To bring one of ten - Artificial enlargements of capitals by forcible transfers of population to them, were not unusual in ancient times. About 500 B.C., Syracuse became a great city in this way.

The Rulers, Voluntary Men, and Every Tenth Man Chosen by Lot, Dwell at Jerusalem.<p>1. the rulers &#8230; dwelt at Jerusalem&#8212;That city being the metropolis of the country, it was right and proper that the seat of government should be there. But the exigency of the times required that special measures should be taken to insure the residence of an adequate population for the custody of the buildings and the defense of the city. From the annoyances of restless and malignant enemies, who tried every means to demolish the rising fortifications, there was some danger attending a settlement in Jerusalem. Hence the greater part of the returned exiles, in order to earn as well as secure the rewards of their duty, preferred to remain in the country or the provincial towns. To remedy this state of things, it was resolved to select every tenth man of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin by lot, to become a permanent inhabitant of the capital. The necessity of such an expedient commended it to the general approval. It was the more readily submitted to because the lot was resorted to on all the most critical conjunctures of the Jewish history, and regarded by the people as a divine decision (Pr 18:18). This awakened strongly the national spirit; and patriotic volunteers came forward readily to meet the wishes of the authorities, a service which, implying great self-denial as well as courage, was reckoned in the circumstances of so much importance as entitled them to the public gratitude. No wonder that the conduct of these volunteers drew forth the tribute of public admiration; for they sacrificed their personal safety and comfort for the interests of the community because Jerusalem was at that time a place against which the enemies of the Jews were directing a thousand plots. Therefore, residence in it at such a juncture was attended with expense and various annoyances from which a country life was entirely free.The rulers and the tenth man chosen by lot dwell at Jerusalem, <span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/11-1.htm" title="And the rulers of the people dwelled at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.">Nehemiah 11:1</a>,2</span>.

But the difficulty remained how to secure the presence in greater numbers of those who, from lack of means or by reason of trade and occupation, could not so easily change their quarters.

Divine sanction had been given, in  the course of the Jewish history, to the use  of the lot for the selection of persons (Joshua 7:16-18 <a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19-21</a>), for the distribution of lands (<a href="/numbers/26-25.htm">Numbers 26:25, 26</a>), and  for the determination of the order in which  different bodies should execute an office  (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-5.htm">1 Chronicles 24:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/25-8.htm">1 Chronicles 25:8</a>).

For this purpose, it was indispensable to guarantee the contributions prescribed for the necessary expenses of the temple worship, and the support of its ministers. Hence this entering into a solemn agreement to observe the law was regarded as a suitable occasion for regulating the services prescribed by the law with respect to the temple and its ministers, and mutually binding themselves to their observance.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-33.htm">Nehemiah 10:33-34</a><p>We ordained for ourselves (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, upon us, inasmuch as such things are spoken of as are taken upon one). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, to lay upon ourselves the third part of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God.

The view of Aben Ezra, that a third of a shekel was to be paid in addition to the half shekel levied in conformity with the law, is unsupported by the text. &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, the service of the house of God, is not the building and repairs of the temple, but the regular worship. For, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-34.htm">Nehemiah 10:34</a>, the tax was to be applied to defraying the expenses of worship, to supplying the shew-bread, the continual meat and burnt offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-8</a>), the sacrifices for the Sabbaths, new moons (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9-15</a>), and festivals (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16-29</a>, 38), - for the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, holy gifts, by which, from their position between the burnt-offering and the sin-offering, we may understand the thank-offerings, which were offered in the name of the congregation, as e.g., the two lambs at Pentecost, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-19.htm">Leviticus 23:19</a>, and the offerings brought at feasts of dedication, comp. <a href="/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/6-17.htm">Ezra 6:17</a>, - for the sin-offerings which were sacrificed at every great festival; and finally for all the work of the house of our God, i.e., whatever else was needful for worship (&#1500; must be supplied from the context before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;). The establishment of such a tax for the expenses of worship, does not justify the view that the contributions promised by Artaxerxes in his edict, <a href="/ezra/7-20.htm">Ezra 7:20</a>., of things necessary to worship had ceased, and that the congregation had now to defray the expenses from their own resources. For it may readily be supposed, that besides the assistance afforded by the king, the congregation might also esteem it needful to furnish a contribution, to meet the increased requirements of worship, and thus to augment the revenues of the temple, - the royal alms being limited to a certain amount (see <a href="/ezra/7-22.htm">Ezra 7:22</a>).</body></html>
