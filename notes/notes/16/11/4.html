Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and in Chronicles:<p> 1 Chron ehemiah  Tribes of Judah    Of Pharez  468  Of Zerah 690   Tribe of Benjamin 956 928  Tribe of Levi    Priests 1760 1192  Levites  284  Porters 212 172  <p>According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a total population of 14,936.

As the Nethinims and the Israelites of Ephraim and Manasseh <a href="/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a> are not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-2</a>, was not much short of 20,000.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah&#8212;The discrepancy that is apparent between this [Ne 11:4-36] and the list formerly given in 1Ch 9:1-9, arose not only from the Jewish and Oriental practice of changing or modifying the names of persons from a change of circumstances, but from the alterations that must have been produced in the course of time. The catalogue in Chronicles contains those who came with the first detachment of returned exiles, while the list in this passage probably included also those who returned with Ezra and Nehemiah; or it was most probably made out afterwards, when several had died, or some, who had been inserted as going on the journey, remained, and others came in their stead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The children of Judah and of Benjamin; </span> for to these two tribes this city anciently and most properly belonged, although some also of other tribes dwelt in it; of which, and other things relating to this catalogue, see <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/9-3.htm" title="And in Jerusalem dwelled of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;">1 Chronicles 9:3</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Athaiah, </span> and his family and relations with him, and under him as their head, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/11-6.htm" title="All the sons of Perez that dwelled at Jerusalem were four hundred three score and eight valiant men.">Nehemiah 11:6</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin,....

On "the first of the wine and oil," comp. <a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>. These offerings of first-fruits were to be brought into the chambers of the house of God, where they were to be kept in store, and distributed to the priests for their support. "And the tithes of our ground (will we bring) to the Levites; and they, the Levites, receive the tithes in all our country towns.

The parenthetical sentences in these verses, &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, have been variously understood. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in the Piel and Hiphil meaning elsewhere to pay tithe, comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>, many expositors adhere to this meaning in these passages also, and translate <a href="/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a> : for they, the Levites, must give again the tenth (to the priests); and <a href="/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a> : when the Levites give the tenth; while the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, Rashi, Aben Ezra, Clericus, Bertheau, and others, take &#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512; and &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1512; in these sentences as signifying to collect tithe. We prefer the latter view, as giving a more suitable sense. For the remark that the Levites must give back the tenth (<a href="/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>) does not present so appropriate a motive for the demand that the tithes should be paid, as that the tithes are due to the Levites. Still less does the addition, in our agricultural towns, suit the sentence: the Levites must give back the tithe to the priests. Again, the fact that it is not said till <a href="/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a> that the Levites have to give the tenth of the tenth to the priests, speaks still more against this view. A priest is to be present when the Levites take the tenth, so that the share of the priests may not be lessened. On "the tenth of the tenth," comp. <a href="/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a>. Hezekiah had provided store-chambers in the temple, in which to deposit the tithes, <a href="/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11</a>.</body></html>
