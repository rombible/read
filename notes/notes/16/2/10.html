The news of his mission quickly spread, although its precise object was not known (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm" title="And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode on.">Nehemiah 2:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-16.htm" title="And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.">Nehemiah 2:16</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sanballat and Tobiah appear throughout the book as the bitterest foes he had to encounter. ‘Sanballat,’ or, as perhaps it should be called, Saneballat (LXX. <span class="greekheb">Σαναβαλλὰτ</span>, Josephus <span class="greekheb">Σαναβαλλέτης</span>) is probably an Assyrian name, meaning ‘Sin (the moon-god of the Assyrians) giveth life,’ just as Nabubalitanni means ‘Nebo giveth the life.’ The name of the moon-god appears also in Sennacherib = ‘Sin gives many brothers.’ Sanballat is distinguished as ‘the Horonite,’ by which is probably meant ‘dweller in Beth-horon,’ a town on the borders of Ephraim (<a href="/joshua/16-3.htm" title="And goes down westward to the coast of Japhleti, to the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea.">Joshua 16:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/16-5.htm" title="And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, to Bethhoron the upper;">Joshua 16:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-13.htm" title="And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lies on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.">Joshua 18:13</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-22.htm" title="And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities.">Joshua 21:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-5.htm" title="Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;">2 Chronicles 8:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-13.htm" title="But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.">2 Chronicles 25:13</a>), about 18 miles N.W. of Jerusalem, upon the main road leading to the plain of the coast. Beth-horon commanded the pass into the mountains. Strategically it was a place of great importance. It is famous for its connexion with the victories of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm" title="And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.">Joshua 10:10</a>), of Judas Maccabeus (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-15.htm" title="So he made him ready to go up, and there went with him a mighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of the children of Israel.">1Ma 3:15</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/7-39.htm" title="So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him.">1Ma 7:39</a>), and as the scene of the overthrow of Cestius Gallus (Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell. J.</span> ii. 19. 8).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sanballat was evidently one of the leaders of the Samaritan community (see on <a href="/nehemiah/4-2.htm" title="And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?">Nehemiah 4:2</a>). Some scholars imagine from the frequent conjunction of his name with that of Tobiah the Ammonite, that Sanballat must have been a Moabite, and that the title ‘Horonite’ denotes a dweller in ‘Horonaim,’ a town in Southern Moab, mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm" title="My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee to Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-3.htm" title="A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.">Jeremiah 48:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-5.htm" title="For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.">Jeremiah 48:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-34.htm" title="From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.">Jeremiah 48:34</a>, and twice in the Inscription of the Moabite Stone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite</span>] Why Tobiah is called ‘the servant’ is not clear. It may denote that he once held some position under the Persian governor or under the king. Rawlinson’s suggestion that he was Sanballat’s secretary and councillor, and had originally been an Ammonite slave, is less probable. He is generally mentioned on an equality with Sanballat, and in <a href="/nehemiah/6-12.htm" title="And, see, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.">Nehemiah 6:12</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>, his name stands first. Frequent mention is made of Tobiah’s intrigues against the work and authority of Nehemiah. According to some, the termination ‘-jah’ shows him to have been a renegade Jew: cf. <a href="/ezra/2-60.htm" title="The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.">Ezra 2:60</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-10.htm" title="Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come you the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;">Zechariah 6:10</a>, where the same name occurs. His son’s name, Jehohanan (<a href="/nehemiah/6-18.htm" title="For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.">Nehemiah 6:18</a>), is also compounded of the Jewish Sacred Name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The race-hatred between the Jews and the Ammonites and Moabites (see <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-1.htm" title="On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;...">Nehemiah 13:1-2</a>) may explain in some degree Tobiah’s hostility. But in all probability the Samaritans and the neighbouring nations (Moabites, Ammonites, Arabians, &c.) were combined in the desire to foil any effort made to reinstate Jerusalem in her old position of being the most powerful town in Palestine. The policy of Nehemiah would weaken the neighbouring tribes in proportion as it would strengthen the Jews.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tobiah may have in some way represented the Ammonites, possibly as governor of their small community, having received the position from the court where he had been a slave (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-6.htm" title="Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.">Ecclesiastes 10:6</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-8.htm" title="Servants have ruled over us: there is none that does deliver us out of their hand.">Lamentations 5:8</a>, ‘servants rule over us’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">it grieved them exceedingly</span>] Cf. the same phrase in <a href="/jonah/4-1.htm" title="But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.">Jonah 4:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that there was come a man</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">for that</span>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a man</span>] Contemptuous reference to Nehemiah. His office and position as ‘pekhah’ not referred to. The Hebrew ‘adam,’ not ‘ish,’ is used. For the difference when both occur together, cf. <a href="/psalms/49-2.htm" title="Both low and high, rich and poor, together.">Psalm 49:2</a> (‘both low and high’), <a href="/psalms/62-9.htm" title="Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.">Psalm 62:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-9.htm" title="And the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself: therefore forgive them not.">Isaiah 2:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-15.htm" title="And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:">Isaiah 5:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to seek the welfare of</span>] Literally, ‘to seek good for.’ The phrase is not common; it is the antithesis of’ to seek the hurt’ (<a href="/esther/9-2.htm" title="The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell on all people.">Esther 9:2</a>). In <a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm" title="Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech you, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.">Jeremiah 38:4</a>, ‘this man seeketh not the <span class="ital">welfare</span> of this people, but the hurt,’ the word rendered ‘welfare’ is ‘shalom’ or ‘peace,’ here it is ‘tôbh,’ the good or prosperity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sanballat</span>. According to Josephus, Sanballat was "satrap of Samaria" under the Persians, and by descent a Cuthaean ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:7, &sect; 2). He was probably included among the governors to whom Nehemiah had brought letters, and learnt the fact that "a man was come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel" by the delivery of the letters to him. The <span class="cmt_word">Horonite</span>, Born, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at one of the two Beth-horons, the upper or the lower, mentioned in Joshua (<a href="/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3, 5</a>) as belonging to Ephraim, and now under Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite</span>. It has been usual to regard Tobiah as a native chief of the Ammonites, who, after having been a page or other servant at the Persian court, had been made head of the nation. But it seems to be quite as likely that he was a servant of Sanballat's, who stood high in his favour, gave him counsel, and was perhaps his secretary (<a href="/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It grieved them exceedingly</span>. From the time that Zerub-babel rejected the co-operation of the Samaritans in the rebuilding of the temple (<a href="/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>), an enmity set in between the two peoples which continued till the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. The two capitals were too near not to be rivals; and the greater (general) prosperity of Jerusalem made Samaria the bitterer adversary. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then the king, feeling interested, asked him: For what dost thou make request? &#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to make request for or concerning a thing, like <a href="/ezra/8-23.htm">Ezra 8:23</a>; <a href="/esther/4-8.htm">Esther 4:8</a>; <a href="/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7</a>. The question shows that the king was inclined to relieve the distress of Jerusalem which had been just stated to him. "And so I prayed to the God of heaven," to ensure divine assistance in the request he was about to lay before the king. Then Nehemiah answered (<a href="/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>), "If it please the king, and if thy servant is well-pleasing before thee, (I beg) that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it." &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489;, here and <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a>, is of like meaning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489; or &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="/esther/8-5.htm">Esther 8:5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-4.htm">2 Samuel 18:4</a> : if thy servant is right in thine eyes, i.e., if he thinks rightly concerning the matter in question.
