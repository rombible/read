The king Uzziah according to <a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm" title="Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.">2 Chronicles 26:9</a> had fortified this gate with towers. We may safely identify this gate as the chief gate in the western wall of Jerusalem, and as thus corresponding to the modern Jaffa Gate, although very possibly not standing at precisely the same spot. There were two well-known valleys outside the walls of Jerusalem, (1) the ‘valley’ or ‘ravine’ (<span class="ital">gai</span>) of Hinnom or ‘the son of Hinnom,’ i.e. Gehenna, cf. <a href="/joshua/15-8.htm" title="And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2 Kings 23:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm" title="And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm" title="Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And they dwelled from Beersheba to the valley of Hinnom.">Nehemiah 11:30</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart....">Jeremiah 7:31-32</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-6.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.">Jeremiah 19:6</a>; (2) the ‘valley’ or ‘brook’ or ‘watercourse’ (<span class="ital">nakhal</span>) of Kedron. In the present verse the word for ‘valley’ is ‘<span class="ital">gai</span>,’ and this fact coupled with the general topographical description here and in <a href="/nehemiah/3-13.htm" title="The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung gate.">Nehemiah 3:13</a>, shows that ‘the valley-gate’ was the western gate leading out into the ravine of Hinnom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Recent investigations, however, have given rise to the supposition that pre-exilic Jerusalem was much smaller in circuit and that the western wall passed down the valley of the Tyropoeon. If so, ‘the valley-gate’ would be the gate opening into the Tyropoeon, which in those days was a considerable ravine but has since become almost completely choked with accumulations of ruin. According to this view the Tyropoeon is to be identified with the Valley of the Son of Hinnom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even before the dragon well</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">even towards the dragon’s well.</span> The LXX. misreading the less common word in the Hebrew for ‘dragon,’ renders <span class="greekheb">καὶ πρὸς στὸμα πηγῆς τῶν συκῶν</span>. The name is doubtless connected with some sanctuary at this fountain in prehistoric times, when ‘living water’ was associated with the worship of a deity often represented by a ‘dragon.’ Prof. Robertson Smith (<span class="ital">Religion of the Semites</span>, pp. 156, 157) calls attention to ‘the connection of <span class="ital">jinns</span> in the form of dragons or serpents with sacred or healing springs’ … ‘The river of Coele-Syria, the Orontes, was carved out, according to local tradition, by a great dragon, which disappeared in the earth at its source.’ The explanation that the well was so called ‘because some curious large watersnake or crocodile was kept in it in Nehemiah’s time’ may be disregarded as fanciful and improbable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The identification of the well is uncertain. By some it has been identified with ‘En-Rogel,’ near ‘the serpent’s stone,’ the stone of Zoheleth (<a href="/1_kings/1-9.htm" title="And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:">1 Kings 1:9</a>). But see <a href="/nehemiah/2-15.htm" title="Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.">Nehemiah 2:15</a>. By others it has been identified with ‘the fountain of Gihon’ (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm" title="The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:">1 Kings 1:33</a>). Neither of these suggestions suits the present verse, from which we gather that ‘the dragon fountain stood on the W. or S.W. wall of the city.’ If it was a spring in the Tyropoeon Valley, it has long since been choked up. ‘The rock-hewn conduit which has been found running along the bed of the Tyropoeon Valley’ (Sir Chas. Wilson’s <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, p. 113, 1889) may very well have conducted the water from such a spring. The ‘serpent,’ or Mamilla Pool, lay at the N. end of the modern Hinnom Valley (Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell. Jud.</span> v. 3. 2).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dung port</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">dung gate.</span> The A.V. probably introduced the rendering ‘port’ as an intentional variation. For ‘port’ as the old English word for ‘gate,’ compare in the Prayer-book Version <a href="/psalms/9-14.htm" title="That I may show forth all your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in your salvation.">Psalm 9:14</a>, ‘within the <span class="ital">ports</span> of the daughter of Sion.’ Shakespeare, <span class="ital">Coriolanus</span>, i. 7, ‘So let the <span class="ital">ports</span> be guarded’ (see <span class="ital">The Bible Word-Book</span>, by W. Aldis Wright).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The dung-gate was probably so called because the refuse of the town was carried out through this gate. Some scholars suppose this to be the same as ‘the gate Harsith’ or ‘gate of potsherds’ mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/19-2.htm" title="And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you,">Jeremiah 19:2</a>. It is mentioned also in <a href="/context/nehemiah/3-13.htm" title="The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung gate....">Nehemiah 3:13-14</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-31.htm" title="Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate:">Nehemiah 12:31</a>. The proposal to identify it with the modern ‘dung-gate,’ the ‘Bâb-el-Mughâribe,’ is very natural; but the similarity of the name may be misleading. We might however assume that such a gate would be near the Southern extremity of the city, or at any rate not far from the lowest depression in the neighbourhood of the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and viewed the walls</span>, &c.] ‘viewed,’ that is, ‘surveyed,’ as in Shakespeare <span class="ital">Hen.

It ordinarily means to ‘break’ or ‘burst,’ and hence some have rendered ‘and broke my way through the walls,’ and even ‘made my way over the broken fragments;’ while the LXX. has <span class="greekheb">καὶ ᾔμην συντρίβων ἐν τῷ τείχει Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>. The similar late Hebrew verb ‘sabhar,’ rendered ‘hope’ (<a href="/esther/9-1.htm" title="Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)">Esther 9:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-166.htm" title="LORD, I have hoped for your salvation, and done your commandments.">Psalm 119:166</a>), ‘wait’ (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm" title="These wait all on you; that you may give them their meat in due season.">Psalm 104:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-15.htm" title="The eyes of all wait on you; and you give them their meat in due season.">Psalm 145:15</a>), ‘tarry’ (<a href="/ruth/1-13.htm" title="Would you tarry for them till they were grown? would you stay for them from having husbands? no, my daughters; for it grieves me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.">Ruth 1:13</a>), is probably only a variant of the word which occurs here. It was the misunderstanding of this word which caused Rashi to suggest in his note on <a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm" title="And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode on.">Nehemiah 2:12</a> that the object of Nehemiah and his companions was to break down portions of the wall that remained, in order that on the next morning the Jews might the more readily assent to his proposals!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">broken down, … consumed with fire</span>] Cf. <a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm" title="And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.">Nehemiah 1:3</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/2-3.htm" title="And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?">Nehemiah 2:3</a>. It is uncertain whether the Hebrew text had ‘wall’ or ‘walls.’ The LXX. and Latin versions both have the singular (<span class="greekheb">τείχει</span>, <span class="ital">murum</span>).

These requests were also granted. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1505; in Sol 4:13; <a href="//biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>, signifies a park or orchard; it is a word of Aryan origin (in Armenian pardez, the garden round the house, in Greek &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and is explained either from the Sanscrit parta-da, a superior district, or (by Haug) from the Zend. pairi-daza, a fenced-in place. In Old-Persian it probably denoted the king's pleasure-grounds, and in our verse a royal wood or forest. Of the situation of this park nothing reliable can be ascertained. As wood for extensive buildings was to be taken from it, the sycamore forest in the low plains, which had been the property of King David (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-28.htm">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>), and became, after the overthrow of the Davidic dynasty, first a Babylonian, and then a Persian possession, may be intended.<p>(Note: Older expositors supposed a regio a Libano ad Antilibanum protensa et arboribus amoenissimus consita to be meant. In this view, indeed, they followed Sol 4:13, but incorrectly. Cler. thought it to be a tractus terrarum in Judaea, qui Paradisus regius dicebatur. Josephus speaks (Ant. viii. 7. 3) of fine gardens and ponds at Etham, seven miles south of Jerusalem, where Solomon often made pleasure excursions. Hence Ewald (Gesch. iv. p. 169, comp. iii. p. 328) thinks that the &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1505; which belonged to the king must have been Solomon's old royal park at Aetham, which in the time of Nehemiah had become a Persian domain, and that the hill town lying not far to the west of it, and now called by the Arabs Fureidis, i.e., paradisaic, may have received its Hebrew name Beth-Kerem, i.e., house of vineyards, from similar pleasure-grounds. Hereupon Bertheau grounds the further conjecture, that "the whole district from Aetham to the hill of Paradise, situate about a league east-south-east of Aetham, may from its nature have been once covered with forest; and no hesitation would be felt in connecting the name of the mountain Gebel el-Fureidis or el-Feridis (Paradise-hill - hill which rises in a Pardes) with the Pardes in question, if it could be proved that this name was already in existence in prae-Christian times." All these conjectures rest on very uncertain bases. The Dshebel Fureidis is also called the Hill of the Franks. See the description of it in Robinson's Palestine, ii. p. 392f., and Tobler, Topographie von Jerusalem, ii. pp. 565-572.)<p>&#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, to timber, to overlay, to cover with beams (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/34-11.htm">2 Chronicles 34:11</a>) the gates of the citadel which belongs to the house, i.e., to the temple. This citadel - &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, in Greek &#x392;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; - by the temple is mentioned here for the first time; for in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-19.htm">1 Chronicles 29:19</a>, the whole temple is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;. It was certainly situate on the same place where Hyrcanus I, son of Simon Maccabaeus, or the kings of the Asmonean race, built the akro'polis and called it Baris (Jos. Ant. xv. 11. 4, comp. with xviii. 4. 3). This was subsequently rebuilt by Herod when he repaired and enlarged the temple, and named Antonia, in honour of his friend Mark Antony. It was a citadel of considerable size, provided with corner towers, walls, chambers, and spacious courts, built on a north-western side of the external chambers of the temple, for the defence of that edifice, and did not extend the entire length of the north side of the present Haram, as Robinson (see Biblical Researches, p. 300) seeks to show; comp., on the other hand, Tobler, Topographic von Jerusalem, i. p. 688f., and Rosen, Haram von Jerusalem, p. 25f. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514; is coordinate with &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;: "and for the walls of the city;" the timber not being used for building the wall itself, but for the gates (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-3.htm">Nehemiah 3:3</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/3-6.htm">Nehemiah 3:6</a>). "And for the house into which I come (to dwell)." This must be Nehemiah's official residence as Pecha. For though it is not expressly stated in the present chapter that Nehemiah was appointed Pecha (governor) by Artaxerxes, yet Nehemiah himself tells us, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>, that he had been Pecha from the twentieth year of Artaxerxes. Former governors had perhaps no official residence becoming their position. By &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; the temple cannot, as older expositors thought, be intended. This request also was granted by the king, "according to the good hand of my God upon me;" comp. rem. on <a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>. </body></html>
