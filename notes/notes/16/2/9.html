According to Josephus the chief governor of Syria, Phœnicia and Samaria was Adæus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> XI. 5. 6). The statement that Nehemiah went to the various ‘governors beyond the river’ may indicate the line of his journey, of which we are told nothing. The Compiler for brevity’s sake has here condensed ‘the Memoirs of Nehemiah,’ omitting whatever was not directly connected with the purpose of his history. Nehemiah would journey to Babylon, and from Babylon probably to Hamath and Damascus, which as the most important cities in Syria would be the residences of ‘governors.’ From Damascus he either journeyed along the E. of the Jordan, crossing it at Jericho, or he crossed it by the usual fords south of the Lake of Galilee and visited Samaria on his way to Jerusalem. At Samaria there may very possibly have resided a Persian officer (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/4-2.htm" title="And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?">Nehemiah 4:2</a>). If Nehemiah took Samaria on his way to Jerusalem, this would account for his mention of Sanballat and Tobiah (<a href="/nehemiah/2-10.htm" title="When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.">Nehemiah 2:10</a>) before the mention of his arrival at Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/2-11.htm" title="So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.">Nehemiah 2:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">had sent … with me</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">had sent with me</span>.… As the king’s commissioner Nehemiah was attended by an armed retinue. These royal soldiers placed at his disposal would greatly strengthen the independence of his position at Jerusalem. Nehemiah’s progress as governor with an armed escort is in striking contrast to the similar journey of Ezra, who was ashamed to ask for military protection for his large and unarmed company. (<a href="/ezra/8-22.htm" title="For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.">Ezra 8:22</a>.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I came to the governors beyond the river</span>.
