This word has been taken to mean not a retracing of his steps, but the turn westward in his route, which would lead eventually in the direction from which he had started. After leaving the Kedron valley the journey would not be so difficult, being probably on the more level ground where the ruins had been cleared; or where less destruction had been wrought. The absence of mention of any spot on the N. or N.W. wall has caused others to suppose that Nehemiah ‘turned back,’ having seen enough, without completing his circuit of the walls. More probably we have here an instance of condensation on the part of the compiler who at this point passes at once to the return journey, without giving us sufficient material to judge whether the complete circuit of the walls was made.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the brook</span>.

Ezra had been ashamed to request a military escort from the Persian monarch (<a href="/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22</a>); but the king gave to the high dignitary called Pecha a guard of soldiers, who certainly remained with him in Jerusalem also for his protection (<a href="/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>). Besides these, there were in his retinue his brethren, i.e., either relations or fellow-countrymen, and servants, comp. <a href="/nehemiah/4-10.htm">Nehemiah 4:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-10.htm">Nehemiah 5:10</a>. That this retinue is not mentioned in the present verses, is owing to the fact that the journey itself is not further described, but only indirectly alluded to. </body></html>
