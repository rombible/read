We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I prayed to the God of heaven - Mentally and momentarily, before answering the king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-5. the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad?&#8212;It was deemed highly unbecoming to appear in the royal presence with any weeds or signs of sorrow (Es 4:2); and hence it was no wonder that the king was struck with the dejected air of his cupbearer, while that attendant, on his part, felt his agitation increased by his deep anxiety about the issue of the conversation so abruptly begun. But the piety and intense earnestness of the man immediately restored [Nehemiah] to calm self-possession and enabled him to communicate, first, the cause of his sadness (Ne 2:3), and next, the patriotic wish of his heart to be the honored instrument of reviving the ancient glory of the city of his fathers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I prayed to the God of heaven, </span> to direct my thoughts and words, and to incline the king’s heart to grant my request. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the king said unto me, for what dost thou make request?....

The king is favourable, and asks how he can render assistance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">So I prayed</span>] Literally, ‘And I prayed’. Nehemiah instantaneously turns from the great king of Persia to the King of kings. The simplicity with which Nehemiah narrates this little incident of his momentary ejaculatory prayer adds wonderfully to the vividness of the scene. For Nehemiah’s habit of recourse to prayer see ch. <a href="/nehemiah/4-4.htm" title="Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach on their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:">Nehemiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm" title="Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.">Nehemiah 4:9</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm" title="Think on me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.">Nehemiah 5:19</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm" title="For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.">Nehemiah 6:9</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/13-14.htm" title="Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.">Nehemiah 13:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not easy to parallel this act of ejaculatory prayer from the Old Testament. In the New Testament we turn to the examples of our Lord, e.g. <a href="/john/11-41.htm" title="Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.">John 11:41</a>; <a href="/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>; <a href="/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>; and St Stephen, <a href="/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The object of his prayer is doubtless for wisdom to make his request aright and for a favourable assent from the king. He could not but expect that the king would be startled by the magnitude of a request, first to nominate his cupbearer as the royal commissioner at Jerusalem, and then to empower him to rebuild its walls and defences.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?</span> Artaxerxes understood that a complaint was contained in Nehemiah's speech, and that he must have a request to make. With gracious kindliness he facilitates its utterance. <span class="cmt_word">So I prayed to the God of heaven.</span> Nehemiah was emphatically a man of prayer. In every danger, in every difficulty, still more at any crisis, prayer rose to his lips (see <a href="/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4, 9</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-14.htm">Nehemiah 13:14</a>, etc.). Sometimes, as now, the prayer was offered silently and swiftly. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With his confession of grievous transgression, Nehemiah combines the petition that the Lord would be mindful of His word declared by Moses, that if His people, whom He had scattered among the heathen for their sins, should turn to Him and keep His commandments, He would gather them from all places where He had scattered them, and bring them back to the place which He had chosen to place His name there. This word (&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;) he designates, as that which God had commanded to His servant Moses, inasmuch as it formed a part of that covenant law which was prescribed to the Israelites as their rule of life. The matter of this word is introduced by &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;: ye transgress, I will scatter; i.e., if ye transgress by revolting from me, I will scatter you among the nations, - and ye turn to me and keep my commandments (i.e., if ye turn to me and ... ), if there were of you cast out to the end of heaven (i.e., to the most distant regions where the end of heaven touches the earth), thence will I gather you, etc. &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;, pat. Niphal, with a collective meaning, cast-out ones, like <a href="/deuteronomy/30-4.htm">Deuteronomy 30:4</a>. These words are no verbal quotation, but a free summary, in which Nehemiah had <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-5</a> chiefly in view, of what God had proclaimed in the law of Moses concerning the dispersion of His people among the heathen if they sinned against Him, and of their return to the land of their fathers if they repented and turned to Him. The clause: if the cast-out ones were at the end of heaven, etc., stands verbally in <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>. The last words, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-9.htm">Nehemiah 1:9</a>, "(I will bring them) to the place which I have chosen, that my name may dwell there," are a special application of the general promise of the law to the present case. Jerusalem is meant, where the Lord caused His name to dwell in the temple; comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>. The entreaty to remember this word and to fulfil it, seems ill adapted to existing circumstances, for a portion of the people were already brought back to Jerusalem; and Nehemiah's immediate purpose was to pray, not for the return of those still sojourning among the heathen, but for the removal of the affliction and reproach resting on those who were now at Jerusalem. Still less appropriate seems the citation of the words: If ye transgress, I will scatter you among the nations. It must, however, be remembered that Nehemiah is not so much invoking the divine compassion as the righteousness and faithfulness of a covenant God, the great and terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy (<a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>). Now this, God had shown Himself to be, by fulfilling the threats of His law that He would scatter His faithless and transgressing people among the nations. Thus His fulfilment of this one side of the covenant strengthened the hope that God would also keep His other covenant word to His people who turned to Him, viz., that He would bring them again to the land of their fathers, to the place of His gracious presence. Hence the reference to the dispersion of the nation among the heathen, forms the actual substructure for the request that so much of the promise as yet remained unfulfilled might come to pass. Nehemiah, moreover, views this promise in the full depth of its import, as securing to Israel not merely an external return to their native land, but their restoration as a community, in the midst of whom the Lord had His dwelling, and manifested Himself as the defence and refuge of His people. To the re-establishment of this covenant relation very much was still wanting. Those who had returned from captivity had indeed settled in the land of their fathers; and the temple in which they might worship God with sacrifices, according to the law, was rebuilt at Jerusalem. But notwithstanding all this, Jerusalem, with its ruined walls and burned gates, was still like a city lying waste, and exposed to attacks of all kinds; while the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah were loaded with shame and contempt by their heathen neighbours. In this sense, Jerusalem was not yet restored, and the community dwelling therein not yet brought to the place where the name of the Lord dwelt. In this respect, the promise that Jahve would again manifest Himself to His repentant people as the God of the covenant was still unfulfilled, and the petition that He would gather His people to the place which He had chosen to put His name there, i.e., to manifest Himself according to His nature, as testified in His covenant (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>), quite justifiable. In <a href="/nehemiah/1-10.htm">Nehemiah 1:10</a> Nehemiah supports his petition by the words: And these (now dwelling in Judah and Jerusalem) are Thy servants and Thy people whom Thou hast redeemed, etc. His servants who worship Him in His temple, His people whom He has redeemed from Egypt by His great power and by His strong arm, God cannot leave in affliction and reproach. The words: "redeemed with great power" ... are reminiscences from <a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-29.htm">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>, and other passages in the Pentateuch, and refer to the deliverance from Egypt.</body></html>
