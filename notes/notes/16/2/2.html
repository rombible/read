His fear sprang from the king’s abrupt inquiry. A sad countenance was never tolerated in the royal presence; and, though Artaxerxes was of a milder character than any other Persian monarch, the tone of his question showed that in this respect he was not an exception.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/nehemiah/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.

We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I was very sore afraid - A Persian subject was expected to be perfectly content so long as he had the happiness of being with his king.

But the piety and intense earnestness of the man immediately restored [Nehemiah] to calm self-possession and enabled him to communicate, first, the cause of his sadness (Ne 2:3), and next, the patriotic wish of his heart to be the honored instrument of reviving the ancient glory of the city of his fathers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Why is thy countenance sad?</span> his fasting joined with inward grief had made a sensible change in his very countenance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I was very sore afraid; </span> partly, being daunted by the majesty of the king, and the suddenness and sharpness of his question; partly, fearing lest there was arising some jealousy or ill opinion in the king concerning him; partly, because it was an unusual and ungrateful thing to come into the king of Persia’s presence with any badges or tokens of sorrow, <span class="bld"><a href="/esther/4-2.htm" title="And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.">Esther 4:2</a></span>; and principally, from his doubts or fears of disappointment, because his request was great and invidious, and odious to the most of the Persian courtiers, and might be represented as dangerous, and might seem improper for a time of feasting and jollity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore the king said unto me, why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick?....

Their destiny and perhaps his own life depended upon his success. The capricious temper of Persian kings was well known.

History puts him before us as a weak monarch, one who could compromise the royal dignity by making terms with a revolted subject, while he disgraced it by breaking faith with a conquered enemy. But if weak as a king, as a man he was kind-hearted and gentle. Few Persian monarchs would have been sufficiently interested in their attendants to notice whether they were sad or no; fewer still would have shown sympathy on such an occasion. A Xerxes might have ordered the culprit to instant execution. Longimanus feels compassion, and wishes to assuage the grief of his servant. <span class="cmt_word">Then I was very sore afraid</span>. Notwithstanding the king's kind and compassionate words, Nehemiah feels his danger. He has looked sad in the king's presence. He is about to ask permission to quit the court. These are both sins against the fundamental doctrine of Persian court life, that to bask in the light of the royal countenance is the height of felicity. Will the king be displeased, refuse his request, dismiss him from his post, cast him into prison, or will he pardon his rudeness and allow his request? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>We have dealt very corruptly against Thee. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500; is the inf. constr. instead of the infin. abs., which, before the finite verb, and by reason of its close connection therewith, becomes the infin. constr., like &#1488;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/psalms/50-21.htm">Psalm 50:21</a>; comp.
