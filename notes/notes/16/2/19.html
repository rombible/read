In <a href="/nehemiah/6-6.htm" title="Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu said it, that you and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause you build the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words.">Nehemiah 6:6</a>, the name is written as ‘Gashmu,’ a dialectical variety agreeing, as it is said, with North-Arabian usage. Geshem is clearly the chief of some Arabian tribe. But whether he represented Arabians on the Southern border of Judah or the Arabian community established by Sargon king of Assyria in the depopulated neighbourhood of Samaria (715) is a disputed point. If the former, then the movement, which he now took part in, must be regarded as a coalition of all the neighbouring peoples against the restoration of Jerusalem’s greatness. If the latter, then the movement is to be chiefly connected with the hostility of the Samaritans.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Arabian</span>] See on <a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm" title="But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,">Nehemiah 4:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">laughed us to scorn</span>] A strong word, familiar to us from its occurrence in the Psalter (<a href="/psalms/2-4.htm" title="He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.">Psalm 2:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm" title="All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,">Psalm 22:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/59-8.htm" title="But you, O LORD, shall laugh at them; you shall have all the heathen in derision.">Psalm 59:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/80-6.htm" title="You make us a strife to our neighbors: and our enemies laugh among themselves.">Psalm 80:6</a>).

The ground of the contempt here expressed is not quite obvious. Some suppose that the enemy scoffed in ignorance of the king’s decree in favour of Nehemiah’s action, and that, regarding the Jews as embarking upon a course of open rebellion, they derided an undertaking which they thought could have but one conclusion. On the other hand, it is hardly likely that Nehemiah would have kept in the background the royal authority for his undertaking. We know he had been to the ‘governors’ of the province (<a href="/nehemiah/2-9.htm" title="Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.">Nehemiah 2:9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is more probable that in order to alienate the Persian officials and to frighten the more timid spirits among the Jews, they pretended to interpret Nehemiah’s action as the first step towards a real rebellion. The insignificance of the Jewish community in size and strength—its inability to take any political step of real importance—presented an easy target for ridicule, which was calculated to arouse the suspicions of Persian officials at the same time that it promoted disaffection amongst the waverers in Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">will ye rebel</span>] Or ‘are ye rebelling?’ Vulg. <span class="ital">Numquid contra regem vos rebellatis?</span> LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀποστατεῖτε</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Geshem the Arabian</span>, elsewhere called Gashmu (<a href="/nehemiah/6-6.htm">Nehemiah 6:6</a>), may have been an independent sheikh possessing authority in Idumea, or in the desert country adjoining upon Ammon; but it seems quite as likely that he was merely the head of a body of Arab troops maintained by Sanballat at Samaria (<a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7</a>). Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem are united so closely, and act so much together (<a href="/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1, 2, 6, 12, 14</a>), that it is difficult to suppose them to be three chieftains residing on three sides of Judaea, the north, the east, and the south, merely holding diplomatic intercourse with each other, which is the ordinary idea. Note that Tobiah is present with Sanballat in Samaria on one occasion (<a href="/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>), and that Geshem and Sanballat propose a joint interview with Nehemiah on another (<a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They laughed us to scorn, and said</span>.

The dragon-well only occurs here by this name. Judging from its position between the valley-gate and the dung-gate, it is either identical with the well of Gihon (Robinson, Palestine, ii. p. 166), whose waters supply the upper and lower pools in the valley of Gihon, the present Birket el Mamilla and Birket es Sultan, or situate in its immediate neighbourhood. The valley-gate is the modern gate of the city leading to the valley of Gihon, and situated at or near the present Jaffa gate; see rem. on <a href="/nehemiah/3-13.htm">Nehemiah 3:13</a>. The dung-gate (&#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;), which in <a href="/nehemiah/3-13.htm">Nehemiah 3:13</a> also is placed next the valley-gate, and was a thousand cubits distant therefrom, must be sought for on the south-western side of Zion, where a road, to the south of Nebi Dd and the Zion gate, now descends into the valley of Hinnom, towards Sr Baher. "And I viewed the walls of Jerusalem which lay broken down, and its gates which were consumed by fire." The word &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, which the lxx read, "I was breaking down," gives no tolerable sense; for it cannot mean, I broke through the walls, or, I made a path through the ruins. Many MSS, however, and several editions, offer &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1512;; and R. Norzi informs us that D. Kimchi and Aben Ezra read &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;. &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1512;, of which only the Piel occurs in Hebrew, answers to the Aramaean &#1505;&#1489;&#1512;, to look to something; and to the Arabic sbr, to investigate; and &#1489; &#1505;&#1489;&#1512; means to look on, to consider, to direct the eyes and thoughts to some object.
