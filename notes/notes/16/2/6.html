We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The queen - Though the Persian kings practiced polygamy, they always had one chief wife, who alone was recognized as "queen."

The queen referred to was probably Esther, whose presence would tend greatly to embolden Nehemiah in stating his request; and through her influence, powerfully exerted it may be supposed, also by her sympathy with the patriotic design, his petition was granted, to go as deputy governor of Judea, accompanied by a military guard, and invested with full powers to obtain materials for the building in Jerusalem, as well as to get all requisite aid in promoting his enterprise.<p>I set him a time&#8212;Considering the great despatch made in raising the walls, it is probable that this leave of absence was limited at first to a year or six months, after which he returned to his duties in Shushan. The circumstance of fixing a set time for his return, as well as entrusting so important a work as the refortification of Jerusalem to his care, proves the high favor and confidence Nehemiah enjoyed at the Persian court, and the great estimation in which his services were held. At a later period he received a new commission for the better settlement of the affairs of Judea and remained governor of that province for twelve years (Ne 5:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The queen also sitting by him; </span> which is here noted, partly as an unusual thing; for commonly the kings of Persia dined alone, and their queens seldom dined with them, as historians note; and peradventure because the queen expressed some kindness to him, and promoted his request with the king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When wilt thou return?</span> this question showed the king’s respect and affection to him, and that he was not willing to want his attendance longer than was necessary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I set him a time; </span> either that twelve years mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm" title="Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.">Nehemiah 5:14</a> 13:6</span>, or rather a far shorter time; for which cause, among others, he built the walls with such despatch, even in fifty-two days, <span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm" title="So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.">Nehemiah 6:15</a></span>; and probably not very long after that returned to the king, by whom he was sent a second time with more ample commission, and for the king’s service, and the government of that part of his dominions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said unto me, the queen also sitting by him,....

The account is very condensed. Nehemiah’s request is favourably received, but only the general results of the conversation are related. The king seems at once to have appointed Nehemiah to be ‘governor’ at Jerusalem (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm" title="Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.">Nehemiah 5:14</a>), and to have approved the policy of restoring the walls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the queen</span>] The royal consort (cf. <a href="/psalms/45-10.htm" title="Listen, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people, and your father's house;">Psalm 45:10</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/5-2.htm" title="Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein....">Daniel 5:2-3</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-23.htm" title="But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:">Daniel 5:23</a>) the head of the Harem.

Mus.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and I set him a time</span>] The duration of this period is not stated. And the length of Nehemiah’s first residence in Jerusalem has been much disputed, some holding that he returned to the king’s court immediately after the completion of the walls, others saying that he remained as governor (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm" title="Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.">Nehemiah 5:14</a>) for twelve years, having obtained an extension of the time of absence originally agreed upon.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The queen</span>. It appears from Ctesias ('Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 44) that Artaxerxes Longimanus had but one legitimate wife - a certain Damaspia. Nothing more is known of her besides this mention, and the fact that she died on the same day as her husband. (The Septuagint rendering of <span class="accented">hashegal</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> is wrong.) <span class="cmt_word">Sitting by him</span>. Not an unusual circumstance. Though, when the monarch entertained guests, the queen remained in her private apartments (<a href="/esther/1-9.htm">Esther 1:9-12</a>), yet on other occasions she frequently took her meals with him ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 214). <span class="cmt_word">I set him a time</span>. Nehemiah probably mentioned some such time as a year, or two years - such a space as would suffice for the double journey, and the restoration of the fortifications. He stayed away, however, as he tells us (<a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>), twelve years, obtaining no doubt from time to time an extension of his leave (Bertheau). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prayer closes with the reiterated entreaty that God would hearken to the prayer of His servant (i.e., Nehemiah), and to the prayer of His servants who delight to fear His name (&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, infin. like <a href="/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a> and elsewhere), i.e., of all Israelites who, like Nehemiah, prayed to God to redeem Israel from all his troubles. For himself in particular, Nehemiah also request: "Prosper Thy servant to-day (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; like <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6</a>; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1498; may be either the accusative of the person, like <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>, or the dative: Prosper his design unto Thy servant, like <a href="/nehemiah/2-20.htm">Nehemiah 2:20</a>), and give him to mercy (i.e., cause him to find mercy; comp. <a href="/1_kings/8-50.htm">1 Kings 8:50</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-46.htm">Psalm 106:46</a>) before the face of this man." What man he means is explained by the following supplementary remark, "And I was cup-bearer to the king," without whose favour and permission Nehemiah could not have carried his project into execution (as related in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/2.htm">Nehemiah 2</a>). </body></html>
