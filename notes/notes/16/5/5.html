The People Complain of Their Debt, Mortgage, and Bondage.<p>1-5. there was a great cry of the people &#8230; against their brethren&#8212;Such a crisis in the condition of the Jews in Jerusalem&#8212;fatigued with hard labor and harassed by the machinations of restless enemies, the majority of them poor, and the bright visions which hope had painted of pure happiness on their return to the land of their fathers being unrealized&#8212;must have been very trying to their faith and patience. But, in addition to these vexatious oppressions, many began to sink under a new and more grievous evil. The poor made loud complaints against the rich for taking advantage of their necessities, and grinding them by usurious exactions. Many of them had, in consequence of these oppressions, been driven to such extremities that they had to mortgage their lands and houses to enable them to pay the taxes to the Persian government, and ultimately even to sell their children for slaves to procure the means of subsistence. The condition of the poorer inhabitants was indeed deplorable; for, besides the deficient harvests caused by the great rains (Ezr 10:9; also Hag 1:6-11), a dearth was now threatened by the enemy keeping such a multitude pent up in the city, and preventing the country people bringing in provisions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren; </span> we are of the same nature, and nation, and religion with them although they treat us as if we were beasts or heathens, forgetting both humanity and God’s law, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:">Deu 15:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We bring into bondage; </span> we are compelled to sell them for our subsistence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Our sons and our daughters; </span> which was an evidence of their great necessity, because their daughters were more tender, and weak, and unfit for bond-service, and more exposed to injuries, than their sons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither is it in our power to redeem them; </span> which we are allowed to do, <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/21-7.htm" title="And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.">Exodus 21:7</a></span>, but have not wherewith to do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren,....

It was not contrary to law or custom. The complaint is that the distress arises from public causes, and that the rich creditors make an unfair use of the common crisis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Israelite laws upon this subject are not in perfect agreement. The earliest code of law contemplates the case of a Hebrew selling himself to be a ‘bondman;’ but he is to be released in the 7th year of his service. The special case of a man selling his daughter as a ‘bondwoman’ is dealt with and certain benevolent conditions imposed (<a href="/context/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing....">Exodus 21:2-6</a>). The Deuteronomic law (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/15-12.htm" title="And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you....">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>) is in close agreement with this; it enjoins release to take place in the 7th year, and extends the favourable terms granted in Exodus to the ‘female bondservant’ so that they should be applicable also to the male.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Priestly Law (<a href="/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:...">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>) forbids any Israelite to be made ‘a bondservant.’ There is no mention of release in the 7th year of service; but a general release is to be granted in the year of jubile (<a href="/leviticus/25-41.htm" title="And then shall he depart from you, both he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers shall he return.">Leviticus 25:41</a>). The Priestly Law contemplates a less rigorous degree of service, but is less favourable than are the other codes in the matter of release.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The present passage does not recognize the distinction between ‘the bondservant’ and ‘the hired servant.’ It assumes the condition of things permitted by the law of Ex. and Deut., which is also illustrated by <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm" title="The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="/amos/8-6.htm" title="That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?">Amos 8:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-25.htm" title="But for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.">Matthew 18:25</a>. The grievance is not so much that children are sold as slaves to Jewish creditors, as that the parents are compelled to resort to this extreme measure in order to pay the high interest exacted by usurers who were their own countrymen. That the extortion and not the slavery is the offence which excited the popular indignation is shown by the measures of relief recommended by Nehemiah in <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm" title="Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.">Nehemiah 5:11</a>. The slavery of countrymen was unworthy of the people, but was not an offence against the Law (see <a href="/nehemiah/5-8.htm" title="And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.">Nehemiah 5:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither</span> is it <span class="ital">in our power</span>] The Hebrew idiom here is not common and deserves notice. The literal rendering of the words is sometimes thought to be ‘and our hand is not for (<span class="ital">or</span> to) God (Êl),’ ‘our hand is not in the place of God, our strength is but human.’ But it is more probable that we ought to render ‘and it is not for (i.e. within the measure of) the strength of our hand,’ the word ‘Êl’ not being used as a Divine title. For other instances of this idiom see <a href="/genesis/31-29.htm" title="It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.">Genesis 31:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-32.htm" title="Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in your hand.">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm" title="Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.">Proverbs 3:27</a>; <a href="/micah/2-1.htm" title="Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil on their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.">Micah 2:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>to redeem them] R.V. <span class="bld">to help it.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for other men</span>, &c.] A general statement, describing the result which seemed inevitable. The poor Jews mortgaged their property. The interest on the mortgages was so high that they could not pay it or were compelled to sell their children into bondage. At this rate it would not be long before the mortgages were all foreclosed, and the property had passed into the hands of ‘other’ men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is clear that the Jews at this time either were not acquainted with the Priestly Law enacting the reversion of property in the ‘jubile’ year (<a href="/context/leviticus/25-25.htm" title="If your brother be waxen poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold....">Leviticus 25:25-28</a>) or regarded it as a Utopian measure incapable of application to the actual needs of society.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren</span>.

The abstracts, guardianship and labour, stand for the concretes, guards and labourers. As &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, to us, refers to the whole community separated on the walls, so is &#1493;&#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; to be understood of all the workers, and not of the fighting men only. From &#1493;&#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; it only appears that the fathers of families and master builders had servants with them as labourers.</body></html>
