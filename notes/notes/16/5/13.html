The right way to reform men's lives, is to convince their consciences. If you walk in the fear of God, you will not be either covetous of worldly gain, or cruel toward your brethren. Nothing exposes religion more to reproach, than the worldliness and hard-heartedness of the professors of it. Those that rigorously insist upon their right, with a very ill grace try to persuade others to give up theirs. In reasoning with selfish people, it is good to contrast their conduct with that of others who are liberal; but it is best to point to His example, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we, through his poverty, might be rich, 2Co 8:9.

I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words&#8212;When such disorders came to the knowledge of the governor, his honest indignation was roused against the perpetrators of the evil. Having summoned a public assembly, he denounced their conduct in terms of just severity. He contrasted it with his own in redeeming with his money some of the Jewish exiles who, through debt or otherwise, had lost their personal liberty in Babylon. He urged the rich creditors not only to abandon their illegal and oppressive system of usury, but to restore the fields and vineyards of the poor, so that a remedy might be put to an evil the introduction of which had led to much actual disorder, and the continuance of which would inevitably prove ruinous to the newly restored colony, by violating the fundamental principles of the Hebrew constitution. The remonstrance was effectual. The conscience of the usurious oppressors could not resist the touching and powerful appeal. With mingled emotions of shame, contrition, and fear, they with one voice expressed their readiness to comply with the governor's recommendation. The proceedings were closed by the parties binding themselves by a solemn oath, administered by the priests, that they would redeem their pledge, as well as by the governor invoking, by the solemn and significant gesture of shaking a corner of his garment, a malediction on those who should violate it.

He pressed tightly to his body the loose fold of his mantle, so that it hung like a bag or wallet against him; then with a vehement motion of both hands he suddenly stretched it out and shook it in the sight of all the people, so that anything which it might have before concealed would have been jerked violently from him. Even so, he says, may God cast forth from His protection and love, in home and work, the man who fails to abide by the compact.

Even the taking of the oath did not seem sufficient to the prudent governor. He would strengthen the oath by a malediction, and a malediction accompanied by a symbolical act, to render it the more impressive. Among the nations of antiquity few things were so much dreaded as falling under a curse. The maledictions of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-16.htm">Deuteronomy 28:16-44</a> were the supreme sanction which Moses devised for the Law, whereof he was the promulgator. Curses protected the tombs and inscriptions of the Assyrian and Persian kings, the contracts of the Babylonians, and the treaties of most nations. Nehemiah's curse is an unusual one, but very clear and intelligible. He prays that whosoever departs from his promise given may be cast forth a homeless wanderer, emptied of all his possessions, as empty as the fold in his own dress, which he first gathers into a sort of bag or pocket, and then throws from him and so empties out. To this the assembly responded by a hearty "Amen," and then <span class="cmt_word">praised the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord</span> for the happy ending of the whole affair; in which they piously traced the directing and over-ruling hand of God, "restraining the fierceness of men," and "turning it to his praise" (<a href="/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a> - Prayer-Book version). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 5:14-19 GENERAL ACCOUNT OF NEHEMIAH'S GOVERNMENT (vers. 14-19). Having given this account of the internal difficulties which threatened to put a stop to the building of the wall before it was well begun, and been led in the course of it to speak of the poverty and sufferings of the common people, Nehemiah not unnaturally goes on to inform us of the methods by which in his general government he endeavoured to alleviate the distress, or at any rate to avoid adding to the burthens which pressed upon the poorer classes. From the time that he entered upon his office, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes,  <span class="date">B.C. 444</span>, to the time of his writing this portion of his Book, in the thirty-second year of the same king,  <span class="date">B.C. 432</span>, he had lived entirely at his own expense, requiring no contributions from the people, either in provisions or money, for the support of himself or his court (ver. 14). This was quite contrary to the previous practice of Jewish governors (ver. 15), and indeed of Oriental governors generally, whether under the Persian system or any other, such persons almost universally taxing their provinces, sometimes very heavily, for their current expenses, and often accumulating princely fortunes by their exactions. Nehemiah had also maintained a noble hospitality, of which he may be excused for being a little proud, during these twelve years of his governorship, entertaining daily at his table 150 of the chief inhabitants of Jerusalem, besides many foreign Jews who from time to time came on visits to the Judaean capital (vers. 17, 18). It is conjectured that he was able to take this course, and spend so largely without receiving any income from his province, because he retained his place of cupbearer, and as such drew a large salary from the Persian court (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 150, E. Tr.). However this may have been, he certainly disbursed large sums of money in Jerusalem, and must have done something to alleviate the general poverty by his lavish expenditure. He takes credit, further, for giving the services of his private attendants to the work of the wall during the whole time that it was in building (ver. 16), and for having abstained from the purchase of any land, when, through the general poverty, it might have been bought at a low price from those who were anxious to part with it (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). HIS conduct beyond a doubt stood in the strongest contrast with that of the ordinary Persian satrap, or other governor, and we cannot be surprised that he looked on it with some complacency. He felt that he had done much for his people. He looked, however, for his reward not to them, not to man, but to God; and desired that his reward should be not present gratitude and thanks, not even posthumous fame, but God's approval and remembrance only (ver. 19). "Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And my heart took counsel upon it (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; according to the Chaldee use of &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, <a href="/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a>), and I contended with the nobles and rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury every one of his brother." &#1489; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; means to lend to any one, and &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;, also &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-26.htm">Proverbs 22:26</a>, and mashe', is the thing lent, the loan, what one borrows from or lends to another. Consequently &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; is to lend some one a loan; comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>. This does not seem to suit this verse. For Nehemiah cannot reproach the nobles for lending loans, when he and his servants had, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-10.htm">Nehemiah 5:10</a>, done so likewise. Hence the injustice of the transaction which he rebukes must be expressed in the emphatic precedence given to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;. Bertheau accordingly regards &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488; not as the accusative of the object, but as an independent secondary accusative in the sense of: for the sake of demanding a pledge, ye lend. But this rendering can be neither grammatically nor lexically justified. In the first respect it is opposed by &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>, which shows that &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488; in conjunction with &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; is the accusative of the object; in the other, by the constant use of &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488; in all passages in which it occurs to express a loan, not a demand for a pledge. From <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>, where it is said, "If thou lend money (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;) to the poor, thou shalt not be to him &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, shalt not lay upon him usury," it is evident that &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is one who lends money on usury, or carries on the business of a money-lender. This evil secondary meaning of the word is here strongly marked by the emphatic praeposition of &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;; hence Nehemiah is speaking of those who practise usury. "And I appointed a great assembly on their account," to put a stop to the usury and injustice by a public discussion of the matter. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, not against them (the usurers), but on their account.</body></html>
