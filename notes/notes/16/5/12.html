The right way to reform men's lives, is to convince their consciences. If you walk in the fear of God, you will not be either covetous of worldly gain, or cruel toward your brethren. Nothing exposes religion more to reproach, than the worldliness and hard-heartedness of the professors of it. Those that rigorously insist upon their right, with a very ill grace try to persuade others to give up theirs. In reasoning with selfish people, it is good to contrast their conduct with that of others who are liberal; but it is best to point to His example, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we, through his poverty, might be rich, 2Co 8:9.

The Usurers Rebuked.<p>6-12. I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words&#8212;When such disorders came to the knowledge of the governor, his honest indignation was roused against the perpetrators of the evil. Having summoned a public assembly, he denounced their conduct in terms of just severity. He contrasted it with his own in redeeming with his money some of the Jewish exiles who, through debt or otherwise, had lost their personal liberty in Babylon. He urged the rich creditors not only to abandon their illegal and oppressive system of usury, but to restore the fields and vineyards of the poor, so that a remedy might be put to an evil the introduction of which had led to much actual disorder, and the continuance of which would inevitably prove ruinous to the newly restored colony, by violating the fundamental principles of the Hebrew constitution. The remonstrance was effectual. The conscience of the usurious oppressors could not resist the touching and powerful appeal. With mingled emotions of shame, contrition, and fear, they with one voice expressed their readiness to comply with the governor's recommendation. The proceedings were closed by the parties binding themselves by a solemn oath, administered by the priests, that they would redeem their pledge, as well as by the governor invoking, by the solemn and significant gesture of shaking a corner of his garment, a malediction on those who should violate it. The historian has taken care to record that the people did according to this promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We will restore them, </span> to wit, the lands and houses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Will require nothing of them, </span> for the hundredth part. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I called the priests; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

He summoned the priests to administer the oath. Thus the engagement was undertaken in the presence of public witnesses. The presence of the priests added to the solemnity of the transaction, and was of additional importance, since the priests were entrusted with judicial functions and would have to decide questions between debtor and creditor. On the judicial functions of the priests and their duties outside the Temple cf. <a href="/nehemiah/11-16.htm" title="And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.">Nehemiah 11:16</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-4.htm" title="Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:">1 Chronicles 23:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-29.htm" title="Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.">1 Chronicles 26:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">took an oath of them</span>] ‘Them’ refers not to the priests, but to the money-lenders.
