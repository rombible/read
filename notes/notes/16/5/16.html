Let all who are in public places remember that they are so placed to do good, not to enrich themselves. Nehemiah mentions it to God in prayer, not as if he had merited any favour from God, but to show that he depended upon God only, to make up to him what he had lost and laid out for his honour. Nehemiah evidently spake and acted as one that knew himself to be a sinner. He did not mean to claim a reward as of debt, but in the manner that the Lord rewards a cup of cold water given to a disciple for his sake. The fear and love of God in the heart, and true love of the brethren, will lead to every good work. These are proper evidences of justifying faith; and our reconciled God will look upon persons of this character for good, according to all they have done for his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I continued ... land - i. e. - "I took my share in the work of the wall, as general superintendent.

It does not appear certain whether Nehemiah here refers to his continuous supervision of the building or to his personal share in the work of restoration at his own cost of some portion of it. The word rendered ‘continued’ (used in its literal sense of ‘held’ in <a href="/nehemiah/4-16.htm" title="And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants worked in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.">Nehemiah 4:16</a>) admits of either application.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither bought we any land</span>] In connexion with the previous and the following clauses, these words should be taken to mean that Nehemiah and his friends were too strenuously occupied to interest themselves in the purchase of lands. Former governors had possibly made investments in good land. Such transactions were incompatible with Nehemiah’s ceaseless devotion to the work. But it is necessary also to regard the words as an allusion to the substance of <a href="/nehemiah/5-10.htm" title="I likewise, and my brothers, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.">Nehemiah 5:10</a>. Although they had abundant opportunity to make private gain out of mortgaged property, they withstood the temptation of enriching themselves out of their fellow-countrymen. The word ‘land’ is the same as that which in the Plur. the R.V. has altered to ‘fields’ in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/nehemiah/5-3.htm" title="Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth....">Nehemiah 5:3-5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm" title="Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them.">Nehemiah 5:11</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all my servants were gathered</span>] Their work at the wall and in Nehemiah’s employ was too incessant to permit of the inspection of purchaseable land or of its proper cultivation if they had purchased it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I continued in the work of this wall</span>. Literally, "I <span class="accented">repaired</span>," like the others (<a href="/nehemiah/3-4.htm">Nehemiah 3:4-31</a>). I employed myself not in buying up men's fields at low prices, and so enriching myself, but in the restoring and repairing of the wall, over which I exercised a constant superintendence. <span class="cmt_word">All my servants were gathered thither</span>. See <a href="/nehemiah/4-16.htm">Nehemiah 4:16</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I, likewise my brethren and my servants (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17</a>), have lent them money and corn; let us, I pray, remit (not ask back) this loan!" The participle &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; says: we are those who have lent. Herewith he connects the invitation, <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a> : "Restore unto them, I pray you, even this day (&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, about this day, i.e., even to-day, <a href="/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>), their fields, their vineyards, their olive gardens, and their houses, and the hundredth of the money, and of the corn, wine, and oil which you have lent them." Nehemiah requires, 1st, that those who held the lands of their poorer brethren in pledge should restore them their property without delay: 2nd, that they should remit to their debtors all interest owing on money, corn, etc. that had been lent; not, as the words have been frequently understood, that they should give back to their debtors such interest as they had already received. That the words in <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a> bear the former, and not the latter signification, is obvious from the reply, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-12.htm">Nehemiah 5:12</a>, of those addressed: "We will restore, sc. their lands, etc., and will not querie of them, sc. the hundredth; so will we do as thou sayest." Hence we must not translate &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "which you had taken from them as interest" (de Wette), - a translation which, moreover, cannot be justified by the usage of the language, for &#1489; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; does not mean to take interest from another, to lend to another on interest. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; relates not to &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, but to &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512; ... &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1503;; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to restore, to make good, is used of both the transactions in question, meaning in the first clause the restoration of the lands retained as pledges, and in the second, the remission (the non-requirement) of the hundredth. The hundredth taken as interest is probably, like the centesima of the Romans, to be understood of a monthly payment. One per cent. per month was a very heavy interest, and one which, in the case of the poor, might be exorbitant. The law, moreover, forbade the taking of any usury from their brethren, their poor fellow-countrymen, <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a> and <a href="/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36</a>. When the creditors had given the consent required, Nehemiah called the priests, and made them (the creditors) swear to do according to this promise, i.e., conscientiously to adhere to their agreement. Nehemiah obtained the attendance of the priests, partly for the purpose of giving solemnity to the oath now taken, and partly to give to the declaration made in the presence of the priests legal validity for judicial decisions.</body></html>
