or that he did not continue at Jerusalem for the whole twelve years together; or that, if he did, he did not keep up this expensive way of living all the time, but only during the great and present exigencies of the Jews, which ceased in a good measure after the walls were built, the act against usury passed, and the people discharged to their ordinary course of maintaining themselves and families.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:14-19 Those who truly fear God, will not dare to do any thing cruel or unjust. Let all who are in public places remember that they are so placed to do good, not to enrich themselves. Nehemiah mentions it to God in prayer, not as if he had merited any favour from God, but to show that he depended upon God only, to make up to him what he had lost and laid out for his honour. Nehemiah evidently spake and acted as one that knew himself to be a sinner. He did not mean to claim a reward as of debt, but in the manner that the Lord rewards a cup of cold water given to a disciple for his sake. The fear and love of God in the heart, and true love of the brethren, will lead to every good work. These are proper evidences of justifying faith; and our reconciled God will look upon persons of this character for good, according to all they have done for his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the far grander provision for Solomon's table (see the marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

From this great and daily expense, it seems more than probable that Nehemiah did not continue here for twelve years together, as some would think, or at least that he did not this all that time, but only during the great and present exigencies and distresses of the Jews, which ceased in good part after the walls were built, and the hearts of all the Jews revived, and their enemies dispirited thereby. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep,....

The word in the Hebrew is used of men chosen for a purpose, <a href="/1_chronicles/7-40.htm" title="All these were the children of Asher, heads of their father's house, choice and mighty men of valor, chief of the princes.

The specification of 10 days and the preposition before ‘sorts of wine’ lead us to expect the mention of some particular quantity. The conjecture is possible that this was originally expressed by a word denoting a measure, unfamiliar to later copyists, who substituted a general expression for the word. According to the present text, fresh supplies of wine were furnished every ten days, i.e. thrice a month. LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν οἶνος τῷ πλήθει</span>. Vulg. ‘Vina diversa et multa alia tribuebam.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yet for</span> all <span class="ital">this</span>] Lit. ‘with this,’ i.e. ‘in spite of this heavy outlay.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">required not I</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">I demanded not.</span> The sense is ‘I did not demand my rights.’ At the time of the A.V. translation ‘to require’ was equivalent to ‘to ask,’ in which sense the A.V. employs it here; see <a href="/ezra/8-22.htm" title="For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.">Ezra 8:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-16.htm" title="For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.">Psalm 38:16</a> (P.B.V.) ‘I have required that they, even mine enemies, should not triumph over me.’ The usage of ‘require’ for ‘demanding by authority,’ ‘making requisition for’ (see Wright, <span class="ital">Bible Word-Book</span>) is more modern. But inasmuch as ‘I did not require’ could now be understood to mean ‘I did not need,’ the change to the less equivocal ‘demand’ is a gain in clearness and accuracy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the bread of the governor</span>] See <a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm" title="Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.">Nehemiah 5:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the bondage was heavy</span>, &c.] i.e. the tribute exacted from the Jews by the Persian Imperial government. The word rendered ‘bondage’ occurs twice elsewhere in this book, <a href="/nehemiah/3-5.htm" title="And next to them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their LORD.">Nehemiah 3:5</a>, ‘the work of their lord,’ <a href="/nehemiah/10-37.htm" title="And that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.">Nehemiah 10:37</a>, ‘cities of our tillage.’ Used of oppressive ‘service’ it is familiar to us in Exodus (<a href="/exodus/1-14.htm" title="And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.">Exodus 1:14</a>, (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the bondage.">Exodus 2:23</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/5-9.htm" title="Also I said, It is not good that you do: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?">Nehemiah 5:9</a>, &c.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Once in ten clays store of all sorts of wine</span>.

Or, "<span class="accented">with</span> all this"- notwithstanding this great expenditure, I took no allowance as governor. <span class="cmt_word">Because the bondage was heavy upon this people</span>. The bondage intended must be that under the Persian crown, since neither the labour at the wall nor the oppression of the creditors lasted during the twelve years that Nehemiah was governor. It would seem that the tribute, already complained of in ver. 4, must have been felt as a heavy burthen at this period. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I, likewise my brethren and my servants (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17</a>), have lent them money and corn; let us, I pray, remit (not ask back) this loan!" The participle &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; says: we are those who have lent. Herewith he connects the invitation, <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a> : "Restore unto them, I pray you, even this day (&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, about this day, i.e., even to-day, <a href="/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>), their fields, their vineyards, their olive gardens, and their houses, and the hundredth of the money, and of the corn, wine, and oil which you have lent them." Nehemiah requires, 1st, that those who held the lands of their poorer brethren in pledge should restore them their property without delay: 2nd, that they should remit to their debtors all interest owing on money, corn, etc. that had been lent; not, as the words have been frequently understood, that they should give back to their debtors such interest as they had already received. That the words in <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a> bear the former, and not the latter signification, is obvious from the reply, <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-12.htm">Nehemiah 5:12</a>, of those addressed: "We will restore, sc. their lands, etc., and will not querie of them, sc. the hundredth; so will we do as thou sayest." Hence we must not translate &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "which you had taken from them as interest" (de Wette), - a translation which, moreover, cannot be justified by the usage of the language, for &#1489; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; does not mean to take interest from another, to lend to another on interest. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; relates not to &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, but to &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512; ... &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1503;; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to restore, to make good, is used of both the transactions in question, meaning in the first clause the restoration of the lands retained as pledges, and in the second, the remission (the non-requirement) of the hundredth. The hundredth taken as interest is probably, like the centesima of the Romans, to be understood of a monthly payment. One per cent. per month was a very heavy interest, and one which, in the case of the poor, might be exorbitant. The law, moreover, forbade the taking of any usury from their brethren, their poor fellow-countrymen, <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a> and <a href="/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36</a>. When the creditors had given the consent required, Nehemiah called the priests, and made them (the creditors) swear to do according to this promise, i.e., conscientiously to adhere to their agreement. Nehemiah obtained the attendance of the priests, partly for the purpose of giving solemnity to the oath now taken, and partly to give to the declaration made in the presence of the priests legal validity for judicial decisions.</body></html>
