The matter was complicated, as the transgressors had violated rather the spirit than the letter of the law. Hence the rebuke, that they exacted usury each of his brother, failed in its object; and the governor called a general assembly, not “against them,” but “concerning them.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-13 Nehemiah knew that, if he built Jerusalem's walls ever so high, so thick, or so strong, the city could not be safe while there were abuses. The right way to reform men's lives, is to convince their consciences. If you walk in the fear of God, you will not be either covetous of worldly gain, or cruel toward your brethren. Nothing exposes religion more to reproach, than the worldliness and hard-heartedness of the professors of it. Those that rigorously insist upon their right, with a very ill grace try to persuade others to give up theirs. In reasoning with selfish people, it is good to contrast their conduct with that of others who are liberal; but it is best to point to His example, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we, through his poverty, might be rich, 2Co 8:9.

I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words&#8212;When such disorders came to the knowledge of the governor, his honest indignation was roused against the perpetrators of the evil. Having summoned a public assembly, he denounced their conduct in terms of just severity. He contrasted it with his own in redeeming with his money some of the Jewish exiles who, through debt or otherwise, had lost their personal liberty in Babylon. He urged the rich creditors not only to abandon their illegal and oppressive system of usury, but to restore the fields and vineyards of the poor, so that a remedy might be put to an evil the introduction of which had led to much actual disorder, and the continuance of which would inevitably prove ruinous to the newly restored colony, by violating the fundamental principles of the Hebrew constitution. The remonstrance was effectual. The conscience of the usurious oppressors could not resist the touching and powerful appeal. With mingled emotions of shame, contrition, and fear, they with one voice expressed their readiness to comply with the governor's recommendation. The proceedings were closed by the parties binding themselves by a solemn oath, administered by the priests, that they would redeem their pledge, as well as by the governor invoking, by the solemn and significant gesture of shaking a corner of his garment, a malediction on those who should violate it. The historian has taken care to record that the people did according to this promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye exact usury every one of his brother; </span> which was against the plain and positive law of God, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm" title="You shall not lend on usury to your brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent on usury:">Deu 23:19</a>,20</span>; especially in this time of public calamity and dearth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I set a great assembly against them; </span> I called a public congregation, both of the rulers and people, the greatest part whereof were free from this guilt, and therefore mere impartial judges of the matter, and represented it to them, that the offenders might be convinced, and reform this abuse; if not for fear of God, or love of their brethren, yet at least for the public shame, and the cries of the poor. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then I consulted with myself,....

And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.">Nehemiah 13:11</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-17.htm" title="Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the sabbath day?">Nehemiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-25.htm" title="And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves.">Nehemiah 13:25</a>. It denotes the conflict of opinion as well as the administration of reproach. Cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-9.htm" title="Why I will yet plead with you, said the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.">Jeremiah 2:9</a>. ‘The nobles and the rulers,’ as in <a href="/nehemiah/2-16.htm" title="And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.">Nehemiah 2:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">You exact usury, every one of his brother</span>] The reader should refer to the passages in the Pentateuch bearing upon usury, (<span class="ital">a</span>) <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a>. This passage relates to the dealings between Israelites. The purpose of lending is to assist a brother. Interest is not to be exacted but pledges are permitted. The giving of pledges is regulated by principles of charity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) <a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-19.htm" title="You shall not lend on usury to your brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent on usury:...">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>. The Deuteronomic law forbids interest upon loans advanced to Israelites, but permits them with foreigners. The principle of brotherhood is upheld in the nation. The rules regulating ‘the giving of pledges’ are repeated (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/24-10.htm" title="When you do lend your brother any thing, you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge....">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) <a href="/context/leviticus/25-35.htm" title="And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you....">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>. This law treats only of dealing with Israelites, and prohibits all idea of making gain out of assistance rendered to brethren in distress.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In all three passages, the law contemplates the lending of money to the poor man in distress. The taking of a pledge or security is permitted, but not the exaction of interest from a fellow-countryman. Nehemiah himself exacted interest upon loans (<a href="/nehemiah/5-10.htm" title="I likewise, and my brothers, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.">Nehemiah 5:10</a>). We are not therefore to suppose that his indignation was directed against the practice of usury, but against the hard-heartedness and covetousness of the usurers. Mere denunciation against them for these moral failings would have availed nothing. He wisely puts in the forefront of his expostulation the general statement that the Jews were practising ‘usury’ against their brethren. He implies that this was contrary to the spirit of the law and to good fellowship. He himself sought to relieve his brethren (<a href="/nehemiah/5-8.htm" title="And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.">Nehemiah 5:8</a>), but he and his companions had, he confessed, given way to the custom of the time, and had lent on usury, although he had not been exacting in his demands. He and the wealthy professional money-lenders had both done wrong. He had been merciful and they had not This was the only difference. On the general principle he therefore proposed that all taking of interest from needy fellow-countrymen should be abandoned. His manner of approaching the subject conciliated the rulers, as he associated himself with their wrong-doing. He benefited the poor by procuring the abolition of usurious transactions. He upheld the charitable principle of the old Israelite law. The violation of it is the subject of rebuke in very different periods. <a href="/amos/2-8.htm" title="And they lay themselves down on clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.">Amos 2:8</a>; <a href="/job/22-6.htm" title="For you have taken a pledge from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.">Job 22:6</a>; <a href="/job/24-3.htm" title="They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.">Job 24:3</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/13-22.htm" title="When a rich man is fallen, he hath many helpers: he speaketh things not to be spoken, and yet men justify him: the poor man slipped, and yet they rebuked him too; he spake wisely, and could have no place....">Sir 13:22-23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That the strict law of Israel forbade taking upon usury is shown by a comparison of such passages as <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm" title="He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.">Psalm 15:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-26.htm" title="He is ever merciful, and lends; and his seed is blessed.">Psalm 37:26</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm" title="He that by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.">Proverbs 28:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-8.htm" title="He that has not given forth on usury, neither has taken any increase, that has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true judgment between man and man,">Ezekiel 18:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-13.htm" title="Has given forth on usury, and has taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him.">Ezekiel 18:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-17.htm" title="That has taken off his hand from the poor, that has not received usury nor increase, has executed my judgments, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.">Ezekiel 18:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-12.htm" title="In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; you have taken usury and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten me, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 22:12</a>. But that these passages as well as the laws in Ex., Lev., Deut. refer primarily to usury upon charitable loans seems probable. Usury as a legitimate financial transaction between Jews seems to have been recognized by the Jews (cf. <a href="/matthew/25-27.htm" title="You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with usury.">Matthew 25:27</a>); but in the Talmud it is forbidden.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And I set a great assembly</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">And I held a great assembly.</span> ‘Assembly.’ The word here used occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-4.htm" title="Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.">Deuteronomy 33:4</a>, ‘the assembly of Jacob.’ Nehemiah’s object probably was to give a public hearing to the complaints, and by the largeness and importance of the meeting to establish beyond controversy an arrangement which was calculated to meet with disapprobation from an influential class.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury.</span> So the Vulgate, and most commentators; but Bertheau has shown that the expression used, which is peculiar to Nehemiah, cannot have this meaning, since it is not the taking of usury that has been complained of, or that Nehemiah is especially anxious to stop, but the lending of money upon the security of lands, houses, or children, with its consequences, the forfeiture of the lands and houses, with the enslavement of the children. He therefore translates, "I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye <span class="accented">lend upon pledge</span>." <span class="cmt_word">I set a great assembly against them</span>. It is evident that Nehemiah's rebuke had no effect. The nobles gave him no reason to think that they would change their conduct. He was therefore compelled to bring the matter before the people; not that they had any legal power, but he felt that the nobles might be ashamed or afraid to continue their oppression when it was openly denounced by the chief civil ruler in the hearing of a great assembly of their countrymen. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The people complain of oppression. - <a href="/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1</a> There arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews, i.e., as appears from what follows (<a href="/nehemiah/5-7.htm">Nehemiah 5:7</a>), against the nobles and rulers, therefore against the richer members of the community.
