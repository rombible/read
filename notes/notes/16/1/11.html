Many of the Jews, by the singular favour of God, obtained considerable dignities in their captivity, as Daniel and his companions, Zerubbabel and others; among whom was this pious man, who was advanced to this office of cup-bearer when he was but a youth; which, it must be observed, was a place of great honour and advantage in the Persian court, because of the privilege which it gave him who bore it, of being daily in the king’s presence, and the opportunity which he had thereby of gaining his favour for the procuring of any petition he should make to him. That it was a place of great temporal advantage, seems evident by Nehemiah’s gaining those immense riches which enabled him, for so many years, (<a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm" title="Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.">Nehemiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-19.htm" title="Think on me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.">Nehemiah 5:19</a>,) out of his own privy purse only, to live in his government with great splendour and expense, without burdening the people at all.

There is an obvious interval of time between ch. 1. and ch. 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and grant him mercy</span>] The idiom here employed, literally ‘and give him to mercy’ occurs with the word here used for ‘mercy’ (rachamim = ‘bowels’ or ‘mercies,’ <span class="greekheb">τὰ σπλάγχνα</span>) in <a href="/1_kings/8-50.htm" title="And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:">1 Kings 8:50</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-46.htm" title="He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.">Psalm 106:46</a>.

Compare the use of the plural, ‘cupbearers,’ <a href="/1_kings/10-5.htm" title="And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-4.htm" title="And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>; the title of ‘chief butler,’ i.e. chief of the cupbearer, in Genesis 40, 41; and the title Rab-shakeh (= chief cupbearer) in <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm" title="And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.">2 Kings 18:17</a>. This last passage shows the important place occupied at the court by the head of these functionaries. For, although the title probably represents the Assyrian ‘<span class="ital">Rab-sak</span>’ = ‘Generalissimo,’ the Hebrew transliteration of it, based on the similarity of sound conveyed the idea of ‘chief cupbearer’ to Hebrew readers, and presupposed his prominence among the ministers of an Oriental king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A good representation of the duties of a ‘cupbearer’ at the Persian court is given by Xenophon (<span class="ital">Cyrop.</span> i. 3, 4). See note on <a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king.

The old Rabbinic explanation of the word ‘Tirshatha,’ as equivalent to ‘cupbearer’ and therefore applied to Nehemiah, is an illustration of obsolete methods of derivation (see <a href="/ezra/2-63.htm" title="And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.">Ezra 2:63</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prosper thy servant this day</span>. "This day" does not perhaps mean more than "at this time"- in connection with this matter which is now in my thoughts. And grant him mercy in the sight of this man. "This man" is, of course, Artaxerxes, though as yet he has not been named. Nehemiah's thoughts have far outstripped his words. He has made up his mind that, in order to remove the reproach of Jerusalem, he must go there in person; that, to do so, he must obtain the king's permission; and that, to get his permission, he needs to be in very special favour with him. All depending on one man only, he has one man only in his mind, who becomes to him, therefore, "this man." <span class="cmt_word">I was the king's cupbearer</span>. Literally, "I was cupbearer to the king." Not his sole cupbearer, but one of many. He mentions the fact here, partly to explain the meaning of "this man" to the reader, partly because it was his office which would give him access to Artaxerxes, and enable him to profit by the royal "mercy" or favour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nehemiah's prayer, as given in these verses, comprises the prayers which he prayed day and night, during the period of his mourning and fasting (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a> comp. <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6</a>), to his faithful and covenant God, to obtain mercy for his people, and the divine blessing upon his project for their assistance.<p><a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a><p>The invocation of Jahve as: Thou God of heaven, alludes to God's almighty government of the world, and the further predicates of God, to His covenant faithfulness.
