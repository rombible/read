In spite of their sin and disobedience, the children of Israel are still God’s servants, cf. <a href="/leviticus/25-55.htm" title="For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 25:55</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm" title="O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.">Isaiah 63:17</a>. The exact phrase used here does not occur elsewhere. But the permanent ideal relation, in spite of all failure or rebellion, is frequently expressed in the prophets; cf. ‘Jacob, my servant,’ used in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb, which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and you, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.">Isaiah 44:2</a> &c.), Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm" title="Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, said the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, see, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.">Jeremiah 30:10</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/46-27.htm" title="But fear not you, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar off, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid....">Jeremiah 46:27-28</a>), <a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm" title="And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelled; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.">Ezekiel 37:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and confess</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">while I confess.</span> The A.V. is not grammatical.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Confess.’ See on <a href="/ezra/10-1.htm" title="Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.">Ezra 10:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the sins of the children of Israel, which we</span> &c.] Nehemiah identifies himself with the guilt of the people.

It has been remarked that, if Nehemiah belonged to the house of David, there would be a special appropriateness in these words. According to one tradition (Euseb.), he was of the tribe of Judah.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Both I and my father's house have sinned</span>. Ewald well observes, "In the prayer of Nehemiah the keynote is struck in the words, 'I and my father's house have sinned'" ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 149, note 1). The desolation which he mourns is the result of the people's sins, and in those sins are included his own, and those of his ancestors. His own may not have been very grievous, but those of his fathers weigh upon him as if his own, and oppress his spirit. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/ezra/10-44.htm">Ezra 10:44</a> contains the statement with which the account of this transaction closes. The Chethiv &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1497;&#1468; seems to be an error of transcription for &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; (the Keri), which the sense requires. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1492;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "and there were among them women who had brought forth sons." &#1502;&#1492;&#1501; must be referred to women, notwithstanding the masculine suffix. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;, too, can only be referred to &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, and cannot be explained, as by J. H. Mich.: unde etiam filios susceperant seu procreaverant. The gender of the verb is adapted to the form of the word &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, an incorrectness which must be attributed to the increasing tendency of the language to use the masculine instead of the feminine, or to renounce a distinction of form between the genders. There are no adequate reasons for such an alteration of the text as Bertheau proposes; for the lxx already had our text before them, and the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; of 1 Esdr. 9:36 is a mere conjecture from the context. The remark itself, that among the women who were sent away were some who had already brought children into the world, is not superfluous, but added for the purpose of showing how thoroughly this matter was carried out. Separation from women who already have children is far more grievous, ob communium liberorum caritatem, than parting with childless wives.<p>Strictly as this separation was carried out, this evil was not thereby done away with for ever, nor even for very long. After the arrival of Nehemiah at Jerusalem, when the building of the wall was concluded, the congregation again bound themselves by an oath, on the occasion of a day of prayer and fasting, to contract no more such illegal marriages (<a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>). Nevertheless, Nehemiah, on his second return to Jerusalem, some five and twenty to thirty years after the dissolution of these marriages by Ezra, again found Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Moab, and Ammon, and children of these marriages who spoke the tongue of Ashdod, and could not speak the Jews' language, and even one of the sons of the high priest Jehoiada allied to a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-28.htm">Nehemiah 13:28</a>, etc.). Such a phenomenon, however strange it may appear on a superficial view of the matter, becomes comprehensible when we consider more closely the circumstances of the times. The nucleus of the Israelite community in Jerusalem and Judah was formed by those exiles who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Ezra; and to this nucleus the remnant of Jewish and Israelite descent which had been left in the land was gradually united, after the rebuilding of the temple and the restoration of the worship of Jahve. Those who returned from Babylon, as well as those who remained in the land, had now, however, lived seventy, and some of them one hundred and fifty, years (from the captivity of Jehoiachin in 599, to the return of Ezra in 457) among the heathen, and in the midst of heathen surroundings, and had thus become so accustomed to intercourse with them in civil and social transactions, that the consciousness of the barriers placed by the Mosaic law between Israel, the people of Jahve, and the Gentiles, was more and more obliterated. And this would specially be the case when the Gentiles who entered into matrimonial alliance with Israelites did not flagrantly practise idolatrous worship, i.e., did not offer sacrifice to heathen deities. Under such circumstances, it must have been extremely difficult to do away entirely with these unlawful unions; although, without a thorough reform in this respect, the successful development of the new community in the land of their fathers was not to be obtained.<p>Ezra's narrative of his agency in Jerusalem closes with the account of the dissolution of the unlawful marriages then existing. What he subsequently effected for the revival of religion and morality in the re-established community, in conformity with the law of God, was more of an inward and spiritual kind; and was either of such a nature that no striking results ensued, which could furnish matter for historical narrative, or was performed during the period of his joint agency with Nehemiah, of which an account is furnished by the latter in the record he has handed down to us (<a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>).</body></html>
