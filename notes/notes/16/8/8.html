Masters of families should bring their families with them to the public worship of God. Women and children have souls to save, and are therefore to acquaint themselves with the word of God, and to attend on the means of grace. Little ones, as they come to reason, must be trained up in religion. Ministers when they go to the pulpit, should take their Bibles with them; Ezra did so. Thence they must fetch their knowledge; according to that rule they must speak, and must show that they do so. Reading the Scriptures in religious assemblies is an ordinance of God, whereby he is honoured, and his church edified. Those who hear the word, should understand it, else it is to them but an empty sound of words. It is therefore required of teachers that they explain the word, and give the sense of it. Reading is good, and preaching is good, but expounding makes reading the better understood, and preaching the more convincing. It has pleased God in almost every age of the church to raise up, not only those who have preached the gospel, but also those who have given their views of Divine truth in writing; and though many who have attempted to explain Scripture, have darkened counsel by words without knowledge, yet the labours of others are of excellent use. All that we hear must, however, be brought to the test of Scripture. They heard readily, and minded every word. The word of God demands attention. If through carelessness we let much slip in hearing, there is danger that through forgetfulness we shall let all slip after hearing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gave the sense - Either by rendering the Hebrew into the Aramaic dialect, or perhaps simply by explaining obscure words or passages.<p>Caused them to understand - Either "they (the people) understood what was read;" or, "they (the Levites) expounded as they read." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8. caused the people to understand the law &#8230; gave the sense&#8212;Commentators are divided in opinion as to the import of this statement.

On the word see note on <a href="/ezra/4-18.htm" title="The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.">Ezra 4:18</a>. The rendering of the R.V. marg. is sometimes based on the erroneous supposition that the Jews had returned from Babylon speaking Chaldee or Aramaic, and that in consequence the Hebrew of ‘the Law’ had to be ‘interpreted’ in the sense of ‘translated.’ This would have been necessary in much later times. But in the time of Nehemiah, if we may judge from the writings of Nehemiah and Malachi, the <span class="ital">people’s</span> dialect had not yet undergone the change, which may have begun very soon afterwards. The common misapprehension of our verse arises from the erroneous impression that Chaldee was the language of the ‘Chaldeans’ spoken in Babylon and there acquired by the Jews. But in Babylon and Babylonia the spoken language was ‘Assyrian,’ another branch of the Semitic family. The ‘Chaldee’ of the Bible is the Aramaic or North Semitic dialect. See Introduction, and cf. note on <a href="/nehemiah/13-24.htm" title="And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.">Nehemiah 13:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word in the original occurs in <a href="/numbers/15-34.htm" title="And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.">Numbers 15:34</a>, ‘it had not been <span class="ital">declared</span> (i.e. made clear) what should be done unto him.’ The rendering ‘distinctly’ means with clearness and precision, for which careful study was required. Some understand ‘with an interpretation’ in the sense of ‘with exposition;’ while the possibility of this explanation may be admitted, it is open to the objection that it anticipates the substance of the clause which immediately follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused</span> them <span class="ital">to understand</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood.</span> Marg. as A.V. <span class="ital">and caused</span>, &c.

The clause ‘so that they understood’ is subordinate to, denoting the result of, the previous words ‘gave the sense.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘so that they understood the reading,’ so that they understood what was being read. The word for ‘the reading’ ‘hammiq’ra’ here used of the public reading, became in later times a technical Rabbinic word for ‘Scripture.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ancient versions treat the words as an independent clause, ‘And the people understood the reading,’ (LXX. <span class="greekheb">καὶ συνῆκεν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ ἀναγνώσει</span>. Vulg. ‘et intellexerunt cum legeretur,’) which gives a good sense, but misses the interdependence of the two sentences. It is a mistake to suppose that the R.V. rendering of the two clauses is tautological. The Levites ‘gave the sense,’ not mechanically, but so that the people grasped its meaning.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They read in the book in the law of God distinctly</span>.

The public reading of the law. - <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>. The introduction to this narrative (<a href="/nehemiah/7-73.htm">Nehemiah 7:73</a>b-8:1a) is identical with <a href="/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1</a>. The same matter, the assembling of the people on the approach of the seventh month, is described in the same words. But the object of this assembling of the people was a different one from that mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1-13</a>. Then they met to restore the altar of burnt-offering and the sacrificial worship; now, on the contrary, for the due solemnization of the seventh month, the festal month of the year. For this purpose the people came from the cities and villages of Judah to Jerusalem, and assembled "in the open space before the water-gate," i.e., to the south-east of the temple space. On the situation of the water-gate, see rem. on <a href="/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>., and <a href="/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9</a>. "And they spake unto Ezra the scribe" (see rem. on <a href="/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a>). The subject of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is the assembled people. These requested, through their rulers, that Ezra should fetch the book of the law of Moses, and publicly read it. This reading, then, was desired by the assembly. The motive for this request is undoubtedly to be found in the desire of the congregation to keep the new moon of the seventh month, as a feast of thanksgiving for the gracious assistance they had received from the Lord during the building of the wall, and through which it had been speedily and successfully completed, in spite of the attempts of their enemies to obstruct the work. This feeling of thankfulness impelled them to the hearing of the word of God for the purpose of making His law their rule of life. The assembly consisted of men and women indiscriminately (&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-25.htm">Joshua 8:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">1 Chronicles 16:3</a>), and &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, every one that understood in hearing, which would certainly include the elder children. The first day of the seventh month was distinguished above the other new moons of the year as the feast of trumpets, and celebrated as a high festival by a solemn assembly and a cessation from labour; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-23.htm">Leviticus 23:23-25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1-6</a>.</body></html>
