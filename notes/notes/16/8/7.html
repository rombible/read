Masters of families should bring their families with them to the public worship of God. Women and children have souls to save, and are therefore to acquaint themselves with the word of God, and to attend on the means of grace. Little ones, as they come to reason, must be trained up in religion. Ministers when they go to the pulpit, should take their Bibles with them; Ezra did so. Thence they must fetch their knowledge; according to that rule they must speak, and must show that they do so. Reading the Scriptures in religious assemblies is an ordinance of God, whereby he is honoured, and his church edified. Those who hear the word, should understand it, else it is to them but an empty sound of words. It is therefore required of teachers that they explain the word, and give the sense of it. Reading is good, and preaching is good, but expounding makes reading the better understood, and preaching the more convincing. It has pleased God in almost every age of the church to raise up, not only those who have preached the gospel, but also those who have given their views of Divine truth in writing; and though many who have attempted to explain Scripture, have darkened counsel by words without knowledge, yet the labours of others are of excellent use. All that we hear must, however, be brought to the test of Scripture. They heard readily, and minded every word. The word of God demands attention. If through carelessness we let much slip in hearing, there is danger that through forgetfulness we shall let all slip after hearing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The names here (and in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-4.htm">Nehemiah 9:4</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/9-5.htm">Nehemiah 9:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-9.htm">Nehemiah 10:9</a>) seem not to be the personal appellations of individuals, but rather designations of Levitical families, the descendants respectively of Jeshua, etc., who lived not later than the time of Zerubbabel <a href="/nehemiah/7-43.htm">Nehemiah 7:43</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-8.htm">Nehemiah 12:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8. caused the people to understand the law &#8230; gave the sense&#8212;Commentators are divided in opinion as to the import of this statement.

The public reading of the law. - <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>. The introduction to this narrative (<a href="/nehemiah/7-73.htm">Nehemiah 7:73</a>b-8:1a) is identical with <a href="/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1</a>. The same matter, the assembling of the people on the approach of the seventh month, is described in the same words. But the object of this assembling of the people was a different one from that mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1-13</a>. Then they met to restore the altar of burnt-offering and the sacrificial worship; now, on the contrary, for the due solemnization of the seventh month, the festal month of the year. For this purpose the people came from the cities and villages of Judah to Jerusalem, and assembled "in the open space before the water-gate," i.e., to the south-east of the temple space. On the situation of the water-gate, see rem. on <a href="/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>., and <a href="/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9</a>. "And they spake unto Ezra the scribe" (see rem. on <a href="/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a>). The subject of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is the assembled people. These requested, through their rulers, that Ezra should fetch the book of the law of Moses, and publicly read it. This reading, then, was desired by the assembly. The motive for this request is undoubtedly to be found in the desire of the congregation to keep the new moon of the seventh month, as a feast of thanksgiving for the gracious assistance they had received from the Lord during the building of the wall, and through which it had been speedily and successfully completed, in spite of the attempts of their enemies to obstruct the work. This feeling of thankfulness impelled them to the hearing of the word of God for the purpose of making His law their rule of life. The assembly consisted of men and women indiscriminately (&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, like <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-25.htm">Joshua 8:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-3.htm">1 Chronicles 16:3</a>), and &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, every one that understood in hearing, which would certainly include the elder children. The first day of the seventh month was distinguished above the other new moons of the year as the feast of trumpets, and celebrated as a high festival by a solemn assembly and a cessation from labour; comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-23.htm">Leviticus 23:23-25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1-6</a>.</body></html>
