But notwithstanding the painful remembrances of their national sins which the reading of the law awakened, the people were exhorted to cherish the feelings of joy and thankfulness associated with a sacred festival (see on [489]Le 23:24).

Nehemiah in his own ‘Memoirs’ speaks of himself as ‘Pekhah’ (cf. <a href="/context/nehemiah/5-14.htm" title="Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor....">Nehemiah 5:14-15</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-18.htm" title="Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people.">Nehemiah 5:18</a>); and in consequence some (e.g. Smend) suggest that the title applied here and in <a href="/nehemiah/10-2.htm" title="Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,">Nehemiah 10:2</a> to Nehemiah, is a gloss. Others also (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm" title="And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.">Nehemiah 8:1</a></span>) who refer the events described in this chapter to the year 457, consider Nehemiah’s name to be an interpolation. But the occurrence of the title is only evidence that we are no longer dealing with the writings of Nehemiah, who would have styled himself ‘Pekhah.’ The LXX. omits the title: the Vulg. gives <span class="ital">Athersatha</span>. The supposition that Nehemiah purposely eschews the honorific title ‘Tirshatha,’ and prefers a more lowly term ‘pekhah’ is based on an imaginary distinction between the words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This <span class="ital">day</span> is <span class="ital">holy</span>] Both as a new-moon day and as the day on which the Law was read.

As they listened to the words of the Law, they perceived in how many ways they had violated it. Compare the effect of hearing ‘the words of the book of the law’ upon Josiah, <a href="/2_kings/22-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.">2 Kings 22:11</a>.
