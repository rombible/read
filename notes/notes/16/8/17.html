To this Poole adds, They never, since Joshua’s time, kept this feast so solemnly and religiously: for whereas, at other times, only the first and last day of that feast were celebrated with a holy convocation, now there was a holy convocation, and the people assembled, and attended upon the reading of the law every day of this feast.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:13-18 They found written in the law about the feast of tabernacles. Those who diligently search the Scriptures, find things written there which they have forgotten. This feast of tabernacles was a representation of the believer's tabernacle state in this world, and a type of the holy joy of the gospel church. The conversion of the nations to the faith of Christ, is foretold under the figure of this feast, Zec 14:16. True religion will render us strangers and pilgrims upon earth. We read and hear the word acceptably and profitably, when we do according to what is written therein; when what appears to be our duty is revived, after it has been neglected. They minded the substance; else the ceremony had been of no use. They did it, rejoicing in God and his goodness. These are the means which the Spirit of God crowns with success, in bringing the hearts of sinners to tremble and to become humbled before God. But those are enemies to their own growth in holiness, who always indulge sorrow, even for sin, and put away from them the consolations tendered by the word and Spirit of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is not the intention of the writer to state that the Feast of tabernacles had not been kept from the time of Joshua until this occasion (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a>); but that there had been no such celebration as this since Joshua's time.

Besides that it is impossible that such a flagrant disregard of the law could have been tolerated by Samuel, David, and other pious rulers, its observance is sufficiently indicated (1Ki 8:2, 65; 2Ch 7:9) and expressly recorded (Ezr 3:4). But the meaning is, that the popular feelings had never been raised to such a height of enthusiastic joy since the time of their entrance into Canaan, as now on their return after a long and painful captivity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For since the days of Jeshua, </span> or, <span class="ital">surely</span> since the days, as the Hebrew <span class="ital">chi</span> is oft used, as hath been noted before.

Besides, that this feast was observed is sufficiently implied in <span class="bld"><a href="/1_kings/8-2.htm" title="And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.">1 Kings 8:2</a>,65 <a href="/2_chronicles/7-9.htm" title="And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.">2 Chronicles 7:9</a></span>, and is particularly expressed <span class="bld"><a href="/ezra/3-4.htm" title="They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;">Ezra 3:4</a></span>.

They never kept this feast so joyfully, as the next words declare, having not only the same causes of rejoicing which they formerly had, but some special causes to increase their joy, to wit, the remembrance of their stupendous deliverance, both out of the land of their captivity, and out of the hands of their wicked and malicious neighbours ever since their return, and especially now when they were new building the walls of Jerusalem: they never kept it so solemnly and religiously; for whereas at other times only the first and last day of that feast were celebrated with a holy convocation, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/23-35.htm" title="On the first day shall be an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:35</a>,36 Joh 7:37</span>, now there was a holy convocation, and the people assembled, and attended upon the reading of the law, every day of this feast, as is noted in the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the congregation of them that were come again out of captivity made booths,....

The emphasis therefore rests on ‘done so.’ See notes on <a href="/ezra/3-4.htm" title="They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;">Ezra 3:4</a>, &c., where the celebration of this feast by Zerubbabel and Jeshua is described.

The character of this sentence may be illustrated by the very similar description of Josiah’s Passover, <a href="/2_kings/23-22.htm" title="Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;">2 Kings 23:22</a>, ‘Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah,’ <a href="/2_chronicles/35-18.htm" title="And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Jeshua.’ The only passage in the O.T. where Joshua’s name is so spelt; except in the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua, his name is only mentioned in the O.T. in <a href="/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Jdg 1:1</a>; <a href="/context/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land....">Jdg 2:6-8</a>; <a href="/judges/2-21.htm" title="I also will not from now on drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:">Jdg 2:21</a>; <a href="/judges/2-23.htm" title="Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.">Jdg 2:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-34.htm" title="In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.">1 Kings 16:34</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">great gladness</span>] This corresponds to the commands in <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm" title="And you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.">Leviticus 23:40</a>, ‘And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.’ <a href="/deuteronomy/16-14.htm" title="And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates.">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>, ‘Thou shalt rejoice in thy feast;’ <a href="/deuteronomy/16-15.htm" title="Seven days shall you keep a solemn feast to the LORD your God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD your God shall bless you in all your increase, and in all the works of your hands, therefore you shall surely rejoice.">Deuteronomy 16:15</a>, ‘And thou shalt be altogether joyful.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jeshua the son of Nun</span>.
