The people were to send portions to those for whom nothing was prepared. It is the duty of a religious feast, as well as of a religious fast, to draw out the soul to the hungry; God's bounty should make us bountiful. We must not only give to those that offer themselves, but send to those out of sight. Their strength consisted in joy in the Lord.

This day is holy unto the Lord &#8230; mourn not, nor weep&#8212;A deep sense of their national sins, impressively brought to their remembrance by the reading of the law and its denunciations, affected the hearts of the people with penitential sorrow. But notwithstanding the painful remembrances of their national sins which the reading of the law awakened, the people were exhorted to cherish the feelings of joy and thankfulness associated with a sacred festival (see on [489]Le 23:24). By sending portions of it to their poorer brethren (De 16:11, 14; Es 9:19), they would also enable them to participate in the public rejoicings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Because they now knew God’s mind, and their own duty, which they were resolved to practise; which gave them ground of hope and trust in God’s mercy, and consequently of great and just joy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the people went their way to eat and to drink,....

Some think that we should understand by them the command of Ezra and the Levites that the people should be joyful (<a href="/context/nehemiah/8-9.htm" title="And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.

But this gives a very limited application, and we should then have expected some other verb like ‘obeyed’ or ‘gave heed to’ rather than ‘understood.’ It will be noticed that the word ‘understood’ is the same as that used in <a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm" title="So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.">Nehemiah 8:8</a>. This supplies the probable interpretation.
