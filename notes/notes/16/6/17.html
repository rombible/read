A great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we set about it in earnest, and keep close to it. See the mischief of marrying with strangers. When men once became akin to Tobiah, they soon became sworn to him. A sinful love leads to a sinful league. The enemy of souls employs many instruments, and forms many projects, to bring reproach on the active servants of God, or to take them from their work. But we should follow the example of Him who laid down his life for the sheep.

But Nehemiah's narrative is thoroughly consistent with itself, and contains in it nothing that is improbable. The walls everywhere existed at the time that he commenced his task, and only needed repairs. The work was partitioned among at least 37 working parties, who labored simultaneously, with material ready at hand; and, notwithstanding all menaces, uninterruptedly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-14. Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah, &c.&#8212;This man was the son of a priest, who was an intimate and confidential friend of Nehemiah. The young man claimed to be endowed with the gift of prophecy. Having been secretly bribed by Sanballat, he, in his pretended capacity of prophet, told Nehemiah that his enemies were that night to make an attempt upon his life. He advised him, at the same time, to consult his safety by concealing himself in the sanctuary, a crypt which, from its sanctity, was strong and secure. But the noble-minded governor determined at all hazards to remain at his post, and not bring discredit on the cause of God and religion by his unworthy cowardice in leaving the temple and city unprotected. This plot, together with a secret collusion between the enemy and the nobles of Judah who were favorably disposed towards the bad Samaritan in consequence of his Jewish connections (Ne 6:18), the undaunted courage and vigilance of Nehemiah were enabled, with the blessing of God, to defeat, and the erection of the walls thus built in troublous times (Da 9:25) was happily completed (Ne 6:15) in the brief space of fifty-two days. So rapid execution, even supposing some parts of the old wall standing, cannot be sufficiently accounted for, except by the consideration that the builders labored with the ardor of religious zeal, as men employed in the work of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Corresponding with him against Nehemiah, and against their own city and nation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, in those days,....

Ewald supposes that the circumstances here related (vers. 17-19) were subsequent to the completion of the wall ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 157); but the expression "in those days" seems rather to throw back the events into the time during which the wall was in building.
