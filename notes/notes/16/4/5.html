Those who disagree in almost every thing, will unite in persecution. Nehemiah did not answer these fools according to their folly, but looked up to God by prayer. God's people have often been a despised people, but he hears all the slights that are put upon them, and it is their comfort that he does so. Nehemiah had reason to think that the hearts of those sinners were desperately hardened, else he would not have prayed that their sins might never be blotted out. Good work goes on well, when people have a mind to it. The reproaches of enemies should quicken us to our duty, not drive us from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The parenthetical prayers of Nehemiah form one of the most striking characteristics of his history.

Hear, O our God; for we are despised&#8212;The imprecations invoked here may seem harsh, cruel, and vindictive; but it must be remembered that Nehemiah and his friends regarded those Samaritan leaders as enemies to the cause of God and His people, and therefore as deserving to be visited with heavy judgments. The prayer, therefore, is to be considered as emanating from hearts in which neither hatred, revenge, nor any inferior passion, but a pious and patriotic zeal for the glory of God and the success of His cause, held the ascendant sway.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; </span> let their wickedness be in thy sight, so as to bring down deserved judgments it. upon them, that either they may be convinced and reformed, or others may be warned by their example.

Compare <a href="/psalms/109-14.htm" title="Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.">Psalm 109:14</a>, ‘Let the iniquity of his fathers be <span class="ital">remembered</span> with the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be <span class="ital">blotted out</span>.’ The metaphor is differently applied in <a href="/psalms/69-28.htm" title="Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.">Psalm 69:28</a>, ‘Let them be <span class="ital">blotted out</span> of the book of life.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for they have provoked</span> thee <span class="ital">to anger</span>] The verb, which is of frequent occurrence in connexion with idolatrous practices, is here used absolutely as in <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2 Kings 21:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-22.htm" title="And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.">2 Kings 21:22</a>.

Compare again Rabshakeh’s endeavour to shake the fidelity of the people of Jerusalem, <a href="/context/2_kings/18-26.htm" title="Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall....">2 Kings 18:26-28</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cover not their iniquity</span>, etc. Some of David's imprecations are very similar (<a href="/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7, 14, 15</a>, etc.), as also some of Jeremiah's (<a href="/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have provoked thee to anger before the builders</span>.

The statements, (he repaired) unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants opposite the gate &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;, and to the upper chamber of the corner, are obscure. This rendering is according to the Masoretic punctuation; while the lxx, on the contrary, translate according to a different division of the words: Malchiah repaired as far as the house of the Nethinim, and the spice-merchants (repaired) opposite the gate Miphkad, and as far as the ascent of the corner. This translation is preferred by Bertheau, but upon questionable grounds. For the objection made by him, that if the other be adopted, either the same termination would be stated twice in different forms, or that two different terminations are intended, in which case it does not appear why one only should first be mentioned, and then the other also, is not of much importance. In <a href="/nehemiah/3-24.htm">Nehemiah 3:24</a> also two terminations are mentioned, while in <a href="/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16</a> we have even three together. And why should not this occur here also? Of more weight is the consideration, that to follow the Masoretic punctuation is to make the house of the Nethinim and of the merchants but one building. Since, however, we know nothing further concerning the edifice in question, the subject is not one for discussion. The rendering of the lxx, on the other hand, is opposed by the weighty objection that there is a total absence of analogy for supplying &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;; for throughout this long enumeration of forty-two sections of wall, the verb &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511; or &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, or some corresponding verb, always stands either before or after every name of the builders, and even the &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; is omitted only once (<a href="/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>). To the statement, "as far as the house of the Nethinim and the merchants," is appended the further definition: before (opposite) the gate &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;. This word is reproduced in the lxx as a proper name (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;), as is also &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;); in the Vulgate it is rendered appellatively: contra portam judicialem; and hence by Luther, Rathsthor. Thenius translates (Stadt, p. 9): the muster or punishment gate. &#1502;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; does not, however, signify punishment, although the view may be correct that the gate took the name &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; from the &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; mentioned <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a>, where the bullock of the sin-offering was to be burnt without the sanctuary; and it may be inferred from this passage that near the temple of Solomon also there was an appointed place for burning the flesh of the sin-offering without the sanctuary. In Ezekiel's temple vision, this &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; is probably to be sought in the space behind the sanctuary, i.e., at the western end of the great square of five hundred cubits, set apart for the temple, and designated the Gizra, or separate place. In the temples of Solomon and Zerubbabel, however, the place in question could not have been situate at the west side of the temple, between the temple and the city, which lay opposite, but only on the south side of the temple area, outside the court, upon Ophel, where Thenius has delineated it in his plan of Jerusalem before the captivity. Whether it lay, however, at the south-western corner of the temple space (Thenius), or in the middle, or near the east end of the southern side of the external wall of the temple or temple court, can be determined neither from the present passage nor from Ezekiel's vision. Not from <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a>, because the temple vision of this prophet is of an ideal character, differing in many points from the actual temple; not from the present passage, because the position of the house of the Nethinim and the merchants is unknown, and the definition &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, (before) opposite the gate Miphkad, admits of several explanations. Thus much only is certain concerning this Miphkad gate, - on the one hand, from the circumstance that the wall was built before (&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;) or opposite this gate, on the other, from its omission in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>, where the prison-gate is mentioned as being in this neighbourhood in its stead, - that it was not a gate of the city, but a gate through which the &#1502;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491; was reached. Again, it is evident that the &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; of the corner which is mentioned as the length of wall next following, must be sought for at the south-eastern corner of the temple area. Hence the house of the temple servants and the merchants must have been situate south of this, on the eastern side of Ophel, where it descends into the valley of Kidron. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;, the upper chamber of the corner, was perhaps a &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; of a corner tower, not at the north-eastern corner of the external circumvallation of the temple area (Bertheau), but at the south-eastern corner, which was formed by the junction at this point of the wall of Ophel with the eastern wall of the temple area. If these views are correct, all the sections mentioned from <a href="/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a> to <a href="/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a> belong to the wall surrounding Ophel. This must have been of considerable length, for Ophel extended almost to the pool of Siloam, and was walled round on its western, southern, and eastern sides.</body></html>
