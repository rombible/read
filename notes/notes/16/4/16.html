The word of God is the sword of the Spirit, which we ought to have always at hand, and never to have to seek for it, either in our labours, or in our conflicts, as Christians. Every true Christian is both a labourer and a soldier, working with one hand, and fighting with the other. Good work is likely to go on with success, when those who labour in it, make a business of it. And Satan fears to assault the watchful Christian; or, if attacked, the Lord fights for him. Thus must we wait to the close of life, never putting off our armour till our work and warfare are ended; then we shall be welcomed to the rest and joy of our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Habergeons - Or, "coats of mail."

He Sets a Watch.<p>7-21. But &#8230; when Sanballat &#8230; heard that the walls &#8230; were made up, and &#8230; the breaches &#8230; stopped&#8212;The rapid progress of the fortifications, despite all their predictions to the contrary, goaded the Samaritans to frenzy. So they, dreading danger from the growing greatness of the Jews, formed a conspiracy to surprise them, demolish their works, and disperse or intimidate the builders. The plot being discovered, Nehemiah adopted the most energetic measures for ensuring the common safety, as well as the uninterrupted building of the walls. Hitherto the governor, for the sake of despatch, had set all his attendants and guards on the work&#8212;now half of them were withdrawn to be constantly in arms. The workmen labored with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other; and as, in so large a circuit, they were far removed from each other, Nehemiah (who was night and day on the spot, and, by his pious exhortations and example, animated the minds of his people) kept a trumpeter by his side, so that, on any intelligence of a surprise being brought to him, an alarm might be immediately sounded, and assistance rendered to the most distant detachment of their brethren. By these vigilant precautions, the counsels of the enemy were defeated, and the work was carried on apace. God, when He has important public work to do, never fails to raise up instruments for accomplishing it, and in the person of Nehemiah, who, to great natural acuteness and energy added fervent piety and heroic devotion, He provided a leader, whose high qualities fitted him for the demands of the crisis. Nehemiah's vigilance anticipated every difficulty, his prudent measures defeated every obstruction, and with astonishing rapidity this Jerusalem was made again "a city fortified."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">From that time forth, </span> lest our enemies should repeat their enterprise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The half of my servants; </span> of my domestic servants, and of my guards, who should have attended upon my own person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons, </span> i.e. all their weapons; they stood in their arms prepared for battle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The rulers were behind all; </span> partly to encourage them in their work, and sometimes to assist with their own hands; and partly to direct and command them in case of an assault. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The house of Judah, </span> i.e. the Jews who were upon the wall. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass from that time forth,....

They are mentioned again in <span class="ital"><a href="/nehemiah/4-23.htm" title="So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.">Nehemiah 4:23</a></span>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-10.htm" title="I likewise, and my brothers, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.">Nehemiah 5:10</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-16.htm" title="Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither to the work.">Nehemiah 5:16</a>. We gather that only in the case of these his personal attendants did Nehemiah still insist upon arms being held in readiness, while the work of building went on. The rest of the Jews were exempted. Nehemiah’s servants were kept prepared for any emergency. One half of them worked on the wall: the other half were stationed under arms at various points holding the weapons of their comrades.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the</span> other <span class="ital">half of them held both the spears</span>, &c.] R.V. <span class="bld">and half of them held the spears.</span> In the original the copula ‘and’ stands before ‘the spears.’ It has been suggested that this implies the falling out of a word, e.g. ‘the swords’ after which the copula would be natural, i.e. ‘the swords and the spears, &c.’ The interpretation which, accepting the introduction of the word ‘swords,’ begins a new sentence with ‘and the spears, &c.’ is harsh and improbable. But it is best to suppose that the copula has been accidentally inserted from the neighbouring words. The wearing of a sword was not incompatible with the manual work. The weapons held by the non-working detachment are just those which would have rendered work on the wall impossible. Cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/nehemiah/4-18.htm" title="For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.">Nehemiah 4:18</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the spears</span>] The ‘spear’ (<span class="ital">romakh</span>) mentioned here and in <span class="ital"><a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm" title="Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.">Nehemiah 4:13</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-21.htm" title="So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.">Nehemiah 4:21</a></span> seems to have been the principal thrusting weapon. We do not find it anywhere spoken of as a ‘javelin’ to be hurled. It must have been more of the Greek phalanx spear than the ‘pilum’ of the Roman soldier. It is mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/11-12.htm" title="And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-8.htm" title="And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-5.htm" title="Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.">2 Chronicles 25:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-14.htm" title="And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.">2 Chronicles 26:14</a>, in connexion with the armies of the Southern kingdom, in <a href="/jeremiah/46-4.htm" title="Harness the horses; and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.">Jeremiah 46:4</a>, with the forces of Pharaoh-Necho, in <a href="/ezekiel/39-9.htm" title="And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:">Ezekiel 39:9</a>, with the armies of Gog. The same word is used of the weapons with which the prophets of Baal mutilated themselves as they offered sacrifice on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm" title="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.">1 Kings 18:28</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the shields, and the bows</span>] There were two kinds of shields in the armies of the East, the one small and round (‘the buckler’), the other large and oblong. They are mentioned together in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-9.htm" title="Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.">2 Chronicles 23:9</a>; cf. <a href="/context/1_kings/10-16.htm" title="And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target....">1 Kings 10:16-17</a>. Representations of the two kinds may be seen in the Assyrian sculptures. Here the shields are of the smaller kind (magen), and would be used by those who carried spears.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the bows</span>] In the Assyrian bas-reliefs we constantly find ‘bowmen’ attacking a city protected by shield-bearers, and discharging their arrows behind large oblong shields. Here however shooting from behind a rampart, the large shields would not be required.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the habergeons</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and the coats of mail.</span> Cp. also <a href="/2_chronicles/26-14.htm" title="And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.">2 Chronicles 26:14</a>, where the R.V. makes the same alteration. It is unlikely that the common soldiers mentioned in these two passages would have worn heavy and elaborate ‘coats of mail’ such as Saul is described as offering to David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-38.htm" title="And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put an helmet of brass on his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.">1 Samuel 17:38</a>) or Ahab seems to have worn at Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm" title="And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: why he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.">1 Kings 22:34</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-33.htm" title="And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn your hand, that you may carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.">2 Chronicles 18:33</a>). The wearing of ‘scale’ or ‘link’ armour was probably confined to the officers of an army; and it may be doubted whether the soldiers of a provincial governor would have been so fully and expensively equipped.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We should probably understand the defensive armour here mentioned to consist of suits of tough leather doublets, ‘jerkins,’ protecting the body down to the knees and leaving the arms bare. The hard specially prepared hides, of which they were made, were almost impenetrable to the arrow. In some cases no doubt thin ‘scales’ of metal were sewn into the leather, and Nehemiah’s bodyguard would be better armed than the ordinary Jewish citizens. For ‘habergeon’ = a little coat-of-mail covering the head and shoulders, compare (see <span class="ital">Bible Word-Book</span>) Latimer, <span class="ital">Serm.</span>, p. 29, ‘And be ye apparalled or clothed,’ saith Paul, ‘with the habergeon or coat armour of justice.’ The word is used by the A.V. in <a href="/exodus/28-32.htm" title="And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the middle thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.">Exodus 28:32</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-23.htm" title="And there was an hole in the middle of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.">Exodus 39:23</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-14.htm" title="And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.">2 Chronicles 26:14</a>; <a href="/job/41-26.htm" title="The sword of him that lays at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.">Job 41:26</a> It is derived from the French ‘haubergeon’ = neck covering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the rulers</span> were <span class="ital">behind all the house of Judah</span>] so R.V. text; R.V marg., ‘<span class="ital">all the house of Judah that builded the wall.
