The word of God is the sword of the Spirit, which we ought to have always at hand, and never to have to seek for it, either in our labours, or in our conflicts, as Christians. Every true Christian is both a labourer and a soldier, working with one hand, and fighting with the other. Good work is likely to go on with success, when those who labour in it, make a business of it. And Satan fears to assault the watchful Christian; or, if attacked, the Lord fights for him. Thus must we wait to the close of life, never putting off our armour till our work and warfare are ended; then we shall be welcomed to the rest and joy of our Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Habergeons - Or, "coats of mail."

He Sets a Watch.<p>7-21. But &#8230; when Sanballat &#8230; heard that the walls &#8230; were made up, and &#8230; the breaches &#8230; stopped&#8212;The rapid progress of the fortifications, despite all their predictions to the contrary, goaded the Samaritans to frenzy. So they, dreading danger from the growing greatness of the Jews, formed a conspiracy to surprise them, demolish their works, and disperse or intimidate the builders. The plot being discovered, Nehemiah adopted the most energetic measures for ensuring the common safety, as well as the uninterrupted building of the walls. Hitherto the governor, for the sake of despatch, had set all his attendants and guards on the work&#8212;now half of them were withdrawn to be constantly in arms. The workmen labored with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other; and as, in so large a circuit, they were far removed from each other, Nehemiah (who was night and day on the spot, and, by his pious exhortations and example, animated the minds of his people) kept a trumpeter by his side, so that, on any intelligence of a surprise being brought to him, an alarm might be immediately sounded, and assistance rendered to the most distant detachment of their brethren. By these vigilant precautions, the counsels of the enemy were defeated, and the work was carried on apace. God, when He has important public work to do, never fails to raise up instruments for accomplishing it, and in the person of Nehemiah, who, to great natural acuteness and energy added fervent piety and heroic devotion, He provided a leader, whose high qualities fitted him for the demands of the crisis. Nehemiah's vigilance anticipated every difficulty, his prudent measures defeated every obstruction, and with astonishing rapidity this Jerusalem was made again "a city fortified."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people,....

We translate it: Then I placed at the lowest places behind the wall, at the dried-up places, I((even) placed the people, after their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is a stronger expression for &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; when used to indicate position, and &#1502;&#1503; points out the direction. The sense is: at the lowest places from behind the wall. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; gives the nature of the places where the people were placed with arms. &#1510;&#1495;&#1497;&#1495; and &#1510;&#1495;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492; mean a dry or bare place exposed to the heat of the sun: bare, uncovered, or empty places, perhaps bare hills, whence approaching foes might be discerned at a distance. The second &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; is but a reiteration of the verb, for the sake of combining it with its object, from which the &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; at the beginning of the verse was too far removed by the circumstantial description of the locality.<p>(Note: Bertheau considers the text corrupt, regarding the word &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; as the object of &#1488;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, and alters it into &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, engines for hurling missiles (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>), or into &#1502;&#1496;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (a word of this own invention), instruments for hurling. But not only is this conjecture critically inadmissible, it also offers no appropriate sense. The lxx reads the text as we do, and merely renders &#1489;&#1510;&#1495;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; conjecturally by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;. Besides, it is not easy to see how &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; could have arisen from a false reading of &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;; and it should be remembered that &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; does not mean a machine for hurling, while &#1502;&#1496;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; is a mere fabrication. To this must be added, that such machines are indeed placed upon the walls of a fortress to hurl down stones and projectiles upon assaulting foes, and not behind the walls, where they could only be used to demolish the walls, and so facilitate the taking of the town by the enemy.) </body></html>
