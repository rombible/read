God has many ways of bringing to light, and so of bringing to nought, the devices and designs of his church's enemies. If our enemies cannot frighten us from duty, or deceive us into sin, they cannot hurt us. Nehemiah put himself and his cause under the Divine protection. It was the way of this good man, and should be our way. All his cares, all his griefs, all his fears, he spread before God. Before he used any means, he made his prayer to God. Having prayed, he set a watch against the enemy. If we think to secure ourselves by prayer, without watchfulness, we are slothful, and tempt God; if by watchfulness, without prayer, we are proud, and slight God: either way, we forfeit his protection. God's care of our safety, should engage and encourage us to go on with vigour in our duty. As soon as a danger is over, let us return to our work, and trust God another time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Arabians ... - Probably a band, composed largely of Arabians, Ammonites, and Ashdodites, which Sanballat maintained as a guard to his person, and which formed a portion of "the army of Samaria" <a href="/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>. A quarrel between such a band and the people of Jerusalem might be overlooked by the Persian king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 4:7-23.

But &#8230; when Sanballat &#8230; heard that the walls &#8230; were made up, and &#8230; the breaches &#8230; stopped&#8212;The rapid progress of the fortifications, despite all their predictions to the contrary, goaded the Samaritans to frenzy. So they, dreading danger from the growing greatness of the Jews, formed a conspiracy to surprise them, demolish their works, and disperse or intimidate the builders. The plot being discovered, Nehemiah adopted the most energetic measures for ensuring the common safety, as well as the uninterrupted building of the walls. Hitherto the governor, for the sake of despatch, had set all his attendants and guards on the work&#8212;now half of them were withdrawn to be constantly in arms. The workmen labored with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other; and as, in so large a circuit, they were far removed from each other, Nehemiah (who was night and day on the spot, and, by his pious exhortations and example, animated the minds of his people) kept a trumpeter by his side, so that, on any intelligence of a surprise being brought to him, an alarm might be immediately sounded, and assistance rendered to the most distant detachment of their brethren. By these vigilant precautions, the counsels of the enemy were defeated, and the work was carried on apace. God, when He has important public work to do, never fails to raise up instruments for accomplishing it, and in the person of Nehemiah, who, to great natural acuteness and energy added fervent piety and heroic devotion, He provided a leader, whose high qualities fitted him for the demands of the crisis. Nehemiah's vigilance anticipated every difficulty, his prudent measures defeated every obstruction, and with astonishing rapidity this Jerusalem was made again "a city fortified."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And conspired all of them together,....

(Bertheau), for the participle is present, and does not stand for the future; but, What are they doing? The form &#1488;&#1502;&#1500;&#1500;, withered, powerless, occurs here only. The subject of the four succeeding interrogative sentences must be the same. And this is enough to render inadmissible the explanation offered by older expositors of &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;: Will they leave to them, viz., will the neighbouring nations or the royal prefects allow them to build? Here, as in the case of the following verbs, the subject can only be the Jews. Hence Ewald seeks, both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-8.htm">Nehemiah 4:8</a>, to give to the verb &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; the meaning to shelter: Will they make a shelter for themselves, i.e., will they fortify the town? But this is quite arbitrary. Bertheau more correctly compares the passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>, &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, we leave it to God; but incorrectly infers that here also we must supply &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;, and that, Will they leave to themselves? means, Will they commit the matter to God. This mode of completing the sense, however, can by no means be justified; and Bertheau's conjecture, that the Jews now assembling in Jerusalem, before commencing the work itself, instituted a devotional solemnity which Sanballat was ridiculing, is incompatible with the correct rendering of the participle. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; construed with &#1500; means to leave, to commit a matter to any one, like <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>, and the sense is: Will they leave the building of the fortified walls to themselves? i.e., Do they think they are able with their poor resources to carry out this great work? This is appropriately followed by the next question: Will they sacrifice? i.e., bring sacrifices to obtain God's miraculous assistance? The ridicule lies in the circumstance that Sanballat neither credited the Jews with ability to carry out the work, nor believed in the overruling providence of the God whom the Jews worshipped, and therefore casts scorn by &#1492;&#1497;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; both upon the faith of the Jews in their God and upon the living God Himself. As these two questions are internally connected, so also are the two following, by which Sanballat casts a doubt upon the possibility of the work being executed. Will they finish (the work) on this day, i.e., to-day, directly? The meaning is: Is this a matter to be as quickly executed as if it were the work of a single day? The last question is: Have they even the requisite materials? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish which are burnt? The building-stone of Jerusalem was limestone, which gets softened by fire, losing its durability, and, so to speak, its vitality. This explains the use of the verb &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, to revive, bestow strength and durability upon the softened crumbled stones, to fit the stones into a new building (Ges. Lex.). The construction &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is explained by the circumstance that &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is by its form masculine, but by its meaning feminine, and that &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; agrees with the form &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
