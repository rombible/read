Every true Christian is both a labourer and a soldier, working with one hand, and fighting with the other. Good work is likely to go on with success, when those who labour in it, make a business of it. And Satan fears to assault the watchful Christian; or, if attacked, the Lord fights for him.

But &#8230; when Sanballat &#8230; heard that the walls &#8230; were made up, and &#8230; the breaches &#8230; stopped&#8212;The rapid progress of the fortifications, despite all their predictions to the contrary, goaded the Samaritans to frenzy. So they, dreading danger from the growing greatness of the Jews, formed a conspiracy to surprise them, demolish their works, and disperse or intimidate the builders. The plot being discovered, Nehemiah adopted the most energetic measures for ensuring the common safety, as well as the uninterrupted building of the walls. Hitherto the governor, for the sake of despatch, had set all his attendants and guards on the work&#8212;now half of them were withdrawn to be constantly in arms. The workmen labored with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other; and as, in so large a circuit, they were far removed from each other, Nehemiah (who was night and day on the spot, and, by his pious exhortations and example, animated the minds of his people) kept a trumpeter by his side, so that, on any intelligence of a surprise being brought to him, an alarm might be immediately sounded, and assistance rendered to the most distant detachment of their brethren. By these vigilant precautions, the counsels of the enemy were defeated, and the work was carried on apace. God, when He has important public work to do, never fails to raise up instruments for accomplishing it, and in the person of Nehemiah, who, to great natural acuteness and energy added fervent piety and heroic devotion, He provided a leader, whose high qualities fitted him for the demands of the crisis. Nehemiah's vigilance anticipated every difficulty, his prudent measures defeated every obstruction, and with astonishing rapidity this Jerusalem was made again "a city fortified."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">None of us put off our clothes; </span> neither by day, nor by night, as the manner is when we go to bed; they constantly kept themselves in a readiness for fighting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saving that every one put them off for washing; </span> when they were to wash and cleanse themselves from some natural or moral impurity, which might befall them or their garments. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So neither I, nor my brethren,....

These shared their leader’s vigilance and imitated his endurance. Not one of them put off his clothes the whole time that the building went on. They were prepared for an attack at any moment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘brethren.’ These would be the relatives of Nehemiah, cf. <a href="/nehemiah/1-2.htm" title="That Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 1:2</a>. The whole house or clan to which he belonged staunchly supported him throughout the crisis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘servants’ … ‘men of the guard which followed me.’ Under these two heads Nehemiah seems to describe those whom he has mentioned in <span class="ital"><a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm" title="They which built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.">Nehemiah 4:17</a></span> as ‘my servants.’ He distinguishes here between his personal attendants consisting of Jewish retainers, and the bodyguard consisting chiefly of foreigners allotted him as governor by the Persian king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>saving that <span class="ital">every one put them off for washing</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">every one</span> went with <span class="bld">his weapon to the water.</span> R.V. marg. ‘The text is probably faulty.’ The clause has occasioned great difficulty. Literally rendered the words run, ‘each one his weapon the water.’ The LXX. omit the words, probably from inability to discover their meaning. The error in the text is therefore of very early date. The Syriac seems to have conjectured ‘days’ for ‘water.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) The A.V. follows the conjecture of the Vulg. ‘unusquisque tantum nudabatur ad baptismum,’ according to which the Hebrew word for ‘his weapon’ becomes by a change of vocalization a verb = ‘they sent (i.e. cast off) each one his clothes for the water,’ i.e. in order to wash. The Hebrew however could not possibly bear this very strained interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) Another old rendering <span class="bld">is</span> ‘each one his weapon was (in the place of, or equivalent to) water,’ i.e. ‘instead of washing they had each to stand fast to their arms,’ is equally improbable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) Another rendering ‘each one had (by his side) his weapon (and) his (draught of) water’ gives intelligible sense, but not such as can be justified by the original.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">d</span>) Ewald’s rendering, ‘the taking off of each man’s clothes was for water,’ i.e. ‘to satisfy his necessities, not to lie down to rest,’ seems very uncalled for. It is greatly to be questioned whether Nehemiah even ‘in his rough and open style’ would have introduced such an allusion or in such words. (Ewald, <span class="ital">Hist. of Isr.</span> vol. v. p. 156, note 1, Eng. Transl.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">e</span>) Some moderns rendering ‘his weapon’ (shil’kho) as if it were the verb (shâl’khû) translate ‘they sent each one for water.’ They could not leave their post, and had to have the necessaries of life brought to them where they stood. This use of ‘send’ as equivalent to ‘send for,’ is scarcely supported by <a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm" title="And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.">2 Samuel 15:12</a>, since here a thing and not a person is the object of the verb. Others, reading ‘shâl’khû, render, ‘Every one gave up the use of water,’ a quite inadmissible translation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">f</span>) The R.V. rendering which introduces the words ‘went with … to’ makes good sense of the clause, but follows very unnaturally upon ‘none of us put off our clothes,’ neither stating an exception nor introducing a cognate idea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">g</span>) A good conjectural emendation of the text gives the sense ‘each one remained with his weapon in his hand’ (or ‘in his right hand’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">h</span>) But it is probable that the error of the text is due to the accidental omission of certain words. We expect some statement of the <span class="ital">length of time</span> during which Nehemiah and his followers continued without retiring to rest. Perhaps the clause may have run ‘each one with his weapon in his hand for a full month of days.’ The Syriac version ‘we will not put off our clothes during a month of days’ agrees with this suggestion, and the Arabic gives a similar rendering, ‘till the end of a month and days.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My brethren</span>.

That Nehemiah had brothers appears from <a href="/nehemiah/1-2.htm">Nehemiah 1:2</a>; that one of them, Hanani, had accompanied him to Jerusalem is evident from <a href="/nehemiah/7-2.htm">Nehemiah 7:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">My servants</span>.

So the Vulgate: "Unnsquisque tantum nudabatur ad baptismum;" but it is at least doubtful whether the Hebrew words can possibly have this meaning. The most natural and literal sense of them is that given by Maurer and Rambach - "Each man's weapon was his water;" the supposed connection of the clause with the preceding being, "No one took off his clothes," not even for the bath  - no one bathed; "a man's only bath was his weapon." Some critics, however, defend the rendering of the A. V.; others take the words in the same way, but explain the term "water" differently, of a natural want (Ewald, Stanley); while many regard the text as unsound, and propose emendations. None, however, that has as yet been proposed is satisfactory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From that day the half of my servants wrought at the work, and the other half of them held the spears and shields, the bows and the armour, i.e., carried the arms.

"The rulers were behind all the house of Judah," i.e., each was behind his own people who were employed on the work, to encourage them in their labour, and, in case of attack, to lead them against the enemy. - In <a href="/nehemiah/4-11.htm">Nehemiah 4:11</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is prefixed after the manner of a title. With respect to those who built the wall, both the bearers of burdens were lading with the one hand of each workman, and holding a weapon with the other, and the builders were building each with his sword girt on his side.

The builders, on the contrary, needed both hands for their work: hence they had swords girt to their sides. "And he that sounded the trumpet was beside me." Nehemiah, as superintendent of the work, stood at the head of his servants, ready to ward off any attack; hence the trumpeter was beside him, to be able to give to those employed on the wall the signal for speedy muster in case danger should threaten.</body></html>
