The title ‘the people of the land’ (’am haârec̣) was used in later days of the unlearned multitude ‘which knoweth not the law’ (<a href="/john/7-49.htm" title="But this people who knows not the law are cursed.">John 7:49</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ware</span>] The Hebrew word occurs only here in the O.T.

But it represents the natural expansion of the command to keep the Sabbath holy. Pollution would most easily be contracted by the interchange of wares with the heathen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Complete abstention from such occupation was the only safeguard for the purity of the people, as well as for the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest, cf. <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm" title="In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.">Nehemiah 13:15</a>. This abstention was practised in the kingly period in respect of the sabbath and the new-moon days. <a href="/amos/8-5.htm" title="Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?">Amos 8:5</a>, ‘When will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on the holy day</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">on a holy day.</span> The days set apart to be observed as ‘holy-days’ are described in Numbers 28, 31.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That these were to be observed as ‘days of rest,’ and were thus on the same footing with the Sabbath-days argues the acquaintance of the writer with the Levitical Law of the Priestly Code.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">leave</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">forgo.</span> The same word that is used in <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm" title="But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie still; that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.

But the Priestly Law in <a href="/context/leviticus/25-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD....">Leviticus 25:2-7</a> enters with some minuteness into the agricultural ‘rest’ of the seventh year. This regulation was not, for practical reasons, scrupulously carried out; its neglect is the subject of rebuke, <a href="/context/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths....">Leviticus 26:34-35</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-43.htm" title="The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.">Leviticus 26:43</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm" title="To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years.">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>. It seems to have been observed in later times, cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-49.htm" title="But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for they came out of the city, because they had no victuals there to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land.">1Ma 6:49</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-53.htm" title="Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;)">1Ma 6:53</a>; Jos. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xi. 8. 6, xiii. 8. 1, &c. Tacitus, who is prejudiced against the Jews, attributes the custom to national laziness, <span class="ital">Hist.</span> <a href="/nehemiah/10-4.htm" title="Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,">Nehemiah 10:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the exaction of every debt</span>] This is a technical expression taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/15-2.htm" title="And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends ought to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>, and constitutes the expansion, for the requirements of a more developed time, of the principle laid down in the agricultural Law of the Sabbatic Year (Exodus 23). By a common error it has been supposed that debts were on this year altogether remitted. The analogy of the ‘fallow’ land shows that the debts remained, but were not exacted; payment was ‘hung up’ for a whole year. Some render ‘the exaction of every man’s pledge.’ The versions are literal, LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀπαίτησιν πάσης χειρός</span>. Vulg. ‘exactionem universae manus.’ The remission of ‘the exaction of debt’ on the seventh or Sabbatic year is found in the Deuteronomic, but not in the Levitical Laws. The covenant to which the Israelites were now subscribing did not rest on a Levitical code alone, but recognised the authority of other portions of the Pentateuch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is one indication among others that the Law, which Ezra administered, contained substantially all the component parts of our Pentateuch, though not necessarily every item, as we now have it, in each component part.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the people of the land bring ware ...  on the sabbath</span>. If the heathen of this region will insist on bringing their wares into our cities and offering them for immediate sale on the sabbath, we Jews bind ourselves not to deal with them on that day. Subsequently, Nehemiah carried out more stringent regulations (<a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15-22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or on the holy day</span>. Rather, "or on a holy day."

This precept of the law had been frequently neglected during the times of the monarchy, and its neglect was one of the sins which the captivity was expressly intended to punish (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). It now appears that after the return the precept had been again disobeyed. <span class="cmt_word">The exaction of every debt.</span> Literally, "the pledge of every hand."
