Something of this kind seems to have occurred in the wilderness, when God's law was first given to his people (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-12.htm">Deuteronomy 29:12</a>); and therefore, when renewals of the covenant were made, and the people were required to ratify the act, it was natural to recur to the old sanction, An oath was probably taken of the people in the time of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>), when they are said to have "stood to the covenant." <span class="cmt_word">Moses the servant of God</span>. The epithet "servant of God," or "servant of the Lord," attaches to Moses in a peculiar way.

The rest are names either of the heads of the different houses into which these kindreds were divided, or of the elders of the smaller towns of Benjamin and Judah. The fact that, while only thirty-three kindreds and placed are enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, forty-four occur here, - although names of kindreds mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, e.g., Shephatiah, Arah, Zaccai, etc., are wanting here, - is to be explained partly by the circumstance that these kindreds included several houses whose different heads all subscribed, and partly by fresh accessions during the course of years to the number of houses. </body></html>
