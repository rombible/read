Then follow (in vv. 3-9) twenty-one names, with the addition: these, the priests. Of these twenty-one names, fifteen occur in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-2.htm">Nehemiah 12:2-7</a> as chiefs of the priests who came up with Joshua and Zerubbabel from Babylon, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-11.htm">Nehemiah 12:11-20</a> as heads of priestly houses. Hence it is obvious that all the twenty-one names are those of heads of priestly classes, who signed the agreement in the names of the houses and families of their respective classes. Seraiah is probably the prince of the house of God dwelling at Jerusalem, mentioned <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>, who signed in place of the high priest.
