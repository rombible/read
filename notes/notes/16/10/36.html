We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well. Let not any people expect the blessing of God, unless they keep up public worship. It is likely to go well with our houses, when care is taken that the work of God's house goes on well. When every one helps, and every one gives, though but little, toward a good work, the whole will come to be a large sum. We must do what we can in works of piety and charity; and whatever state we are placed in, cheerfully perform our duty to God, which will be the surest way to ease and liberty. As the ordinances of God are the appointed means of support to our souls, the believer will not grudge the expense; yet most people leave their souls to starve.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No special provision was made by the Law, by David, or by Solomon, for the supply of wood necessary to keep fire ever burning upon the altar. Nehemiah established a system by which the duty of supplying the wood was laid as a burden in turn on the various clans or families, which were regarded as constituting the nation. The lot was used to determine the order in which the several families should perform the duty. A special day (the 14th of the fifth month, according to Josephus) was appointed for the bringing in of the supply; and this day was after a time regarded as a high festival, and called "the feast of the wood-offering." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. we cast the lots &#8230; for the wood offering&#8212;The carrying of the wood had formerly been the work of the Nethinims.

"The rest of the people, the priests," etc., are the members of the community, exclusive of the princes and heads of the priestly and Levitical orders. The Nethinim, to whom belonged the servants of Solomon (see rem. on <a href="/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43</a>.), were probably also represented in the assembly by the heads of the Levites. To these are added all who had separated themselves, etc., i.e., the descendants of those Israelites who had been left in the land, and who now joined the new community; see rem. on <a href="/ezra/6-21.htm">Ezra 6:21</a>.

We hence perceive the tenor of the agreement entered into and sealed by the princes.

Besides the general obligation to observe all the commandments, judgments, and statutes of God, two points, then frequently transgressed, are specially mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/10-23.htm">Nehemiah 10:23</a>. In <a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a> : that we would not give our daughters to the people of the lands, etc.; see rem. on <a href="/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>.

To the sanctification of the Sabbath pertained the celebration of the sabbatical year, which is therefore named immediately afterwards. The words &#1492;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, to let the seventh year lie, i.e., in the seventh year to let the land lie untilled and unsown, is an abbreviation taken from the language of the law, <a href="/exodus/28-10.htm">Exodus 28:10</a>. &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491; &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488; also depends upon &#1504;&#1496;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;.
