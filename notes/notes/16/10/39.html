Nehemiah established a system by which the duty of supplying the wood was laid as a burden in turn on the various clans or families, which were regarded as constituting the nation. The lot was used to determine the order in which the several families should perform the duty. A special day (the 14th of the fifth month, according to Josephus) was appointed for the bringing in of the supply; and this day was after a time regarded as a high festival, and called "the feast of the wood-offering." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. and we will not forsake the house of our God&#8212;This solemn pledge was repeated at the close of the covenant as an expression of the intense zeal by which the people at this time were animated for the glory and the worship of God.

From this combination we might conclude (1) that the Levitical community, with the exception of the ‘porters’ and ‘singers,’ were for the most part in Nehemiah’s time not resident at Jerusalem, but quartered in the country districts, cf. <a href="/nehemiah/11-20.htm" title="And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.">Nehemiah 11:20</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/12-27.htm" title="And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.">Nehemiah 12:27</a>; (2) that the porters and singers participated with the priests in the offerings of the people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we will not forsake</span>] The object of the new regulations is to maintain the efficiency of the Temple worship and to provide for the welfare of those that ministered in it; ‘we will not forsake’ is equivalent to ‘we will not neglect or diminish the contributions to the Temple, which we have publicly undertaken.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note on ‘the Tithe.’ It must be noticed that ‘the tithe’ spoken of in this context is described as ‘tithes of our ground,’ ‘tithes in all the cities of our tillage,’ and is probably here (<a href="/nehemiah/10-39.htm" title="For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, to the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.">Nehemiah 10:39</a>) represented along with ‘the heave offering,’ as consisting of corn, wine and oil, as indeed it is spoken of in <a href="/nehemiah/13-5.htm" title="And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.">Nehemiah 13:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-12.htm" title="Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.">Nehemiah 13:12</a>. In other words ‘the tithe’ is a vegetable one; and this is also the impression which we gather from the description of ‘tithe’ in Numbers 18 and <a href="/context/malachi/3-8.htm" title="Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me. But you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings....">Malachi 3:8-11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now in <a href="/context/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD....">Leviticus 27:32-33</a> ‘a tithe of the herd or the flock’ is called ‘holy to the Lord,’ and with this agrees the mention of ‘the tithe of oxen and sheep’ in <a href="/2_chronicles/31-6.htm" title="And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelled in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.">2 Chronicles 31:6</a>. It is needless to point out what an enormous addition this ‘tithe of the herd or the flock’ would make to the wealth of the Priesthood and the treasury of the Temple. How then does it come to pass that neither in the regulations contained in Numbers 18 and Deuteronomy 14, nor in Nehemiah 10, 12, 13 is any allusion made to the tithe of herd and flock? Two explanations are forthcoming:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) It is possible that <a href="/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:32</a> embodies a primitive pastoral law of tithing, which having fallen into desuetude was omitted at the time of the codification of the laws in Numbers 18 and Deuteronomy 14. In support of this view it should be remembered that Jacob’s vow to dedicate a tenth (<a href="/genesis/28-22.htm" title="And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.">Genesis 28:22</a>) certainly referred to the tithe of property in herds and flocks, while the possibility of exacting a ‘tenth’ of the flocks even for civil purposes is contemplated in <a href="/1_samuel/8-17.htm" title="He will take the tenth of your sheep: and you shall be his servants.">1 Samuel 8:17</a>. According to this view, Hezekiah would have revived a religious custom, which was inherited from the time when the nation was more pastoral than agricultural. It is natural to suppose that the Jewish community at Jerusalem in Nehemiah’s days was too poor to maintain this additional burden. The objection to this explanation is that the appearance of <a href="/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:32</a> in relation to its immediate context is not that of a survival from an earlier legislation; while the children of Israel could never have so far abandoned the pastoral in favour of agricultural life as to make it worth while to surrender the claim to so important a source of revenue for the service of the Temple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) It is possible, as is maintained in some quarters, that ‘the animal tithe-law’ of <a href="/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:32</a> may be an interpolation later than Nehemiah’s time, made in the interest of the Priesthood. There is more to be said for this startling supposition than might perhaps be expected. A close inspection of <a href="/context/leviticus/27-30.htm" title="And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy to the LORD....">Leviticus 27:30-33</a> shows that <a href="/nehemiah/10-32.htm" title="Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;">Nehemiah 10:32</a> is strangely and abruptly introduced between <a href="/nehemiah/10-31.htm" title="And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.">Nehemiah 10:31</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/10-33.htm" title="For the show bread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.">Nehemiah 10:33</a>, which deal with the subject of the redemption of the vegetable-tithe mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/10-30.htm" title="And that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land, not take their daughters for our sons:">Nehemiah 10:30</a>. Again, in 2 Chronicles 31 we find that, after the mention in <a href="/nehemiah/10-5.htm" title="Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,">Nehemiah 10:5</a> of ‘tithe of all things’ being given by ‘the children of Israel’, another sentence (<a href="/nehemiah/10-6.htm" title="Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,">Nehemiah 10:6</a>) tells us that ‘the children of Israel and Judah that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of consecrated things, &c.’ which is not improbably a later expansion of the previous words. It is obviously an objection to this view that the insertion of a clause making so large a claim upon the property of the Jews could rarely at any time have been secretly foisted into the text of the Pentateuch; and that, supposing it to have been possible, such an interpolation made in the interest of the Priestly families would have had the smallest chance of success at a time when the Scribes controlled the transcription of the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The solution of the problem has not yet been reached. The difficulty illustrates the variations in Israelite law, in which are reflected the altered circumstances of different centuries. It must be admitted that <a href="/leviticus/27-32.htm" title="And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:32</a> wears an appearance not altogether free from suspicion; and an interpolation in an age, when, as we know from the LXX. version, the text of the Pentateuch was not yet fully settled, is not outside the range of probability.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering.</span> The priests were not to be troubled with the conveyance of any of the offerings. The first-fruits and other oblations of the people were to be brought to the temple by the people themselves; and the "tithe of the tithe,' which was the priests' due, by the Levites. Thus the priests would not be drawn away from their duty of ministering in the temple by secular employments and matters of mere worldly business. <span class="cmt_word">We will not forsake, or neglect, the house of our God</span>. We will not suffer, that is, any interruption of the continual service of the temple, we will not be parties to any neglect or slovenliness in the conduct of it. So far as we are concerned, everything shall be done to enable the priests and Levites to remain constantly at Jerusalem in full numbers, and to devote themselves wholly to their sacred duties in God's house. With this emphatic declaration of their intentions the people concluded the engagements by which they voluntarily bound themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-34.htm">Nehemiah 10:34-40</a>)<p>Agreement to provide for the expenses of the temple and its ministers. - If the community seriously intended to walk by the rule of God's law, they must take care that the temple service, as the public worship of the community, should be provided for according to the law and a firm footing and due solemnity thus given to religion. For this purpose, it was indispensable to guarantee the contributions prescribed for the necessary expenses of the temple worship, and the support of its ministers. Hence this entering into a solemn agreement to observe the law was regarded as a suitable occasion for regulating the services prescribed by the law with respect to the temple and its ministers, and mutually binding themselves to their observance.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-33.htm">Nehemiah 10:33-34</a><p>We ordained for ourselves (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, upon us, inasmuch as such things are spoken of as are taken upon one). &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1514;&#1514;, to lay upon ourselves the third part of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God. It is not said who were to be bound to furnish this contribution, but it is assumed that it was a well-known custom. This appointed payment is evidently only a revival of the Mosaic precept, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>, that every man of twenty years of age and upwards should give half a shekel as a &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; to the Lord, - a tribute which was still paid in Christ's days, <a href="/matthew/17-24.htm">Matthew 17:24</a>. In consideration, however, of the poverty of the greater portion of the community, it was now lowered to a third of a shekel. The view of Aben Ezra, that a third of a shekel was to be paid in addition to the half shekel levied in conformity with the law, is unsupported by the text. &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492;, the service of the house of God, is not the building and repairs of the temple, but the regular worship. For, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-34.htm">Nehemiah 10:34</a>, the tax was to be applied to defraying the expenses of worship, to supplying the shew-bread, the continual meat and burnt offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-8</a>), the sacrifices for the Sabbaths, new moons (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9-15</a>), and festivals (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-16.htm">Numbers 28:16-29</a>, 38), - for the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, holy gifts, by which, from their position between the burnt-offering and the sin-offering, we may understand the thank-offerings, which were offered in the name of the congregation, as e.g., the two lambs at Pentecost, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-19.htm">Leviticus 23:19</a>, and the offerings brought at feasts of dedication, comp. <a href="/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/6-17.htm">Ezra 6:17</a>, - for the sin-offerings which were sacrificed at every great festival; and finally for all the work of the house of our God, i.e., whatever else was needful for worship (&#1500; must be supplied from the context before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;). The establishment of such a tax for the expenses of worship, does not justify the view that the contributions promised by Artaxerxes in his edict, <a href="/ezra/7-20.htm">Ezra 7:20</a>., of things necessary to worship had ceased, and that the congregation had now to defray the expenses from their own resources. For it may readily be supposed, that besides the assistance afforded by the king, the congregation might also esteem it needful to furnish a contribution, to meet the increased requirements of worship, and thus to augment the revenues of the temple, - the royal alms being limited to a certain amount (see <a href="/ezra/7-22.htm">Ezra 7:22</a>).</body></html>
