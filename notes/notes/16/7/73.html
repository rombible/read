Very similar words occur in <a href="/ezra/3-1.htm" title="And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.">Ezra 3:1</a> after the register of names. The close of the ‘register’ perhaps contained suitable words with which to resume the narrative in both passages. But possibly the Compiler consciously repeats himself and borrows from <a href="/ezra/3-1.htm" title="And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.">Ezra 3:1</a>, ‘the seventh month.’ The mention of this date raises the question of the chronology of the following episodes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The year is not stated. It is not therefore possible to say with certainty that the events described in chap. 8. followed immediately upon the completion of the wall. But, although not stated, this is what is clearly suggested by the compiler of the work. The mention of the 25th of the 6th month (<a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm" title="So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.">Nehemiah 6:15</a>) is followed by the narrative of the 1st of the 7th month (<a href="/nehemiah/7-73.htm" title="So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelled in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.">Nehemiah 7:73</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm" title="And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.">Nehemiah 8:2</a>). As no other year is mentioned, presumably the events are those which occurred in the same year.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The objection which has been raised against this simple view is chiefly based upon the difficulty caused by the strangely sudden reappearance of Ezra. The fact that in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/9-37.htm" title="And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel, dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of the seventh month: so the children of Israel were in their habitations.">1Es 9:37</a> ff. the events here described follow immediately upon the expulsion of ‘the strange women’ (Ezra 9) has been by some scholars understood to supply the right order of time. The public reading of the law and the sacred covenant would then have to be placed in the year 457, and ‘the seventh month’ in the second year after Ezra’s arrival. An apparent confirmation of this view is given by Josephus. But the chronology of Josephus in this period is very untrustworthy. Undoubtedly following 1 Esdras, which does not mention Nehemiah, he places Ezra’s activity in the generation before that of Nehemiah, and Ezra’s death before Nehemiah’s arrival at Jerusalem. His treatment of their lives seems to be based on the supposition that they were not contemporaries (see Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span>, xi. 5); in § 1, Ezra appears as a contemporary of Joiakim the High-priest, in § 5 his death is mentioned as occurring at the same time as that of Joiakim the High-priest, who was succeeded by Eliashib. It seems fatal to this view that, in order to maintain it, it is necessary to strike out, as later glosses, the mention of Nehemiah’s name in <a href="/nehemiah/8-9.htm" title="And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.">Nehemiah 8:9</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/10-1.htm" title="Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,">Nehemiah 10:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 73.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all Israel dwelt in their cities</span>. The document found by Nehemiah (ver. 5) probably ended with these words (romp. <a href="/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>); and ch. 7. should here terminate, as it does in the Septuagint. Having completed the account of what happened in the sixth month, Elul (ch. 6:15), and transcribed the register which he had the good fortune to discover at that date, Nehemiah proceeds to relate events belonging to the seventh month. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And God put into my heart, i.e., God inspired me with the resolution; comp. <a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>.
