I gave my brother Hanani &#8230; charge over Jerusalem&#8212;If, as is commonly supposed, Nehemiah was now contemplating a return to Shushan according to his promise, it was natural that he should wish to entrust the custody of Jerusalem and the management of its civic affairs to men on whose ability, experience, and fidelity, he could confide. Hanani, a near relative (Ne 1:2), was one, and with him was associated, as colleague, Hananiah, "the ruler of the palace"&#8212;that is, the marshal or chamberlain of the viceregal court, which Nehemiah had maintained in Jerusalem. The high religious principle, as well as the patriotic spirit of those two men, recommended them as pre-eminently qualified for being invested with an official trust of such peculiar importance.<p>and feared God above many&#8212;The piety of Hananiah is especially mentioned as the ground of his eminent fidelity in the discharge of all his duties and, consequently, the reason of the confidence which Nehemiah reposed in him; for he was fully persuaded that Hananiah's fear of God would preserve him from those temptations to treachery and unfaithfulness which he was likely to encounter on the governor's departure from Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hanani; </span> of whom see <span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/1-2.htm" title="That Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 1:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The ruler of the palace, </span> i.e. of Nehemiah’s court; justly so called, because he lived in great splendour, and like a viceroy, though it was wholly at his own charge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Charge over Jerusalem, </span> to preserve its peace and safety, and to take particular care of the shutting the gates of the city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He was a faithful man, </span> to wit, Hananiah last mentioned; for it was needless to say any thing in commendation of Hanani, who had shown his piety and zeal for God and his country, in taking a tedious journey from Jerusalem to Shushan, to inform Nehemiah of the sad estate of Jerusalem, and to implore his helping hand to relieve it, <span class="bld">Ne 1</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A faithful man; </span> he chose not magistrates and officers out of any partial or carnal respects to his own kindred, or acquaintance, or favourites, but from true piety and prudence, such as were fittest for and would be most faithful in their employments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And feared God:</span> this is added as the ground and reason, both why he was faithful, and why Nehemiah put such trust and confidence in him, because he knew that the fear of God would keep him from yielding to those temptations to perfidiousness which he was likely to meet with when Nehemiah was gone, and against which a man destitute of God’s fear hath no sufficient fence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Above many; </span> more than most men did; or, above the common pitch of piety. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That I gave my brother Hanani,....

The ‘governor of the castle’ would be an official of great importance, being probably in command of troops for the purpose of keeping order in the city. ‘He’ refers to Hananiah.

According to this statement, it must have been begun on the third day of the fifth month (Ab). The year is not mentioned, the before-named (<a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>) twentieth year of Artaxerxes being intended. This agrees with the other chronological statements of this book. For, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>, it was in Nisan (the first month) of this year that Nehemiah entreated permission of the king to go to Jerusalem; and we learn from <a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a> that he was governor in Jerusalem from the twentieth year onwards, and must therefore have set out for that place immediately after receiving the royal permission. In this case, he might well arrive in Jerusalem before the expiration of the fourth month. He then surveyed the wall, and called a public assembly for the purpose of urging the whole community to enter heartily upon the work of restoration (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Nehemiah 2:11-17</a>). All this might take place in the course of the fourth month, so that the work could be actually taken in hand in the fifth. Nor is there any reasonable ground, as Bertheau has already shown, for doubting the correctness of the statement, that the building was completed in fifty-two days, and (with Ewald) altering the fifty-two days into two years and four months.<p>(Note: Ewald, Gesch. iv. p. 178, thinks that traces of the correct reading of this verse are found in the statement of Josephus, Ant. xi. 5. 7f., that the wall of Jerusalem was finished in two years and four months, and that the word &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; may have been omitted from <a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15</a> by an ancient clerical error, though he is obliged to admit that Josephus in other instances gives no trustworthy dates concerning Nehemiah, whom he makes arrive at Jerusalem in the twenty-fifth, and complete the wall in the twenty-eight year of Xerxes. On the other hand, Bertheau has already remarked, that even if &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; is supplied, no agreement with the statement of Josephus is obtained, since the question still remains how four months can be made out of fifty-two days, or vice versa, fifty-two days of four months. In fact, it is vain to seek for any common ground on which these two different statements can be harmonized; and hence the two years and four months of Josephus can scarcely be regarded as furnishing traces of another reading of the text.)<p>For we must in this case consider, 1st, the necessity for hastening the work repeatedly pointed out by Nehemiah; 2nd, the zeal and relatively very large number of builders - the whole community, both the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Jericho, Tekoa, Gibeon, Mizpah, etc. having combined their efforts; 3rd, that the kind of exertion demanded by such laborious work and unintermitted watchfulness as are described <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/4.htm">Nehemiah 4</a>, though it might be continued for fifty-two days, could scarcely endure during a longer period; and lastly, the amount of the work itself, which must not be regarded as the rebuilding of the whole wall, but only as the restoration of those portions that had been destroyed, the repair of the breaches (<a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a>), and of the ruined gates, - a large portion of wall and at least one gate having remained uninjured.). To this must be added that the material, so far as stone was concerned, was close at hand, stone needing for the most part to be merely brought out of the ruins; besides which, materials of all kind might have been collected and prepared beforehand. It is, moreover, incorrect to compute the extent of this fortified wall by the extent of the wall of modern Jerusalem.</body></html>
