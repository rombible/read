This is added as the ground and reason, both why he was faithful, and why Nehemiah put such confidence in him, because he knew that the fear of God would keep him from yielding to those temptations to perfidiousness which he was likely to meet with when Nehemiah was departed, and against which a man destitute of God’s fear had no sufficient defence. Thus Nehemiah chose magistrates and officers, not out of any partial and carnal respects to his own kindred, or acquaintance, or favourites, but from true piety and prudence, fixing on such as were most fit for, and would be most faithful in their employments.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-4 Nehemiah, having finished the wall, returned to the Persian court, and came to Jerusalem again with a new commission.

Those who were responsible for the doors are mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm" title="Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel.">Nehemiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-3.htm" title="But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-6.htm" title="Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:6</a>; <a href="/context/nehemiah/3-13.htm" title="The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung gate....">Nehemiah 3:13-15</a>. Nehemiah’s completion of the great work is celebrated by the son of Sirach, ‘And among the elect was Neemias whose renown is great, who raised up for us the walls that were fallen, and set up the gates and the bars, and raised up our ruins again’ (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/49-13.htm" title="And among the elect was Neemias, whose renown is great, who raised up for us the walls that were fallen, and set up the gates and the bars, and raised up our ruins again.">Sir 49:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the porters and the singers and the Levites</span>] The ‘porters’ were a guild whose ordinary duty it was to guard the entrances and defences of the <span class="ital">Temple</span>. In the unsettled state of affairs, when he was in constant expectation of attacks from without, and was conscious of intrigues going on within the walls, Nehemiah entrusted the protection of the whole city to this body of trained ‘police,’ and augmented their force by other available trained bands, i.e. the musicians and the main body of Levites, who assisted the priests in the Temple services. The mention of ‘the Levites’ generally <span class="ital">after</span> that of the two special classes is noticeable, but in some measure they were regarded in Nehemiah’s time as distinct, cf. <a href="/nehemiah/12-47.htm" title="And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them to the children of Aaron.">Nehemiah 12:47</a>, <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-5.htm" title="And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests....">Nehemiah 13:5-10</a>. They were already a disciplined and organised set of men. The great majority could apparently be relied on to support the policy of Nehemiah and Ezra. Nehemiah put the keeping of the walls into their hand, with the duty of superintending the watch, and of organising a system of sentinel-work among the citizens themselves (<span class="ital"><a href="/nehemiah/7-3.htm" title="And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.">Nehemiah 7:3</a></span>). The fact that Nehemiah thus trusted these Levites, and Temple servants, indicates that they sympathised with him in his scheme of a religious constitution for the Jews, which would completely exclude the Samaritan and the foreigner.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The porters and the singers and the Levites</span>. The porters and the singers were themselves Levites, but are often distinguished from their brethren, who had no such special office (see <a href="/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40-42, 70</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-24.htm">Ezra 7:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23, 24</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-43.htm">Nehemiah 7:43-45, 73</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-28.htm">Nehemiah 10:28</a>, etc.). Nehemiah's choice of Levites to guard the gates of Jerusalem may seem strange; but we must remember - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the priests and Levites formed nearly one half the population of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/11-6.htm">Nehemiah 11:6-19</a> compared with <a href="/1_chronicles/9-9.htm">1 Chronicles 9:9-22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the office of guarding the temple gates had always been discharged by Levites (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17-22</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12-19</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"On this account was he hired that I might be afraid, and do so; and if I had sinned (by entering the holy place), it (my sin) would have been to them for an evil report, that they might defame me." The use of &#1500;&#1502;&#1488;&#1503; before two sentences, the second of which expresses the purpose of the first, is peculiar: for this purpose, that I might fear, etc., was he hired. To enter and to shut himself within the holy place would have been a grave desecration of the house of God, which would have given occasion to his enemies to cast suspicion upon Nehemiah as a despiser of God's commands, and so to undermine his authority with the people. - In <a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a> Nehemiah concludes his account of the stratagems of his enemies, with the wish that God would think upon them according to their works. In expressing it, he names, besides Tobiah and Sanballat, the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who, like Shemaiah, would have put him in fear: whence we perceive, 1st, that the case related (<a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm">Nehemiah 6:10-13</a>) is given as only one of the chief events of the kind (&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, like <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/6-19.htm">Nehemiah 6:19</a>); and 2nd, that false prophets were again busy in the congregation, as in the period preceding the captivity, and seeking to seduce the people from hearkening to the voice of the true prophets of God, who preached repentance and conversation as the conditions of prosperity. </body></html>
