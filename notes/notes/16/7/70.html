He was the tirshatha, or governor, and the liberality displayed by him and some of the leading men for the suitable equipment of the ministers of religion, forms the subject of the remaining portion of the chapter. Their donations consisted principally in garments. This would appear a singular description of gifts to be made by any one among us; but, in the East, a present of garments, or of any article of use, is conformable to the prevailing sentiments and customs of society.<p>drams of gold&#8212;that is, darics.

Zerubbabel was Tirshatha when the Jews came out of Babylon, and Nehemiah now: <p>fifty basins; which were vessels, in the which the blood of the sacrifices was received and out of which it was sprinkled: <p>five hundred and thirty priests' garments; which were laid up in the wardrobe, and used on occasion. <p>(d) Melpomene, sive, l. 4. c. 166.

This is additional to the information contained in Ezra, who does not separate Zerubbabel's offering from that of the other heads of families (Nehemiah 2:69).
