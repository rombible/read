The original register of Zerubbabelis found and copied. The express language of both Ezra and Nehemiah makes it plain that this is no other than the list of those who came up with Zerubbabel and Joshua after the decree of Cyrus, in B.C. 538. Nehemiah’s own census follows, in Nehemiah 11.

The author of the <span class="ital">Universal History </span>observes, that though the genealogies had been once rectified, soo after the return, there were still many families of priests, Levites, and people, who could not make out their claim to their tribes. It is therefore likely that some of them were afterward enabled to do it, and were then inserted in this new register, together with those who came up with Nehemiah. Several of the old families, which came up on the first edict, might be, by this time, extinct, and these are the probable causes of the difference we find in the genealogies of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:5-73 Nehemiah knew that the safety of a city, under God, depends more upon the inhabitants than upon its walls.

Genealogy of Those Who Came at the First Out of Babylon.<p>5. my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, &c.&#8212;The arrangement about to be described, though dictated by mere common prudence, is, in accordance with the pious feelings of Nehemiah, ascribed not to his own prudence or reflection, but to the grace of God prompting and directing him. He resolved to prepare a register of the returned exiles, containing an exact record of the family and ancestral abode of every individual. While thus directing his attention, he discovered a register of the first detachment who had come under the care of Zerubbabel. It is transcribed in the following verses, and differs in some few particulars from that given in Ezr 2:1-61. But the discrepancy is sufficiently accounted for from the different circumstances in which the two registers were taken; that of Ezra having been made up at Babylon, while that of Nehemiah was drawn out in Judea, after the walls of Jerusalem had been rebuilt. The lapse of so many years might well be expected to make a difference appear in the catalogue, through death or other causes; in particular, one person being, according to Jewish custom, called by different names. Thus Hariph (Ne 7:24) is the same as Jorah (Ezr 2:18), Sia (Ne 7:47) the same as Siaha (Ezr 2:44), &c. Besides other purposes to which this genealogy of the nobles, rulers, and people was subservient, one leading object contemplated by it was to ascertain with accuracy the parties to whom the duty legally belonged of ministering at the altar and conducting the various services of the temple. For guiding to exact information in this important point of enquiry, the possession of the old register of Zerubbabel was invaluable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God put into mine heart:</span> this action, though merely prudential, he doth not ascribe to himself, or his own wit, but to the gift and grace of God directing and inclining him to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people</span> not only for the particular end here mentioned, but for divers other weighty purposes and matters, of which the following chapters treat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they might be reckoned by genealogy; </span> that so it might appear to what families each person belonged, and where their ancient habitations lay, which for a great number of them were in the city, the replenishing of which was now his design. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Them which came up at the first, </span> to wit, with Zerubbabel, as it follows, <span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/7-7.htm" title="Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.

The census would show what proportion the country and town populations bore to each other, and would point out which were the places in the country districts that could best afford to lose a portion of their inhabitants. A census, therefore was resolved upon, and, according to ordinary Jewish usage (<a href="/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17-47</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5, 6</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-62</a>), it was genealogical. The tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi were numbered separately (<a href="/nehemiah/11-4.htm">Nehemiah 11:4-19</a>); and in the tribe of Judah the children of Pharez were reckoned apart from those of Zerah (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-4.htm">1 Chronicles 9:4, 6</a>). No doubt the genealogical principle was acted upon throughout, but further evidence upon the point is wanting. It would seem to have been in the course of his preparations for this census, perhaps in searching for precedents, that Nehemiah found the "register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first," which is the subject of the next section. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 7:6-73 THE REGISTER OF THOSE WHO RETURNED UNDER ZERUBBABEL, WITH THE NUMBER OF THEIR SLAVES, BEASTS, AND OBLATIONS (<a href="/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6-73</a>). It is no doubt a curious circumstance that this list should occur twice, with no important differences, in the two Books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Perhaps it was not in the original Ezra, that writer not having had the good fortune to "<span class="accented">find"</span> the document; but Nehemiah having "found" it and inserted it here, in connection with its discovery, a later arranger (Malachi?) removed it to the early part of Ezra, because it belonged to that portion of the Jewish history chronologically. The double record enables us to make out a more perfect catalogue than we could have obtained from either separately,-since there are corruptions in each which may be corrected by means of the other. See the comment which follows. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For many in Judah were sworn unto him, for he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken (to wife) the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. In this case Tobiah was connected with two Jewish families, - a statement which is made to confirm the fact that many in Judah were &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, associates of an oath, joined to him by an oath, not allies in consequence of a treaty sworn to (Bertheau). From this reason being given, we may conclude his affinity by marriage was confirmed by an oath. Shecaniah ben Arah was certainly a respectable Jew of the race of Arah, <a href="/ezra/2-5.htm">Ezra 2:5</a>. Meshullam ben Berechiah appears among those who shared in the work of building, <a href="/nehemiah/3-4.htm">Nehemiah 3:4</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/3-30.htm">Nehemiah 3:30</a>. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>, the high priest Eliashib was also related to Tobiah. From the fact that both Tobiah and his son Jehohanan have genuine Jewish names, Bertheau rightly infers that they were probably descended from Israelites of the northern kingdom of the ten tribes. With this the designation of Tobiah as "the Ammonite" may be harmonized by the supposition that his more recent or remote ancestors were naturalized Ammonites.</body></html>
