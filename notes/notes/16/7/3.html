Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot, &c.&#8212;In the East it is customary to open the gates of a city at sunrise, and to bar them at sunset&#8212;a rule which is very rarely, and not except to persons of authority, infringed upon. Nehemiah recommended that the gates of Jerusalem should not be opened so early; a precaution necessary at a time when the enemy was practising all sorts of dangerous stratagems, to ensure that the inhabitants were all astir and enjoyed the benefit of clear broad daylight for observing the suspicious movements of any enemy. The propriety of regularly barring the gates at sunset was, in this instance, accompanied with the appointment of a number of the people to act as sentinels, each mounting guard in front of his own house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Until the sun be hot, </span> i.e. till it be clear and broad day; when enemies approaching may be discovered, and the people of the city will be ready for the defence in case of an assault. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">While they stand by, </span> i.e. the watches appointed to that end, as is manifest from the following words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every one to be over against his house, </span> i.e. every one in his turn keeping watch with others in that watching-place which is next to his house. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I said unto them, let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot,....

The K’ri is supported by the LXX. and Vulg. ‘Them,’ Hanani and Hananiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">until the sun be hot</span>] Vulg. ‘Usque ad calorem solis,’ i.e. until the sun was high in the heavens; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/11-9.htm" title="And they said to the messengers that came, Thus shall you say to the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, you shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.">1 Samuel 11:9</a>, ‘By the time the sun is hot.’ The customary practice was to open the gates at sunrise. By this regulation the enemy would be effectually prevented from obtaining any advantage by an entry into the city before the inhabitants were stirring. The LXX. (<span class="greekheb">ἔως ἄμα τῷ ἡλίῳ</span>) did not understand the sentence. Rashi also explains ‘until mid-day,’ erroneously. The shutting of the gates was a sign of suspicion: cf. the opposite description of security in <a href="/isaiah/60-11.htm" title="Therefore your gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.">Isaiah 60:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">stand by</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">stand on guard.</span> The meaning apparently is that the gates were to be shut while the regular watch was still on guard. The A.V. ‘stand by’ refers to Hanani and Hananiah, as if the gates were always to be shut in the presence of the governors. But it would have been an impossibility for the two officers to have been present at the fastening of each gate. The emphasis rests on the word ‘while.’ The guard of Levites are to be at their post, while the doors were being secured.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shut … bar</span>] LXX. <span class="greekheb">κλείσθωσαν</span> … <span class="greekheb">σφηνούσθωσαν</span>, Vulg. ‘clausæ … oppilatæ.’ The versions give the general sense. The word rendered ‘shut’ occurs only here in the O.T. in the mood employed in this verse. The word rendered ‘bar’ means literally ‘to seize.’ Hence Rashi explains, ‘let them take hold of the doors in order to shut them;’ and other interpretations have been ‘take hold in order to see whether they were fastened,’ and ‘take hold of the keys.’ But the marginal rendering of the R.V. <a href="/1_kings/6-10.htm" title="And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.">1 Kings 6:10</a>, ‘he fastened the house,’ will illustrate its usage in the present verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">appoint watches</span> &c.] It does not appear whether Hanani and Hananiah are the subject or the Levite guards. The verb in the original is in the Infin. Abs. (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm" title="For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.">Nehemiah 6:9</a>) and expresses the command in general terms (LXX. <span class="greekheb">στῆσον</span>, Vulg. ‘posui’). The citizens themselves were to be organised for the defence of the place. Every man was to belong to a particular guardhouse, and take his turn in sentinel duty; and every man also was to be responsible for the protection of his own dwelling.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not the gates be opened until the sun be hot</span>. The gates of towns in the East are usually opened at sunrise; but this cannot be the intention here.
