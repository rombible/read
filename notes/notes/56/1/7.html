In the Pastoral Epistles written between A.D. 63-67 these terms are clearly applied indifferently to the same person. The title presbyter refers to the gravity and dignity of the office; the title bishop suggests rather the duties which belong to an elder of the church. On the question of bishops, and their position in the early Church, see Note on <a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1Timothy 3:1</a>, where the grounds for assuming that the episcopal order was formally introduced into church government before the end of this century, and during the lifetime of St. John, are discussed. The Christian bishop, within a quarter of a century after the death of St. Paul, assumed many of the functions and generally discharged the duties of government which were exercised by the Apostles during their lifetime. The presbyter—then writes St. Paul—seeing he is appointed an overseer or bishop (the use of the latter term bishop in the ecclesiastical sense is, however, premature), as God’s steward, as a responsible administrator of the House, that is, of the Church of the Living God, ought indeed be blameless.<p><span class= "bld">Not selfwilled.</span>—He should not be one of those self-loving men who seeks to gratify his own personal ends in the first place, and in consequence is usually regardless of others.<p><span class= "bld">Not soon angry.</span>—Not soon provoked, or not irascible. He should not be one ever ready with an angry, hasty word, remembering always his Master, “who when He was reviled, reviled not again.”<p><span class= "bld">Not given to wine.</span>—While the presbyter is not to be chosen on account of any stern austerities or rigid asceticism he may have practised, he must be known as one “temperate,” moderate, self-denying.<p><span class= "bld">No striker.</span>—Not a brawler. No man of God—above all things, no one holding office in the church—should ever, even under sore provocation, so far forget himself as to raise his hand against his fellow.<p><span class= "bld">Not given to filthy lucre.</span>—The presbyter of the House of God must be above all dreaming of mean and paltry gains. He who is to administer the alms devoted to God must surely do it with clean hands. There is, too, another and a deeper meaning in the words. The presbyter whose mind is at all devoted to the amassing of gold is too preoccupied to be able to fix his thoughts upon those high things of God committed to his charge, among which one of his most important duties is to instruct the flock.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-9 The character and qualification of pastors, here called elders and bishops, agree with what the apostle wrote to Timothy. Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel.

This shows that a bishop and an elder is the same; and the Syriac version here renders it, "an elder"; the character or qualification necessary to him is the same as before, and in like manner to be understood; unless it should more particularly refer to his faithfulness in the discharge of his office: since it follows, <p>as the steward of God; one appointed by God over his household and family, the church, to give to everyone their portion of meat in due season; one that dispenses the manifold grace, or various doctrines of the grace of God, and mysteries of Christ; and of such an one it is required, that he be faithful, both to his Lord and master, to the trust committed to him, and to the persons under his care. <p>Not selfwilled; not doing things in the worship and house of God, in the ministry of the word, and administration of ordinances, according to his own will, but according to the will of God, revealed in his word; otherwise what he does will come under the name of will worship: or obstinate, stubborn, and inflexible, conceited of his own sense and judgment, and resolute to have his own will and way in all things relating to the affairs of God's house.

Even in the 4th century Chrysostom complains that men came to the Holy Communion hustling and kicking one another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not self-willed, not soon angry</span>] ‘Self-willed,’ ‘headstrong,’ ‘unfeeling,’ occurs only here and <a href="/2_peter/2-10.htm" title="But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.">2 Peter 2:10</a> in N.T. Theophrastus (<span class="ital">Char</span>. xv.) describes the character in a way which shews the idea conveyed by the word to be worse than our English ‘self-willed’ implies. He describes it as ‘A certain roughness that shews itself in a man’s whole conversation and behaviour. Ask one of this savage temper if he has seen such a person lately, he answers you, <span class="ital">Prithee, friend, don’t be impertinent</span>. If you desire to know the price of anything he has to sell, he grows surly, and asks <span class="ital">what fault you find with it?</span> He is inexorable upon the slightest offence; do but chance to tread upon his foot, or push him with your elbow, and he’ll never forget you as long as he lives. If a friend desires to borrow some money of him he at first gives him a flat denial, but upon second thoughts brings it to him, and throwing it down in a churlish manner, <span class="ital">Well, here ’tis</span>, says he, <span class="ital">but I never expect to see it again</span>. If he stumbles against a stone in the street, he looks back and falls a cursing it.’ Burgell’s Trans. ‘Soon angry,’ ‘irascible,’ ‘choleric,’ only here in N.T., not as Theod. Mops, ‘reminiscentem iram et per longi temporis spatia tenentem,’ i.e. ‘bearing malice.’ The form of the word denotes rather ‘liable to,’ ‘with frequent fits of.’ So the word occurs in the <span class="ital">Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</span>, iii. 1, ‘Be not soon angry, for anger leadeth to murder.’ The word for ‘jesting,’ <a href="/ephesians/5-4.htm" title="Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.">Ephesians 5:4</a>, is from an adjective of similar form, ‘quick at banter.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not given to wine, no striker</span>] As in <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1 Timothy 3:3</a>, <span class="bld">not quarrelsome over wine, no striker</span>; see notes there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not given to filthy lucre</span>] As of the deacons in <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>, where see note; elsewhere in N.T. only the adverb, <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a>. Vulg. ‘non turpis lucri cupidum.’ Bp Ellicott (following Huther) refers it especially to ‘dishonesty with the alms of the Church, or any abuse of a spiritual office for purposes of gain.’ The similarly formed word ‘filthy communication,’ <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a>, is in R.V. ‘shameful speaking’; and it would be clearer to render here <span class="bld">not given to unfair gains</span>. ‘<span class="ital">Fair</span> gains’ are the parson’s right for fair pains, <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm" title="For the scripture said, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.">1 Timothy 5:18</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-6.htm" title="The farmer that labors must be first partaker of the fruits.">2 Timothy 2:6</a>. The phrase ‘filthy lucre’ has come to bear a meaning as if, according to a right and high standard, money <span class="ital">per se</span>, rents, tithes, and fees, were all ‘of the earth’ worldly, and unfit to be pressed for by any clergyman who professed to set an example.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/titus/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὡς Θεοῦ οἰκονόμον</span>, <span class="ital">as the steward of God</span>) The greater that the Master is, the greater virtues should be in His servant.

The power, therefore, of a bishop is indeed circumscribed, but he has still some authority. He is a <span class="ital">steward</span>, and the <span class="ital">steward of God;</span> but a steward has at least some authority and power, something is entrusted to his fidelity and skill; he does not merely use the power of locomotion, he is not an instrument or a machine: the steward of God is not the slave of men, not a drudge or a sutler; only let him be a true steward. This remark needs to be made in opposition to the false politicians, who desire that the ministers of Christ, and the princes, whose name they abuse, and believers and all things, should belong, not to God, not to believers, but to themselves.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ αὐθάδη</span>, <span class="ital">not harsh</span> or <span class="ital">self-willed</span>) The antithesis is in <a href="/titus/1-8.htm" title="But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;">Titus 1:8</a>, <span class="ital">a lover of hospitality;</span> for <span class="greekheb">αὐθάδης</span>, a man <span class="ital">harsh, inflexible</span>, neglects humble guests, as Nabal did, 1 Samuel 25; he cares for himself alone, and whatever is connected with himself: others also he bids to keep their own affairs and anxieties to themselves.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀργίλον</span>, <span class="ital">not soon angry</span>) The antithesis is <span class="ital">a lover of good</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ πάροινον</span>, <span class="ital">not given to wine</span>) The antithesis is <span class="ital">sober</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ πλήκτην</span>, <span class="ital">no striker</span>) The antithesis is <span class="ital">just</span>, who decides by reason and equity, not by violence.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ αἰσχροκερδῆ</span>, <span class="ital">not covetous of filthy lucre</span>) Base gain (filthy lucre) might be acquired in a matter honourable in itself, as in the work-shop, in bargains and merchandise, in the office of a bishop; <a href="/titus/1-11.htm" title="Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.">Titus 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-5.htm" title="Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself.">1 Timothy 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-12.htm" title="But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.">2 Corinthians 11:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm" title="Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)">Php 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1 Peter 5:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2 Peter 2:3</a>.
