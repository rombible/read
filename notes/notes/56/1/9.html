The elder must, St. Paul says, hold fast the faithful word or saying; or, in other words, must steadily adhere to that Christian doctrine taught by St. Paul and his brother Apostles. So St. Paul pressed on Timothy, the chief presbyter of Ephesus, “to hold the pattern of sound words which thou heardest from me” (<a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2Timothy 1:13</a>); and again, “But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them” (<a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm" title="But continue you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;">2Timothy 3:14</a>). Here “the faithful saying,” that formulary so common in the Epistles to Timothy and to Titus, and which we have generally explained as including the great Christian watchwords of the faith, echoes probably of sayings of Christ, taken up and expanded by His chosen servants, and then adopted in the various churches and woven into the tapestry of the earliest liturgies—now, possibly, after a form like the “comfortable words” of our Communion Service, now into a creed, now into a hymn, but in one shape or other thoroughly well known and loved in the different congregations—here the faithful word or saying seems to include <span class= "ital">all</span> the faithful sayings, and denotes generally the teaching of St. Paul and the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">To exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</span>—Two special purposes are specified for which the “sound doctrine” which the elder will acquire by steadfast application may be used. The first, with the sound, healthy teaching—sound, healthy, practical, compared with that sickly, morbid, and unpractical teaching of those gainsayers of whom he is going to speak—he is <span class= "ital">to exhort</span> the adversaries; secondly, with the same true words he is <span class= "ital">to confute</span> their arguments. Chrysostom well remarks “that he who knows not how to contend with adversaries, and is not able to demolish their arguments, is far from the teacher’s chair.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-9 The character and qualification of pastors, here called elders and bishops, agree with what the apostle wrote to Timothy. Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel.

The doctrine of the Gospel, so called because it is true, and to be believed; it is the word of truth, and truth itself, and contains nothing but truth; and because it never deceived any, that gave credit to its doctrines, and its promises; and because it is pure, unmixed, and unadulterated, and is the sincere milk of the word; and because in it is a glorious display of the faithfulness of God to his perfections, to his holiness and justice, to his law, and to his covenant, word, and oath; and of the faithfulness of Christ, to him that appointed him and to his covenant engagements, and which has appeared in the discharge of his various offices: and this is not only to be held forth by the elder, but to be held fast, and tenaciously abode by; in opposition to all wavering about it, departure from it, dropping or concealing any part of it, and pusillanimity concerning it; whatever temptations there may be to the contrary, through popular applause on the one hand, and reproaches and persecutions on the other; and though there may be many that may endeavour to wring it out of his hands; see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13</a>, <p>as he hath been taught; or "according to doctrine": that is, according to the doctrine of the Scriptures, Christ, and his apostles; according to the doctrine that lies in the Scriptures that was delivered by Christ, and preached by his apostles; whatever is according to that should be held fast: <p>or which is for doctrine, which tends to teach, instruct, and edify the minds of men, that ought to be constantly abode by: or as the elder himself has been taught, not by men, in a theoretical way, as logic, rhetoric, and other arts and sciences are taught; for such who are only taught the faithful word in this way, are not likely to hold it fast, in a time of temptation; but as he has been taught it experimentally by the Spirit of God; and such an one, who has not only the knowledge of it in his head, but the experience of it in his heart, will hold it, and hold it fast against all opposition: <p>that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers; sound doctrine is the faithful word, the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, which being retained, qualify an elder to discharge the following branches of his office; to "exhort" the members of churches to their duty, according to their age, sex, state, and condition, as in chapter 2 to which the doctrines of grace influence and engage; or to comfort them, as the word also signifies, and the Alexandrian copy reads, "to comfort them in all tribulation"; and this is one considerable part of the elder's work, to comfort souls under affliction, whether of body or mind; and sound doctrines, or the doctrines of the Gospel, are wonderfully suited to such a purpose: and the other part of his work is, "to convince gainsayers"; such who resist the truth, oppose themselves to it, cavil at it, and object against it; these are to be refitted, and convinced by the Scriptures, and arguments taken from them, as the Jews were by Apollos, <a href="/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a> and nothing is so powerful to do it as sound doctrine, and holding fast the faithful word. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/titus/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, <span class="cverse3">{9}</span> that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</span><p>(8) The third admonition: the pastor must hold fast that doctrine which the apostles delivered, and pertains to salvation, leaving behind all curious and vain matters.<p>(9) The fourth admonition: to apply the knowledge of true doctrine to use, which consists in two things, that is, in governing those who show themselves able to learn, and confuting the obstinate.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/titus/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/titus/1-9.htm" title="Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.">Titus 1:9</a>. To these requisites, somewhat general in nature, Paul adds another with special bearing on the official duties of a bishop: <span class="greekheb">ἀντεχόμενον τοῦ κατὰ τὴν διδαχὴν πιστοῦ λόγου</span>] The exposition given by most of the compound idea <span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span> … <span class="greekheb">λόγου</span> is inaccurate and confused. Heydenreich divides the expression into two parts: (1) <span class="greekheb">ὁ πιστὸς λόγος</span>, “the true doctrine of the gospel;” and (2) <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος κατὰ τὴν διδαχήν</span>, “the doctrine in which the bishop is instructed,” and gives the following translation: “holding firmly, as instructed, by the word which is certain (to reliable doctrine).” But manifestly this translation arbitrarily inverts the meaning. The words <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν διδαχήν</span> are not dependent on <span class="greekheb">πιστοῦ</span>, but on <span class="greekheb">λόγου</span>, defined by <span class="greekheb">πιστοῦ</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πιστοῦ λόγ</span>. is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πιστοῦ λόγου</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κατὰ τὴν διδαχήν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ πιστὸς λόγος</span> does not occur elsewhere in our epistles, but there is no doubt that Paul means thereby the pure, wholesome word (<span class="greekheb">λόγοι ὑγιαίνοντες</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm" title="If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;">1 Timothy 6:3</a>; <span class="greekheb">οἱ λόγοι τῆς πίστεως</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.">1 Timothy 4:6</a>) of the gospel, in contrast to the false doctrine of the heretics. He uses the epithet <span class="greekheb">πιστός</span> because it is not treacherous, it can be relied on: “<span class="ital">the sure, reliable word</span>.” This sure word is defined more precisely by <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν διδαχήν</span>] <span class="greekheb">διδαχή</span> is not active (Luther: “that which can teach”), but means, as it often does in the N. T., “<span class="ital">doctrine</span>.” Here it denotes “the Christian doctrine,” which is none other than that preached by Christ Himself and by His apostles; so Matthies, Wiesinger, Plitt, Hofmann. It is less appropriate to explain <span class="greekheb">διδαχή</span> to be “the instruction imparted” (so van Oosterzee, and formerly in this commentary); comp. <a href="/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.">1 Timothy 4:6</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀντέχεσθαι</span> (in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.
