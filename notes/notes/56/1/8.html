but the direction of St. Paul has that broader signification, so beautifully worded in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where we are told not to be forgetful to entertain <span class= "ital">strangers, </span>for thereby some have entertained angels unawares (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm" title="Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A lover of good men.</span>—Although this rendering is possible, still it is better to understand the Greek word here as alluding to a virtue differing from the “hospitality” just mentioned. “A lover of good” or benevolence generally; the appellation points here to that large heart which finds room for sympathy with all that is good and noble and generous.<p><span class= "bld">Sober.</span>—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">self-restrained.</span> In this expressive word (<span class= "ital">sophrona</span>)<span class= "ital"> mastery of self</span> is especially implied—that self-command which wisely regulates pleasures and passions.<p><span class= "bld">Just.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">righteous.</span> The man who is just (<span class= "ital">dikaios</span>) is one who tries strictly to perform his duties <span class= "ital">towards men</span>—the duties which integrity and justice seem imperatively to ask from him in his relations with his neighbour.<p><span class= "bld">Holy.</span>—The man who is <span class= "ital">holy</span> studies to be true and faithful <span class= "ital">in his relations to God, </span>which duties with us largely consist in keeping pure our bodies, the temple of the Holy Spirit.

The model presbyter, the ruler of a congregation of Christians, not only must be able to control his tongue, his eyes, his hands, but must show a just and wise moderation even in pressing things which of themselves are excellent. To do his Master’s work efficiently, he must be able at all times to command himself—to perform that most difficult of all tasks, the tempering zeal with discretion.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/titus/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-9 The character and qualification of pastors, here called elders and bishops, agree with what the apostle wrote to Timothy. Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel.
