Blameless must be his life, spotless his name. As it has been well said, “the office of presbyter must never be allowed to cover or condone damaged reputations.”<p><span class= "bld">The husband of one wife.</span>—See Notes on <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Having faithful children.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">believing children.</span> In searching out these presbyters, whose charge would involve so many and such responsible duties, Titus must look for men of ripe age. There were even grave objections to the appointment of the comparatively young to this office. We have seen how anxious St. Paul was for Timothy, his well-known and trusted friend, on account of his want of years. Timothy must have been at least approaching forty years of age when St. Paul warned him so earnestly of his behaviour and his life, “Let no man despise thy youth.” These presiding Cretan elders should be married men, with children already, so to speak, grown up.<p>These requirements evidently show that Christianity had been established in Crete for a very considerable period. We must remember some thirty-three years had passed since that memorable Pentecost feast of Jerusalem, when “Cretes” were among the hearers of those marvellous utterances of the Spirit. Besides the children of the candidates for the presbyter’s office being professing Christians, they must also be free from all suspicion of profligacy.<p><span class= "bld">Not accused of riot.</span>—More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">dissoluteness.</span> The Greek word here rendered “riot” implies a self-indulgent or even a reckless expenditure. Such careless selfishness well-nigh always ends in profligacy. In the case of men whose duties included the superintendence of the Church’s funds, it was imperatively necessary that their homes and families should be free from all suspicion of anything like that reckless waste or extravagance which in so many cases imperceptibly passes into dissoluteness and profligacy.<p><span class= "bld">Or unruly.</span>—That is, disobedient to their parents. If the presbyter was incapable of teaching his own children obedience and order, what hope was there that his influence would be of any value with his flock? All these early instructions to the master-builders whose task it was to lay the early storeys of the Christian Temple are very decisive as to the state of St. Paul’s mind; and we must not forget <span class= "ital">whence</span> St. Paul directly drew his wisdom. The Apostles of the Lord never seem to have thought of the Christian priesthood of the future <span class= "ital">developing into a caste or</span> <span class= "ital">order.</span> Anything more diametrically opposed to the mediæval notion of church government than the Pastoral Epistles can hardly be imagined. The writer of the Epistles to Timothy and to Titus never dreamed of building up a priestly order with views, thoughts, hopes, and joys differing from those of the ordinary worker of the world. St. Paul’s presbyters were to be chosen, among other qualities, for the white and blameless lives of their families. The presbyter’s home in Crete and Ephesus must supply a fair pattern for the many other Christian homes in that luxurious, dissolute age in which Titus lived.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/titus/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/titus/1-6.htm" title="If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly....">Titus 1:6-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">If any be blameless </span>— As to his conduct, shunning the appearance of evil, and walking in all the ordinances and commandments of God; <span class="ital">the husband of one wife </span>— See on <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <span class="ital">having faithful, </span>or believing <span class="ital">children </span>— As <span class="greekheb">τεκνα πιστα </span>may be properly rendered; that is, not infidels, but such as embrace the Christian faith; <span class="ital">not accused of riot </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ασωτιαστυ </span><span class="ital">of luxury, </span>or <span class="ital">intemperance; or unruly </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ανυποτακτα</span>, <span class="ital">refractory </span>or <span class="ital">disobedient. </span>The apostle required that the children of the person who was to be ordained an elder should be believers in Christ, and of a sober, exemplary behaviour, because the infidelity and vices of children never fail to reflect some blame on their parents.

Being such bishops and overseers of the flock, to be examples to them, and God's stewards to take care of the affairs of his household, there is great reason that they should be blameless. What they are not to be, is plainly shown, as well as what they are to be, as servants of Christ, and able ministers of the letter and practice of the gospel. And here are described the spirit and practice becoming such as should be examples of good works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/titus/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife - See the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>.<p>Having faithful children - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>. That is, having a family well-governed, and well-trained in religion. The word here - &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;  pista - applied to the children, and rendered faithful, does not necessarily mean that they should be truly pious, but it is descriptive of those who had been well-trained, and were in due subordination. If a man's family were not of his character - if his children were insubordinate, and opposed to religion - if they were decided infidels or scoffers, it would show that there was such a deficiency in the head of the family that he could not be safely entrusted with the government of the church; compare the notes at <a href="/1_timothy/3-5.htm">1 Timothy 3:5</a>. It is probably true, also, that the preachers at that time would be selected, as far as practicable, from those whose families were all Christians. There might be great impropriety in placing a man over a church, a part of whose family were Jews or heathens.<p>Not accused of riot - That is, whose children were not accused of riot. This explains what is meant by faithful. The word rendered "riot" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  aso&#772;tia - is translated excess in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, and riot in <a href="/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4</a>.

The meaning here is, that they should not be justly accused of this; this should not be their character. It would, doubtless, be a good reason now why a man should not be ordained to the ministry that he had a dissipated and disorderly family.<p>Or unruly - Insubordinate; ungoverned; see the notes, <a href="/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/titus/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. (Compare Notes, see on [2517]1Ti 3:2-4.) The thing dwelt on here as the requisite in a bishop, is a good reputation among those over whom he is to be set. The immorality of the Cretan professors rendered this a necessary requisite in one who was to be a reprover: and their unsoundness in doctrine also made needful great steadfastness in the faith (Tit 1:9, 13).<p>having faithful children&#8212;that is, believing children.

Technically, ‘not a bigamist.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having faithful children</span>] ‘Faithful’ is ambiguous, implying either ‘trustworthy’ or ‘believing’; no doubt the latter is intended; the presbyter’s household must not be one where the influence and teaching have been such that the children have still remained heathen; nor yet one where ‘faith’ and ‘duty’ have been severed; for they must also be neither <span class="bld">chargeable with riotous living nor unruly</span>, but living ‘in temperance, soberness and chastity,’ and submitting themselves ‘to all that are put in authority.’ ‘Riotous living’ is perhaps better than R.V. ‘riot’ (which is also substituted for the A.V. rendering of the same word ‘excess’ in <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18</a>), as recalling the typical instance of the character in the ‘<span class="ital">Prodigal</span> Son,’ <a href="/luke/15-13.htm" title="And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.">Luke 15:13</a>. ‘The <span class="ital">prodigal</span> is one who cannot save or spare, to use Spenser’s word, ‘scatterling.’ The word forms part of Aristotle’s ethical terminology, the truly liberal man being one who keeps the golden mean between the two extremes, <span class="ital">prodigality</span> on one side and <span class="ital">stinginess</span> on the other.’ Trench, <span class="ital">N.T.
