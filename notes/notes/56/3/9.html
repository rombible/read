The Apostle characterises them as “foolish,” because they were of an utterly unpractical nature, and consumed time and powers which were needed for other and better things. The “contentions” were disputes and wranglings which arose out of arguments advanced by different teachers upon the “questions” and “genealogies.” The “strivings about the law” were, most probably, arguments suggested by disputed and intricate points connected with the law of Moses. In the Talmud we possess unnumbered instances of all these strange and curious inquiries about which men then gravely disputed and wrangled, but none of which could in any way teach men how to make life more beautiful and loving, more like that fair pattern which St. Paul’s Master loved. St. Paul, well versed—thanks to his early and elaborate training—in all this useless, curious lore, once and for all would expel from orthodox Christian teaching everything which seemed to bear upon this favourite Jewish theology—so called. It had, cancer-like, eaten the life out of Judaism; it should not, if he could prevent it, poison in like manner the young life of Christianity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/titus/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/titus/3-9.htm" title="But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.">Titus 3:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">But avoid foolish questions </span>— Questions of no consequence; <span class="ital">and genealogies </span>— See on <a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-23.htm" title="But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do engender strifes.">2 Timothy 2:23</a>; <span class="ital">and contentions, &c., about the law </span>— About the observance of the ceremonial law, or some little things contained therein; <span class="ital">for they are unprofitable, </span>&c. — Not only consuming to no purpose that time which is capable of being much better improved, but also tending to discompose men’s minds, to alienate the affections of Christians from each other, and to render them indifferent to the proper duties of life.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/titus/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-11 When the grace of God towards mankind has been declared, the necessity of good works is pressed.
