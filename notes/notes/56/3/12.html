Not improbably one of these two was intended to supply the place of Titus when this favourite and trusted assistant of St. Paul was recalled to his master’s side. Of Artemas nothing certainly is known. Tradition, however, makes him subsequently Bishop of Lystra. Tychicus is mentioned in five of the New Testament writings—in <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-12.htm" title="And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.">2Timothy 4:12</a>; and here. He seems to have been one of the most esteemed of St. Paul’s friends.

On the whole, the Nicopolis in Epirus seems the most likely spot for the Apostle to have fixed on. This city was built by Augustus after the battle of Actium, whence it derived its name, “the City of Victory.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/titus/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/titus/3-12.htm" title="When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.">Titus 3:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus </span>— To succeed thee in thy office; <span class="ital">be diligent to come unto me </span>— Tychicus is often mentioned in St. Paul’s epistles, but of Artemas we know nothing: only from this passage it appears that he was a faithful and able teacher, and fit to supply Titus’s place in Crete. <span class="ital">At Nicopolis </span>— There was a city of this name in Macedonia, on the confines of Thrace; also one in Epirus, and another in Pontus.

They must be doing good, as well as keeping away from evil. Let ours follow some honest labour and employment, to provide for themselves and their families. Christianity obliges all to seek some honest work and calling, and therein to abide with God. The apostle concludes with expressions of kind regard and fervent prayer. Grace be with you all; the love and favour of God, with the fruits and effects thereof, according to need; and the increase and feeling of them more and more in your souls. This is the apostle's wish and prayer, showing his affection to them, and desire for their good, and would be a means of obtaining for them, and bringing down on them, the thing requested. Grace is the chief thing to be wished and prayed for, with respect to ourselves or others; it is all good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/titus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I shall send Artemas unto thee - This person is not elsewhere mentioned in the New Testament, and nothing more is known of him.<p>Or Tychicus - Notes, <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>.<p>Be diligent - Notes, <a href="/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9</a>.

There is no evidence that he organized a church there, though it may be presumed that he preached the gospel, and that he did not do it without success. His requesting Titus to leave his important post and to come to him, looks as if his aid were needed in the work of the ministry there, and as if Paul supposed there was a promising field of labor there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/titus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Had the apostle’s purpose been that Artemas or Tychicus should continue the work begun by Titus, he would surely have given some hint of it, and not contented himself with the simple <span class="greekheb">πρὸς σέ</span>. It is more probable that the apostle wished to have Titus brought by one of them, as he could not yet determine the exact time when he was to come (Hofmann). Nicopolis is a name borne by several cities, one in Epirus, built by Augustus as a memorial of his victory at Actium; another built by Trajan in Thrace; and another in Cilicia. In the subscription of the epistle there stands: <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Νικοπόλεως τῆς Μακεδονίας</span>, which may mean either the city in Thrace or that in Epirus. It does not appear from his words that Paul wrote the epistle there; on the contrary, the <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖ</span> rather shows that Paul himself was not there when he wrote the epistle.

As to the conjectural chapter of biography of which we have traces here, see introduction, pp. 40–44. We may suppose that the object of the sending Tychicus or Artemas was to take the place of Titus during his stay with St Paul. From <a href="/2_timothy/4-12.htm" title="And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.">2 Timothy 4:12</a>, Tychicus would seem to have been sent to Ephesus, so that Artemas may have been finally chosen for Crete. Of him nothing is known. Tychicus is one of the most valued of the ‘fellow helpers,’ ‘the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord,’ entrusted with the Ephesian and Colossian letters, and the ‘comfortable words,’ five years before, in the enforced absence of the first imprisonment at Rome, <a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/titus/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/titus/3-12.htm" title="When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.">Titus 3:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀρτεμᾶν ἢ Τυχιχὸν</span>, <span class="ital">Artemas or Tychicus</span>) into whose hands Titus might deliver the lamp of the Gospel.—<span class="greekheb">ἐλθεῖν πρός με</span>, <span class="ital">to come to me</span>) when affairs in Crete shall have been more fully set in order.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">there</span>) He does not say <span class="ital">here</span>.

He would not leave the presbyters in either place without the direction and superintendence of one having his delegated apostolic authority. This led to the final placing of a resident bishop in the Churches, such as we find in the second century. We may conclude that Artemas (otherwise unknown) was the person eventually sent to Crete, as <span class="cmt_word">Tychicus</span> (<a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>) we know went to Ephesus (<a href="/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>). We have also an important note of time in this expression, showing clearly that this Epistle was written before the Second Epistle to Timothy (as it probably also was before 1 Timothy) - an inference abundantly corroborated by <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>, by which it appears that Titus had then actually joined St. Paul, either at Nicopolis or elsewhere, and had started off again to Dalmatia. <span class="cmt_word">Give diligence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>, note; 2 Timothy 4:9, 21. <span class="cmt_word">Nicopolis</span>, in Epirus. The most obvious reason for St. Paul's wintering at Nicopolis is that it was near Apollonia, the harbor opposite Brindisium, which would be his way to Rome, and also well situated for the missionary work in Dalmatia, which we learn from <a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a> was in hand. Nicopolis (the city of victory) was built by Augustus Caesar to commemorate the great naval victory at Actium over Antony.
