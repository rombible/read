They must be doing good, as well as keeping away from evil. Let ours follow some honest labour and employment, to provide for themselves and their families. Christianity obliges all to seek some honest work and calling, and therein to abide with God. The apostle concludes with expressions of kind regard and fervent prayer. Grace be with you all; the love and favour of God, with the fruits and effects thereof, according to need; and the increase and feeling of them more and more in your souls. This is the apostle's wish and prayer, showing his affection to them, and desire for their good, and would be a means of obtaining for them, and bringing down on them, the thing requested. Grace is the chief thing to be wished and prayed for, with respect to ourselves or others; it is all good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/titus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All that are with me salute thee - Notes, <a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>. Paul, at the close of his epistles, usually mentions the names of those who sent affectionate salutations. Here it would seem to be implied that Titus knew who were with Paul, and also that he himself had been traveling with him. He evidently refers not to those who were residing in the place where he was, but to those who had gone with him from Crete as his companions.<p>Greet them that love us in the faith - In the faith of the gospel, or as Christians. No names are here mentioned; compare <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-15.htm">Colossians 4:15</a>.<p>Grace be with you all - Notes, <a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>.<p>The subscription, "It was written to Titus," etc., is, like the other subscriptions at the close of the epistles, of no authority whatever; see the close of the notes at 1 Cor.  this subscription there are probably two errors:<p>(1) In the statement that Titus was "ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians;" because:<p>(a) there is no evidence that there was a church there called "the church of the Cretians," as there were doubtless many churches on the island;<p>(b) there is no evidence that Titus was the first Bishop of the church there, or that he was the first one there to whom might be properly applied the term "bishop" in the Scriptural sense. Indeed, there is positive evidence that he was not the first, for Paul was there with him, and Titus was "left" there to complete what he had begun.<p>(c) There is no evidence that Titus was "bishop" there at all in the prelatical sense of the term, or even that he was a settled pastor; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>, <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>.<p>(2) that the epistle was written "from Nicopolis of Macedonia;" for<p>(a) there is no certain evidence that it was written at Nicopolis at all, though this is probable;<p>(b) there is no reason to believe that the Nicopolis referred to was in Macedonia; see Introduction 4.<p>These subscriptions are so utterly destitute of authority, and are so full of mistakes, that it is high time they were omitted in the editions of the Bible. They are no part of the inspired writings, but are of the nature of "notes and comments," and are constantly doing something, perhaps much, to perpetuate-error. "The opinion that Timothy and Titus were prelatical bishops, the one of Ephesus and the other of Crete, depends far more on these worthless subscriptions than on anything in the epistles themselves." Indeed, there is no evidence of it in the epistles; and, if these subscriptions were removed, no man from the New Testament would ever suppose that they sustained this office at all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/titus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

All the apostles, fellow labourers, and the ministers of the Gospel that were with him; and all the members of the church where he was, sent their Christian salutation to Titus; he being a person greatly esteemed, and whose praise was in all the churches: <p>greet them that love us in the faith; not merely as men, as their countrymen, as related to them in the flesh; or on account of any external things, but as believers; because of the doctrine of faith, professed and preached; and because of the grace of faith obtained and possessed; or who love us faithfully, sincerely, and uprightly, from their hearts, and not in word and tongue only: <p>grace be with you all, Amen; which is the common concluding salutation in all Paul's epistles. This shows that this epistle was not designed for Titus only, but for the saints at Crete. <p>It was written to Titus the first bishop of the church of the Cretians. But this subscription, as many others, is not to be depended upon; it is not very likely that Titus was bishop of this church at all; since his stay there was but short, nor indeed elsewhere, seeing he was an evangelist; though this is asserted both by Eusebius (d), and Sophronius (e), who adds, that he died and was buried here: and what follows, that it was written <p>from Nicopolis of Macedonia, does not seem to be just, as may be concluded from <a href="/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>. Many learned men think it was written from Colosse, or some neighbouring place; though when he wrote his epistle to the Colossians it looks as if he had never been there before: the Syriac version adds, "sent by the hands of Zenas and Apollos"; which is not unlikely, since he desires they might be accommodated by Titus with what was necessary for the remaining part of their journey, <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>. <p>(d) Eccl.
