for remember, writes St. Paul, <span class= "ital">we</span> were once (not so long ago) ourselves in their condition. <span class= "ital">We</span> once needed mercy our selves. This strong appeal to Christians, by the memory of their past, by the memory of what <span class= "ital">they</span> once were, must have gone home to one like Titus, himself of a Gentile family, and most probably nurtured in idolatry. It would, no doubt, be repeated with strange, touching earnestness, would this argument of St. Paul by Titus when he spoke to the assembly of the Cretan Christians. <span class= "ital">We</span> were once ourselves “foolish,” that is, without understanding what was true; and “disobedient,” that is, unwilling, indisposed, to do what was right; “deceived,” or rather going astray (<span class= "ital">errantes</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>wandering away from the narrow road which leads to life.<p><span class= "bld">Serving divers lusts and pleasures.</span>—This is the service we served in the old past days of our sin and shame, while we were “disobedient” to what was right and pure.

Mere good words and good meanings are not enough without good works. They were not to be quarrelsome, but to show meekness on all occasions, not toward friends only, but to all men, though with wisdom, Jas 3:13. And let this text teach us how wrong it is for a Christian to be churlish to the worst, weakest, and most abject. The servants of sin have many masters, their lusts hurry them different ways; pride commands one thing, covetousness another. Thus they are hateful, deserving to be hated. It is the misery of sinners, that they hate one another; and it is the duty and happiness of saints to love one another. And we are delivered out of our miserable condition, only by the mercy and free grace of God, the merit and sufferings of Christ, and the working of his Spirit. God the Father is God our Saviour. He is the fountain from which the Holy Spirit flows, to teach, regenerate, and save his fallen creatures; and this blessing comes to mankind through Christ. The spring and rise of it, is the kindness and love of God to man. Love and grace have, through the Spirit, great power to change and turn the heart to God. Works must be in the saved, but are not among the causes of their salvation. A new principle of grace and holiness is wrought, which sways, and governs, and makes the man a new creature. Most pretend they would have heaven at last, yet they care not for holiness now; they would have the end without the beginning. Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called therefore the washing of regeneration. The work is inward and spiritual; this is outwardly signified and sealed in this ordinance. Slight not this outward sign and seal; yet rest not in the outward washing, but look to the answer of a good conscience, without which the outward washing will avail nothing. The worker therein is the Spirit of God; it is the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Through him we mortify sin, perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the working of the Divine life in us, and the fruits of righteousness without, are through this blessed and holy Spirit. The Spirit and his saving gifts and graces, come through Christ, as a Saviour, whose undertaking and work are to bring to grace and glory. Justification, in the gospel sense, is the free forgiveness of a sinner; accepting him as righteous through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. God, in justifying a sinner in the way of the gospel, is gracious to him, yet just to himself and his law. As forgiveness is through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction is made to justice by Christ, it cannot be merited by the sinner himself. Eternal life is set before us in the promise; the Spirit works faith in us, and hope of that life; faith and hope bring it near, and fill with joy in expectation of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/titus/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we ourselves - We who are Christians. There is no reason for supposing, as Benson does, that this is to be understood as confined to Paul himself. There are some things mentioned here which were not probably true of him before his conversion, and the connection does not require us to suppose that he referred particularly to himself. He is stating a reason why those to whom Titus was appointed to preach should be urged to lead holy lives, and especially to manifest a spirit of order, peace, kindness, and due subordination to law. In enforcing this, he says, that those who were now Christians had formerly been wicked, disorderly, and sensual, but that under the influence of the gospel, they had been induced to lead better lives. The same gospel which had been effectual in their case, might, be in others. To others it would be an encouragement to show that there were cases in which the gospel had been thus efficacious, and they who were appointed to preach it might refer to their own example as a reason why others should be persuaded to lead holy lives. In preaching to others, also, they were not to be proud or arrogant. They were to remember that they were formerly in the same condition with those whom they addressed, and whom they exhorted to reformation. They were not to forget that what they had that was superior to others they owed to the grace of God, and not to any native goodness. He will exhort the wicked to repentance most effectually who remembers that his own former life was wicked; he will evince most of the proper spirit in doing it who has the deepest sense of the errors and folly of his own past ways.<p>Foolish - See this word explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25</a>, where it is rendered "fools;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>, where it is rendered "unwise," and <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-3.htm">Galatians 3:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>, where it is rendered "foolish."<p>Disobedient - To law, to parents, to civil authority, to God. This is the natural character of the human heart; see <a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="/romans/1-30.htm">Romans 1:30</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>, where the same word occurs.<p>Deceived - By the great enemy, by false teachers, by our own hearts, and by the flattery of others. It is a characteristic of man by nature that he sees nothing in its true light, but walks along amidst constant, though changing and very beautiful illusions; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4-5</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-13.htm">2 Timothy 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>, where the same word occurs; see also <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where the same word is applied to that great deceiver who has led the world astray. Every one who is converted feels, and is ready to confess, that before conversion he was deceived as to the comparative value of things, as to the enjoyment which he expected to find in scenes of pleasure and riot, and often in what seemed to him well-formed plans.<p>Serving divers lusts and pleasures - Indulging in the various corrupt passions and propensities of the soul. We were so under their influence that it might be said we were their servants, or were slaves to them (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  douleuontes); that is, we implicitly obeyed them; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-17</a>.<p>Living in malice - Greek, "in evil" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;  en kakia; that is, in all kinds of evil; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>, where the word is rendered maliciousness.<p>And envy - Displeasure at the happiness and prosperity of others; Notes, <a href="/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>.<p>Hateful - &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;  stuge&#772;toi. This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means that our conduct was such as to be worthy of the hatred of others. Of whom, before his conversion, is not this true?<p>And hating one another - There was no brotherly love; no true affection for others. There was ill-will felt in the heart, and it was evinced in the life. This is an apt description of the state of the heathen world before the gospel shines on it, and it may be regarded as the characteristic of all men before conversion. They have no true love for one another, such as they ought to cherish, and they are liable constantly to give indulgence to feelings which evince hatred. In contentions, and strifes, and litigations, and wars, this feeling is constantly breaking out. All this is suggested here as a reason why Christians should now be gentle and mild toward those who are evil. Let us remember what we were, and we shall not be disposed to treat others harshly. When a Christian is tempted to unkind thoughts or words towards others, nothing is more appropriate for him than to reflect on his own past life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/titus/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Nothing has a greater tendency to promote humility, and check pride in the saints, than to reflect upon their past state and condition, what they themselves once were; and this is a reason why magistrates, though evil men, should be obeyed in things good and lawful, and why no man should be spoken evil of, and why every man should be treated in a gentle manner, and used with mildness and meekness; since the apostle himself, and Titus, and other saints, whom he designed this as an instruction for, were formerly, in their unregenerate state, just such persons themselves; and therefore should not glory over them, and treat them in a contemptuous manner: and besides, the same grace that had made a difference in them, could make one in these also, and which might be made in God's own time: and particularly, whereas they observed great ignorance in these men, they should consider that they also had been "foolish", and without understanding of things, divine and spiritual, and neither knew their own state and condition, nor the way of salvation by Christ; yea, the apostle himself, though he had a zeal for God, yet not according to knowledge; he did not know lust, nor the exceeding sinfulness of sin, until he was enlightened by the Spirit of God; he was ignorant of the righteousness of God, and went about to establish his own, which he imagined to be blameless; and thought he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus: <p>disobedient; both to the law of God, and Gospel of Christ; disbelieving the truths of the Gospel, and not subjected to the ordinances of it, notwithstanding the evidence with which they came, and the miracles by which they were confirmed. <p>Deceived; by the old serpent Satan, who deceives the whole world; and by an evil heart of unbelief, as well as by false teachers and leaders; and so, as the word signifies, were wandering about in darkness and ignorance, and were as sheep going astray, until they were returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of souls. <p>Serving divers lusts and pleasures; the lusts of the flesh are many and various, which promise pleasure to them that obey them, though that is but imaginary, and very short lived, and which subjects persons to bondage and slavery; for such who indulge to these things, are overcome by them, led captive, and brought into bondage, and are the servants of sin, vassals and slaves to their own corruptions; and such these saints had been, here spoken of: <p>living in malice and envy; they had not only malice and envy in their hearts against their fellow creatures, but practised it in their lives; yea, their lives were a continued series of malice and envy; particularly this was true of the apostle, who haled men and women out of their houses, and committed them to prison; breathed out slaughter and threatenings against the saints; was exceedingly mad against them, persecuted them to strange cities, and compelled them to blaspheme, and gave his vote for punishing them with death. <p>Hateful, and hating one another; abominable in the sight of God, as considered in themselves, and on account of their nature and practices; and to be abhorred by all good men; and who, by their continual feuds, quarrels, and animosities among themselves, showed an hatred, an abhorrence of one another. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/titus/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and</i> hating one another.</span><p>(2) He confirms again the former exhortation by propounding the free benefit of our regeneration, the symbol of which is our baptism.
