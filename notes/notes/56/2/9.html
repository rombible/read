These directions were arranged with respect to “age” and “sex.” He now turns to the question of the instruction of another large class, among whom were to be found many Christians—“the slaves.” These he masses together under one head. Not improbably these “words” to be addressed particularly to slaves were called out by some particular instances of insubordination and of impatience under their unhappy condition among the Cretan slaves. Indeed, the repeated warnings to this unfortunate and oppressed class (see <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.">1Timothy 6:1</a>) tell us that among the difficulties which Christianity had to surmount in its early years was the hard task of persuading “the slave” that the divine Master who promised him a home, if he were faithful and true, among the many mansions of His Father, meant not that the existing relations of society should be then changed, or its complex framework disturbed. St. Paul knew it was a hard matter to persuade the bondman, fellow-heir of heaven with the freeman, to acquiesce patiently in his present condition of misery and servitude. Hence these repeated charges to this class. These poor sufferers were to obey cheerfully, readily, as the next clause told them.<p><span class= "bld">And to please them well in all things; not answering again.</span>—The last words are better translated <span class= "ital">not gainsaying; </span>the Vulgate has <span class= "ital">contradicentes.</span> It signifies that they should obey cheerfully, willingly, without sullenness; not thwarting or setting themselves against their masters’ plans or desires or orders; and the Apostle, in <a href="/titus/2-10.htm" title="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a>, gives them a noble inducement for this brave, sweet patience he would have so earnestly pressed upon them. Such conduct on their part, he tells them, would serve greatly to help the Master’s cause; it would prepossess many hostile minds in favour of a religion which could so powerfully influence even the slave. Chrysostom comments thus: “Greeks form their estimate of doctrines not from the doctrine itself, but from the actions and the life” (of those who profess the doctrine).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/titus/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/titus/2-9.htm" title="Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;...">Titus 2:9-10</a>. </span><span class="ital">Exhort servants </span>— See the notes on the passages referred to in the margin. <span class="ital">To please them </span>— Their masters; <span class="ital">well in all things </span>— Lawful, or wherein it can be done without sin; <span class="ital">not answering again </span>— Though blamed unjustly.

In serving an earthly master according to Christ's will, He is served; such shall be rewarded by him. Not giving disrespectful or provoking language; but to take a check or reproof with silence, not making confident or bold replies. When conscious of a fault, to excuse or justify it, doubles it. Never putting to their own use that which is their master's, nor wasting the goods they are trusted with. Showing all good fidelity to improve a master's goods, and promote his thriving. If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? Lu 16:12.

It should be an object with one who is a servant, to meet the approbation of his master, as long as this relation continues. This rule would not, however, go to the extent to require him to please his master in doing anything that is contrary to the law of God, or that is morally wrong.<p>Not answering again - Margin, "gainsaying." Not contradicting, or not disobeying. They were to do what the master required, if it did not interfere with the rights of conscience, without attempting to argue the matter - without disputing with the master - and without advancing their own opinions. Where this relation exists, no one can doubt that this is a proper frame of mind for a servant. It may be observed, however, that all that is here said would be equally appropriate, whether the servitude was voluntary or involuntary. A man who becomes voluntarily a servant, binds himself to obey his master cheerfully and quietly, without gainsaying, and without attempting to reason the matter with him, or propounding his own opinions, even though they may be much wiser than those of his employer. He makes a contract to obey his master, not to reason with him, or to instruct him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/titus/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. servants&#8212;"slaves."<p>to please them well&#8212;"to give satisfaction" [Alford]. To be complaisant in everything; to have that zealous desire to gain the master's goodwill which will anticipate the master's wish and do even more than is required. The reason for the frequent recurrence of injunctions to slaves to subjection (Eph 6:5, &c.; Col 3:22; 1Ti 6:1, &c.; 1Pe 2:18) was, that in no rank was there more danger of the doctrine of the spiritual equality and freedom of Christians being misunderstood than in that of slaves. It was natural for the slave who had become a Christian, to forget his place and put himself on a social level with his master. Hence the charge for each to abide in the sphere in which he was when converted (1Co 7:20-24).<p>not answering again&#8212;in contradiction to the master: so the Greek, "not contradicting" [Wahl].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/titus/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters; </span> the apostle directeth as to servants of all sorts, whether bond or free, otherwise than that by covenant they have obliged themselves to men, he willeth they should be obedient to the commands of those who were their legal masters, neither thinking themselves free from them by their Christianity, if their masters were pagans, nor that they had a greater liberty to be saucy with them, or less obedient to them, because they were Christians, and upon that account brethren, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/6-2.htm" title="And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.

Heydenreich and Matthies wrongly make this verse dependent on <a href="/titus/2-1.htm" title="But speak you the things which become sound doctrine:">Titus 2:1</a>. The harder the lot of the slaves, and the more unendurable this might appear to the Christian slave conscious of his Christian dignity, the more necessary was it to impress upon him the <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάσσεσθαι</span>. Even this is not sufficient, and so Paul further adds: <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν εὐαρέστους εἶναι</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν πᾶσιν</span>, equivalent to “<span class="ital">in all points</span>” (<a href="/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,">Titus 2:7</a> : <span class="greekheb">περὶ πάντα</span>; <a href="/colossians/3-20.htm" title=" Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.">Colossians 3:20</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a> : <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πάντα</span>), is usually joined with <span class="greekheb">εὐαρέστους εἶναι</span>; Hofmann, on the contrary, wishes to connect it with <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάσσεσθαι</span>. Both constructions are possible; still the usual one is to be preferred, because the very position of the slaves made it a matter of course that the <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάσσεσθαι</span> should be evinced in its full extent, whereas the same could not be said of <span class="greekheb">εὐαρέστοι εἶναι</span>, since that goes beyond the duty of <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάσσεσθαι</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">εὔαρεστος</span> occurs frequently in the Pauline Epistles, but only in speaking of the relation to God. The two first exhortations refer to general conduct; to these the apostle adds two special points: <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἀντιλέγοντας</span> and <span class="greekheb">μὴ νοσφιζομένους</span>. Hofmann is wrong in saying that <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἀντιλέγοντας</span> is the antithesis of <span class="greekheb">εὐαρέστους</span>. The conduct of slaves, which is well-pleasing to masters, includes more than refraining from contradiction. Van Oosterzee says not incorrectly: “It is not contradiction in particular instances, but the habitus that is here indicated.” Luther: “not contradicting.” The verb <span class="greekheb">νοσφίζεσθαι</span> is found only here and in <a href="/context/acts/5-2.htm" title="And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet....">Acts 5:2-3</a> : “<span class="ital">not pilfering, defrauding</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The next words: <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ πᾶσαν πίστιν ἐνδεικνυμένους ἀγαθήν</span> (Luther: “but showing all good fidelity”), is in the first place opposed to <span class="greekheb">μὴ νοσφιζομένους</span>, but includes more than merely to abstain from defrauding (in opposition to Hofmann). As in <a href="/titus/2-5.htm" title="To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.">Titus 2:5</a>, so, too, here, where the maintenance of the natural duties of subordinates is under discussion, the apostle adds <span class="greekheb">ἵνα τὴν διδασκαλίαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., except that the expression is now positive, whereas before it was negative; the thought is substantially the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ διδασκαλία</span> is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>] see <a href="/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1 Timothy 1:1</a>; not, as some expositors (Calvin, Wolf) think, Christ, but God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κοσμῶσιν</span>] “<span class="ital">do honour to</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν</span>] <a href="/titus/2-9.htm" title="Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;">Titus 2:9</a>, “<span class="ital">in all points</span>,” not “with all, in the eyes of all” (Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἀπὸ δόγματος δόγματα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἀπὸ πραγμάτων καὶ βίου τὰ δόγματα κρίνουσιν οἱ Ἕλληνες</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἒστωσανν ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ γυναῖκες καὶ δοῦλοι διδάσκαλοι διὰ τῆς οἰκείας ἀναστροφῆς</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/titus/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/titus/2-9.htm" title="Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;">Titus 2:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">δούλους</span>: sc. <span class="greekheb">παρακάλει</span>, <a href="/titus/2-6.htm" title="Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.">Titus 2:6</a>.
