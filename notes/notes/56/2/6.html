Among them, in respect to age, he still must be reckoned; as regarded their peculiar temptations, none could be found so fit as the still young Christian disciple of St. Paul (he ‘was probably about forty years of age when he was placed over the Cretan Church) to set out vividly before them both the peril and the only means of guarding against it. Brought up in a Pagan home, not improbably in the luxurious and wicked Syrian Antioch, drawn to the Master’s side in the fresh dawn of manhood, tried in many a difficult task and found faithful, the words of Titus, exhorting the youth of Crete to be sober-minded, or self-restrained, would be likely to have great weight. In this word, which urged self-restraint, a young man’s duty is briefly comprehended. No task, the wise Chrysostom tells us, is after all so hard and difficult for youth, as obtaining the mastery over oneself in the matter of harmful pleasures. The Apostle gives but few special directions here for his disciple’s guidance, for he is going to tell him how he will best win these young men to the side of Christ. It will be, he proceeds to show him, most effectually done by the sight of the example of his own manly, self-restrained religious life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/titus/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 Old disciples of Christ must behave in every thing agreeably to the Christian doctrine. That the aged men be sober; not thinking that the decays of nature will justify any excess; but seeking comfort from nearer communion with God, not from any undue indulgence. Faith works by, and must be seen in love, of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. Aged persons are apt to be peevish and fretful; therefore need to be on their guard. Though there is not express Scripture for every word, or look, yet there are general rules, according to which all must be ordered. Young women must be sober and discreet; for many expose themselves to fatal temptations by what at first might be only want of discretion. The reason is added, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. Failures in duties greatly reproach Christianity. Young men are apt to be eager and thoughtless, therefore must be earnestly called upon to be sober-minded: there are more young people ruined by pride than by any other sin. Every godly man's endeavour must be to stop the mouths of adversaries. Let thine own conscience answer for thine uprightness. What a glory is it for a Christian, when that mouth which would fain open itself against him, cannot find any evil in him to speak of!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/titus/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded - Margin, "discreet." On the meaning of the Greek word used here (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;  so&#772;phronein), see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>, <a href="/titus/2-4.htm">Titus 2:4</a>. The idea is, that they should be entreated to be prudent, discreet, serious in their deportment; to get the mastery over their passions and appetites; to control the propensities to which youth are subject; and that there should be such self-government, under the influence of, religion, as to avoid excess in everything. A well-governed mind, superior to the indulgence of those passions to which the young are prone, will express the meaning of the word here. They should be "steady in their behaviour, superior to sensual temptations, and constant in the exercise of every part of self-government." Doddridge. The reasons for this are obvious:<p>(1) The hopes of the church depend much on them.<p>(2) a young man who cannot govern himself, gives little promise of being useful or happy.<p>(3) Indulgence in the propensities to which young men are prone, will, sooner or later, bring ruin to the body and the soul.<p>(4) they are just at the period of life when they are exposed to special temptations, and when they need to exercise a special guardianship over their own conduct.<p>(5) like others, they may soon die; and they should be habitually in such a frame of mind, as to be prepared to stand before God. A young man who feels that he may be soon in the eternal world, cannot but be sensible of the propriety of having a serious mind, and of living and acting as in the immediate presence of his Maker and Judge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/titus/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.
