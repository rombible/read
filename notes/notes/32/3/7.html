But the very form of the royal edict is here preserved. The verse should probably run: <span class= "ital">And he caused to be proclaimed, and be published in Nineveh </span>“<span class= "ital">According to the decree of the king and his magnates be it proclaimed that,</span>” &c. The word “saying” is apparently formal like our “thus saith,” &c.<p><span class= "bld">And his nobles.</span>—For this association of the great men with the autocrat, comp. <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a>. Traces of the custom can also be discovered in Assyrian inscriptions, <span class= "ital">e.g</span>., “I am Assurbanipal king of nations, king of Assyria, Nabu-damiq and Umbadara the great men,” &c. (G. Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyrian Discoveries,</span> p. 413). Ewald thinks the formal “saying” in the edict marks the omission of the names, which in the original would be given.<p><span class= "bld">Beast.</span>—The Hebrew word is general, and might include all the domestic animals, but from the addition of “herd nor flock” we must doubtless here confine it to the <span class= "ital">horses</span> and <span class= "ital">mules,</span> &c., which even, according to our ideas, might have their usual gay housings changed to those suited to a time of mourning. “Men think it strange that the horses at Nineveh were covered with sackcloth, and forget how, at the funerals of the rich, black horses are chosen, and are clothed with black velvet” (Pusey). Herodotus (9:24) and Plutarch (Alexander), have both preserved instances in which horses and mules were associated with human beings in the signs of public mourning. The instinct which underlies the custom is a true one. Not only are the destinies of the animals which minister to man’s wants often identical with his own; but there is a <span class= "ital">bond of</span> sympathy between them naturally; and one remarkable feature of this book is the prominence given to this truth. (See <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Let them not feed. . . .</span>—Poetically, the beasts are said by Virgil to fast at the death of Daphnis (<span class= "ital">Eclog.,</span> v. 24-28), and in <a href="/joel/1-20.htm" title="The beasts of the field cry also to you: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.">Joel 1:20</a> their mute appeal against suffering is represented as audible to God. In the horror of the impending ruin of Nineveh, superstition exaggerated the true feeling underlying such representations, and to the belief in the sympathy of the lower animals with man was added the hope that their sufferings would help to appease the wrath of God.<p><span class= "bld">Let them turn.</span>—Notice the insistence on a moral change, and the implied contrast, again showing itself, with the formality of Judaism. Even in this repentance the edict does not stop to distinguish beast from man, but includes all, as all were involved in the threatened destruction.<p><span class= "bld">Violence.</span>—This is the characteristic of Assyrian manners most frequently noticed in the prophets. (See <a href="/context/nahum/2-11.htm" title="Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?">Nahum 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-1.htm" title="Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departs not;">Nahum 3:1</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/10-13.htm" title="For he said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:">Isaiah 10:13-14</a>.) The cuneiform inscriptions abundantly illustrate this point. Take this for example from an inscription of Tiglath Pileser II.: “Tiglath Pileser, the great king, the powerful king, king of nations, &c, the powerful warrior who in the service of Assur his lord the whole of his haters has trampled on like clay, swept like a flood, and reduced to shadows” (G. Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyrian Discoveries,</span> p. 254).<p><span class= "bld">In their hands.</span>—Comp. <a href="/psalms/7-3.htm" title="O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;">Psalm 7:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Who can tell</span> . . .<span class= "bld">?</span>—This sudden recognition of <span class= "ital">one</span> God by a king of Nineveh appears far more striking if contrasted with the long lists of deities usually mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, <span class= "ital">e.g</span>., “By command of Assur, Sin, Shamas, Vul, Bel, Nebo, Ishtar of Nineveh, Sarrat-Kitmuri, Ishtar of Arbela, Ninip, Nergal, and Nusku, into Minni I entered and marched victoriously” (from the <span class= "ital">Cylinder of Assurbanipal,</span> Smith, p. 333).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jonah/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jonah/3-7.htm" title="And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:...">Jonah 3:7-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let neither man nor beast taste any thing — </span>This was ordered to add the greater solemnity to the humiliation, and that men might be affected by the mournful cries of the cattle under such restraints, and thereby be moved to greater sorrow and contrition. It was, however, carrying their abstinence to a greater severity than we find practised among the Jews; for though, in times of public calamity, and on the day of solemn expiation, they made their children fast, as we may gather from <a href="/joel/2-16.htm" title="Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.">Joel 2:16</a>, yet we nowhere read of their extending that rigour to cattle. <span class="ital">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth — </span>Their horses and camels, both which they had been accustomed to adorn with rich and costly clothing, they must now clothe with sackcloth, in testimony of a hearty repentance; the clothing of the beasts must witness for the men. Thus, in funerals, the covering horses and mules with sackcloth adds to the solemnity of the occasion, and tends to increase the sorrow. <span class="ital">And cry mightily </span>— That is, let the men cry; for though the men and beasts are spoken of promiscuously in this proclamation, yet there are some expressions which are to be applied peculiarly to the men. <span class="ital">Yea, let every one turn from his evil way — </span>Let every one forsake his vicious practices. <span class="ital">And from the violence that is in their hands — </span>Let him cease to defraud or oppress his fellow-creatures, and desist from all acts of violence; yea, and let him restore what he has gotten by such practices. Natural religion instructed them, that their earnest prayers, without true amendment, would not avail them before God; nor would their repentance be thought sincere, unless they restored to the true owners what they had gained by violence and injustice. <span class="ital">Who can tell if God will turn and repent? — </span>That is, whether he will change his way toward us, and revoke the sentence gone forth against us. It was a great thing for these heathen to give such proofs of repentance, under an uncertain hope of pardon.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jonah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:5-10 There was a wonder of Divine grace in the repentance and reformation of Nineveh. It condemns the men of the gospel generation, Mt 12:41. A very small degree of light may convince men that humbling themselves before God, confessing their sins with prayer, and turning from sin, are means of escaping wrath and obtaining mercy. The people followed the example of the king. It became a national act, and it was necessary it should be so, when it was to prevent a national ruin. Let even the brute creatures' cries and moans for want of food remind their owners to cry to God. In prayer we must cry mightily, with fixedness of thought, firmness of faith, and devout affections. It concerns us in prayer to stir up all that is within us. It is not enough to fast for sin, but we must fast from sin; and, in order to the success of our prayers, we must no more regard iniquity in our hearts, Ps 66:18. The work of a fast-day is not done with the day. The Ninevites hoped that God would turn from his fierce anger; and that thus their ruin would be prevented. They could not be so confident of finding mercy upon their repentance, as we may be, who have the death and merits of Christ, to which we may trust for pardon upon repentance. They dared not presume, but they did not despair. Hope of mercy is the great encouragement to repentance and reformation. Let us boldly cast ourselves down at the footstool of free grace, and God will look upon us with compassion. God sees who turn from their evil ways, and who do not. Thus he spared Nineveh. We read of no sacrifices offered to God to make atonement for sin; but a broken and a contrite heart, such as the Ninevites then had, he will not despise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh; - literally, "And he cried and said, etc." The cry or proclamation of the king corresponded with the cry of Jonah. Where the prophet's cry, calling to repentance, had reached, the proclamation of the king followed, obeying. "By the decree of the king and his nobles." This is a hint of the political state of Nineveh, beyond what we have elsewhere. It was not then an absolute monarchy. At least, the king strengthened his command by that of his nobles, as Darius the Mede sealed the den of lions, into which Daniel was cast, with the signet of his lords as well as his own <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>, "that the purpose might not be changed concerning him."<p>Let neither man nor beast ... - o "Are brutes too then to fast, horses and mules to be clothed with sackcloth? Yes, he says. For as, when a rich man dies, his relatives clothe not only the men and maidservants, but the horses too with sackcloth, and, giving them to the grooms, bid that they should follow to the tomb, in token of the greatness of the calamity and inviting all to sympathy, so also when that city was about to perish, they clad the brute natures in sackcloth, and put them under the yoke of fasting. The irrational animals cannot, through words, learn the anger of God; let them learn through hunger, that the infliction is from God: for if, he says, the city should be overthrown, it would be one grave of us the inhabitants and of them also." It was no arbitrary nor wanton nor careless act of the king of Nineveh to make the mute animals share in the common fast. It proceeded probably from an indistinct consciousness that God cared for them also, and, that "they" were not guilty. So the Psalmist looked on God's care of His creatures as a fresh ground for man's trust in Him <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6-7</a>, "O Lord, Thou preservest man and beast: How excellent is Thy lovingkindness, O Lord, therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Thy wings." As our Lord teaches that God's care of the sparrows is a pledge to man of God's minute unceasing care for him, so the Ninevites felt truly that the cry of the poor brutes would be heard by God. And God confirmed that judgment, when He told Jonah of the "much cattle ," as a ground for having pity on Nineveh. The moanings and lowings of the animals, their voices of distress, pierce man's heart too, and must have added to his sense of the common misery. Ignorance or pride of human nature alone could think that man's sorrow is not aided by these objects of sense. Nature was truer in the king of Nineveh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. neither &#8230; beast &#8230; taste any thing&#8212;The brute creatures share in the evil effects of man's sin (Jon 4:11; Ro 8:20, 22); so they here according to Eastern custom, are made to share in man's outward indications of humiliation.

It is literally, “<span class="bld">And he caused a proclamation to be made, and said</span>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the decree</span>] The word here used is not properly a Hebrew word. It occurs frequently in the Chaldee of Daniel and Ezra to denote a mandate or decree of the Babylonish and Persian monarchs. Dr Pusey rightly sees in the employment of it here a proof of the “accuracy” of Jonah as a writer. He observes, “This is a Syriac word; and accordingly, since it has now been ascertained beyond all question that the language of Nineveh was a dialect of Syriac, it was, with a Hebrew pronunciation (the vowel points are different here from those in Daniel and Ezra), the very word used of this decree at Nineveh.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and his nobles</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">his great men</span>, or grandees, <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm" title="A man's gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.">Proverbs 18:16</a>. We have a similar association of his nobles with himself by Darius the Mede, when he caused the stone which was laid upon the mouth of the den, into which Daniel had been cast, to be sealed “with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel” (<a href="/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a>). In the present case, however, it would seem that it was not in the exercise of a constitutional right, but by a voluntary act on the part of the king, that the nobles were associated with him in the edict which he issued. Kalisch observes, “It would be unsafe to infer from this passage that the nobles were in some manner constitutionally connected with the government of the kingdom, and thus tempered its arbitrariness, as we know now from the monuments, no less than from the records of history, that ‘the Assyrian monarch was a thorough Eastern despot, unchecked by popular opinion, and having complete power over the lives and property of his subjects, rather adored as a god than feared as a man.’ ” (Layard, <span class="ital">Nin. and Babyl.</span> p. 632). May not this association of his nobles with himself have been “fruit meet for repentance,” an abdication, in some sort, of the haughty arbitrariness of his power, an humbling of himself “under the mighty hand of God”?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">saying</span>] The decree, thus introduced, extends to the end of <span class="ital"><a href="/jonah/3-9.htm" title="Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?">Jonah 3:9</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">man nor beast, herd nor flock</span>] The Hebrew word for “beast” here means tame or domestic animals, and probably refers only to “beasts of burden,” horses, mules, and the like. So Ahab says to Obadiah when the famine was in Samaria, “peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we be not deprived of beasts” (<a href="/1_kings/18-5.htm" title="And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.">1 Kings 18:5</a>). “Herd and flock” will then be an additional clause, not amplifying, but distinct from “beast,” and the covering with sackcloth, in <span class="ital"><a href="/jonah/3-8.htm" title="But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God: yes, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.">Jonah 3:8</a></span>, will thus be confined to those animals which were in man’s more immediate use, and many of which, with their gay and costly trappings and harness, had been the ministers of his pomp and pride, or, as employed in war, had been the instruments of his “violence.” The extension of the fast to all, and of the sackcloth to some at least, of the animals in Nineveh, is probably without exact parallel in extant history. The <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span> rightly points out that “the <span class="ital">voluntary</span> fasting of animals, wild as well as tame, at the death of Daphnis, described by Virgil, <span class="ital">Eclog.</span> v. 24–28, which has often been referred to, is plainly a mere poetic fancy.” But the description in the text is quite in keeping with the common instinct and practice of mankind. Men have always been wont to extend the outward signs of their joy or sorrow to everything under their control. Our dress, our food, our houses, our equipage, our horses, our servants, all wear the hue of the occasion for which they are employed. “Man, in his luxury and pride, would have everything reflect his glory and minister to pomp. Self-humiliation would have everything reflect its lowliness. Sorrow would have everything answer to its sorrow. Men think it strange that the horses at Nineveh were covered with sackcloth, and forget how, at the funerals of the rich, black horses are chosen, and are clothed with black velvet” (Pusey). In the extreme case of Nineveh, the instinct may well have been indulged to an extreme. Like all other common instincts of our nature, it had a true origin, for the destiny of man and of the lower creation is inseparably connected (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>; <a href="/context/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God....">Romans 8:19-23</a>). The effect upon the Ninevites of seeing “their deserts set before them as in a mirror or a picture” (Calvin), all that belonged to them involved with them, through their guilt, in a common danger with themselves—all creation, as it were, threatened and humbled for the sin of its lord—may well have been to incite them powerfully to repentance. The appeal to the compassion of Almighty God, who “preserveth man and beast” (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>; comp. ch. <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>), may well have been strengthened by the mute misery of the innocent beasts (<a href="/joel/1-20.htm" title="The beasts of the field cry also to you: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.">Joel 1:20</a>) But, apart from these considerations, the requirements of the history are fully satisfied by regarding the act of the king of Nineveh as instinctive, called for by the urgent circumstances of the case, and coloured by the demonstrativeness of oriental character.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He caused it,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">he caused proclamation to be made, and said, i.e.</span> by the heralds. <span class="cmt_word">The decree.</span> The word used here (<span class="accented">taam</span>) is an Accadian term, which had become naturalized in Assyria, Persia, and Babylonia, and was applied to a mandate issued with royal authority.

These great cities contained in their area immense open spaces, like our parks, where cattle were kept. The dumb animals were made to share in their masters' fast and sorrow, as they shared their joy and feasting; their bleating and bellowing were so many appeals to Heaven for mercy; the punishment of these innocent creatures was a kind of atonement for the guilt of their lords (comp. <a href="/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>; <a href="/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; and note how the brute creation is said to sham in the happiness of paradise regained, <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>.). The commentators quote Virgil, 'Ecl.,' 5:24, etc., where, however, the point is that the grief of the shepherds hinders them from attending to the wants of their flocks. Herodotus (9:24) mentions an instance of the Persians cutting the manes and tails of their horses and mules in a case of general mourning (comp. Eurip., 'Alcest.,' 428, etc.; Plut., 'Alex.,' 72). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But as Israel would not desist from its idolatrous worship, Jehovah would also continue to visit the people with judgments, as He had already done, though without effecting any conversion to their God. This last thought is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a> in a series of instances, in which the expression &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491;&#1497; (and ye have not returned to me), which is repeated five times, depicts in the most thorough manner the unwearied love of the Lord to His rebellious children.<p><a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6</a><p>"And I have also given you cleanness of teeth in all your towns, and want of bread in all your places: and ye have not returned to me, is the saying of Jehovah."

Cleanness of teeth is explained by the parallel "want of bread." The first chastisement, therefore, consisted in famine, with which God visited the nation, as He had threatened the transgressors that He would do in the law (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-57.htm">Deuteronomy 28:57</a>).
