and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did it not.">Jonah 3:10</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This passage falls into three parts: Jonah’s renewed commission and new obedience {<a href="/jonah/3-1.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,">Jonah 3:1</a> - <a href="/jonah/3-4.htm" title="And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.">Jonah 3:4</a>}, the repentance of Nineveh {<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm" title="So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.">Jonah 3:5</a> - <a href="/jonah/3-9.htm" title="Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?">Jonah 3:9</a>}, and the acceptance thereof by God {<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm" title="And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did it not.">Jonah 3:10</a>}. We might almost call these three the repentance of Jonah, of Nineveh, and of God. The evident intention of the narrative is to parallel the Ninevites turning from their sins, and God’s turning from His anger and purpose of destruction; and if the word ‘repentance’ is not applied to Jonah, his conduct sufficiently shows the thing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Note the renewed charge to the penitent Prophet, and his new eagerness to fulfil it.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> His deliverance and second commission are put as if all but simultaneous, and his obedience was swift and glad. Jonah did not venture to take for granted that the charge which he had shirked was still continued to him. If God commands to take the trumpet, and we refuse, we dare not assume that we shall still be honoured with the delivery of the message. The punishment of dumb lips is often dumbness. Opportunities of service, slothfully or faintheartedly neglected, are often withdrawn. We can fancy how Jonah, brought back to the better mind which breathes in his psalm, longed to be honoured by the trust of preaching once more, and how rapturously his spirit would address itself to the task. Duties once unwelcome become sweet when we have passed through the experience of the misery that comes from neglecting them. It is God’s mercy that gives us the opportunity of effacing past disobedience by new alacrity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second charge is possibly distinguishable from the first as being less precise. It may be that the exact nature of ‘the preaching that I bid thee’ was not told Jonah till he had to open his mouth in Nineveh; but, more probably, the second charge was identical with the first.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The word rendered ‘preach’ is instructive. It means ‘to cry’ and suggests the manner befitting those who bear God’s message. They should sound it out loudly, plainly, urgently, with earnestness and marks of emotion in their voice. Languid whispers will not wake sleepers. Unless the messenger is manifestly in earnest, the message will fall flat. Not with bated breath, as if ashamed of it; nor with hesitation, as if not quite sure of it; nor with coldness, as if it were of little urgency,-is God’s Word to be pealed in men’s ears. The preacher is a crier. The substance of his message, too, is set forth. ‘The preaching which I bid thee’-not his own imaginations, nor any fine things of his own spinning. Suppose Jonah had entertained the Ninevites with dissertations on the evidences of his prophetic authority, or submitted for their consideration a few thoughts tending to show the agreement of his message with their current opinions in religion, or an argument for the existence of a retributive Governor of the world, he would not have shaken the city. The less the Prophet shows himself, the stronger his influence. The more simply he repeats the stern, plain, short message, the more likely it is to impress. God’s Word, faithfully set forth, will prove itself. The preacher or teacher of this day has substantially the same charge as Jonah had; and the more he suppresses himself, and becomes but a voice through which God speaks, the better for himself, his hearers, and his work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Nineveh, that great aggregate of cities, was full, as Eastern cities are, of open spaces, and might well be a three days’ journey in circumference. What a task for that solitary stranger to thunder out his loud cry among all these crowds! But he had learned to do what he was bid; and without wasting a moment, he ‘began to enter into the city a day’s journey,’ and, no doubt, did not wait till the end of the day to proclaim his message. Let us learn that there is an element of threatening in God’s most merciful message, and that the appeal to terror and to the desire for self-preservation is part of the way to preach the Gospel. Plain warnings of coming evil may be spoken tenderly, and reveal love as truly as the most soothing words. The warning comes in time. ‘Forty days’ of grace are granted. The gospel warns us in time enough for escape. It warns us because God loves; and they are as untrue messengers of His love as of His justice who slur over the declaration of His wrath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Note the repentance of Nineveh</span> {<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm" title="So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.">Jonah 3:5</a> - <a href="/jonah/3-9.htm" title="Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?">Jonah 3:9</a>}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The impression made by Jonah’s terrible cry is perfectly credible and natural in the excitable population of an Eastern city, in which even now any appeal to terror, especially if associated with religious and prophetic claims, easily sets the whole in a frenzy. Think of the grim figure of this foreign man, with his piercing voice and half-intelligible speech, dropped from the clouds as it were, and stalking through Nineveh, pealing out his confident message, like that gaunt fanatic who walked Jerusalem in its last agony, crying, ‘Woe! woe unto the bloody city!’ or that other, who, with flaming fire on his head and madness in his eyes, affrighted London in the plague. No wonder that alarm was kindled, and, being kindled, spread like wildfire. Apparently the movement was first among the people, who began to fast before the news penetrated to the seclusion of the palace. But the contagion reached the king, and the popular excitement was endorsed and fanned by a royal decree. The specified tokens of repentance are those of ordinary mourning, such as were common all over the East, with only the strange addition, which smacks of heathen ideas, that the animals were made sharers in them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is great significance in that ‘believed God’ {<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm" title="So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.">Jonah 3:5</a>}. The foundation of all true repentance is crediting God’s word of threatening, and therefore realising the danger, as well as the disobedience, of our sin. We shall be wise if we pass by the human instrument, and hear God speaking through the Prophet. Never mind about Jonah, believe God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We learn from the Ninevites what is true repentance They brought no sacrifices or offerings, but sorrow, self-abasement, and amendment. The characteristic sin of a great military power would be ‘violence,’ and that is the specific evil from which they vow to turn. The loftiest lesson which prophets found Israel so slow to learn, ‘A broken and a contrite heart Thou wilt not despise,’ was learned by these heathens. We need it no less. Nineveh repented on a peradventure that their repentance might avail. How pathetic that ‘Who can tell?’ {<a href="/jonah/3-9.htm" title="Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?">Jonah 3:9</a>} is! We <span class="ital">know</span> what they <span class="ital">hoped</span>. Their doubt might give fervour to their cries, but our certainty should give deeper earnestness and confidence to ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The deepest meaning of the whole narrative is set forth in our Lord’s use of it, when He holds up the men of Nineveh as a condemnatory instance to the hardened consciences of His hearers. Probably the very purpose of the book was to show Israel that the despised and yet dreaded heathen were more susceptible to the voice of God than they were: ‘I will provoke you to jealousy by them which are no people.’ The story was a smiting blow to the proud exclusiveness and self-complacent contempt of prophetic warnings, which marked the entire history of God’s people. As Ezekiel was told: ‘Thou are not sent . . . to many peoples of a strange speech and of an hard language. . . . Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee. But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee.’ It is ever true that long familiarity with the solemn thoughts of God’s judgment and punishment of sin abates their impression on us. Our Puritan forefathers used to talk about ‘gospel-hardened sinners,’ and there are many such among us. The man who lives by Niagara does not hear its roar as a stranger does. The men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with other generations than that which was ‘this generation’ in Christ’s time; and that which is ‘this generation’ to-day will, in many of its members, be condemned by them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the wave of feeling soon retired, and there is no reason to believe that more than a transient impression was made. It does not seem certain that the Ninevites knew what ‘God’ they hoped to appease. Probably their pantheon was undisturbed, and their repentance lasted no longer than their fear. Transient repentance leaves the heart harder than before, as half-melted ice freezes again more dense. Let us beware of frost on the back of a thaw. ‘Repentance which is repented of’ is worse than none.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. We note the repentance of God</span> {<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm" title="And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did it not.">Jonah 3:10</a>}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Mark the recurrence of the word ‘turn,’ employed in <a href="/jonah/3-8.htm" title="But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God: yes, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.">Jonah 3:8</a> - <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm" title="And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did it not.">Jonah 3:10</a> in reference to men and to God. Mark the bold use of the word ‘repent,’ applied to God, which, though it be not applied to the Ninevites in the previous verses, is implied in every line of them. The same expression is found in <a href="/exodus/32-14.htm" title="And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.">Exodus 32:14</a>, which may be taken as the classical passage warranting its use. The great truth involved is one that is too often lost sight of in dealing with prophecy; namely, that all God’s promises and threatenings are conditional. Jeremiah learned that lesson in the house of the potter, and we need to keep it well in mind. God threatens, precisely in order that He may not have to perform His threatenings. Jonah was sent to Nineveh to cry, ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,’ in order that it might not be overthrown. What would have been the use of proclaiming the decree, if it had been irreversible? There is an implied ‘if’ in all God’s words. ‘Except ye repent’ underlies the most absolute threatenings of evil. ‘If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end,’ is presupposed in the brightest and broadest promises of good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The word ‘repent’ is denied and affirmed to have application to God. He is not ‘a son of man, that He should repent,’ inasmuch as His immutability and steadfast purpose know no variableness. But just because they cannot change, and He must ever be against them that do evil, and ever bless them that turn to Him with trust, therefore He changes His dealings with us according to our relation to Him, and because He cannot repent, or be other than He was and is, ‘repents of the evil that He had said that He would do’ unto sinners when they repent of the evil that they have done against Him, inasmuch as He leaves His threatening unfulfilled, and ‘does it not.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So we might almost say that the purpose of this book of Jonah is to teach the possibility and efficacy of repentance, and to show how the penitent man, heathen or Jew, ever finds in God changed dealings corresponding to his changed heart. The widest charity, the humbling lesson for people brought up in the blaze of revelation, that dwellers in the twilight or in the darkness are dear to God and may be more susceptible of divine impressions than ourselves, the rebuke of all pluming ourselves on our privileges, the boundlessness of God’s mercy, are among the other lessons of this strange book; but none of them is more precious than its truly evangelic teaching of the blessedness of true penitence, whether exemplified in the renegade Prophet returning to his high mission, or the fierce Ninevites humbled and repentant, and finding mercy from the God of the whole earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jonah/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/jonah/3-1.htm" title="And the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,...">Jonah 3:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the word of the Lord, </span>&c. — After Jonah had been well chastised for his disobedience, and was set at liberty, as recorded in the preceding chapter, the divine call to him to prophesy was repeated. He had rebelled against God’s command the first time, but now, being humbled and better prepared, he is tried again. <span class="ital">So — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">And, Jonah arose and went into Nineveh — </span>He now obeys without reluctance. Such was the blessed fruit of the correction which he had received. <span class="ital">Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city — </span>The Hebrew reads, <span class="ital">A great city to God: </span>so <span class="ital">the mountains of God </span>are the same with <span class="ital">great mountains, </span><a href="/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>, and the <span class="ital">cedars of God </span>are translated <span class="ital">goodly cedars, </span><a href="/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>. Nineveh was the greatest city in the known world at that time; greater than Babylon, whose compass was then three hundred and eighty-five furlongs; but Nineveh was in compass four hundred and eighty furlongs, which makes something more than sixty of our miles. It is said that its walls were one hundred feet in height, and broad enough for three coaches to meet and pass safely by each other: that it had one thousand five hundred towers on its walls, each two hundred feet high. Diodorus Siculus represents it as an oblong figure, the two longer sides of which measured one hundred and fifty stadia, and the two shorter ninety. “Ninus,” says he, “hastened to build a city of such magnitude, that it should not only be the greatest which then existed in the whole world, but that none in succeeding ages, who undertook such a work, should easily surpass it; and his expectation has not been deceived. For no one has since built so great a city; both as to the extent of its circuit, and the magnificence of its wall.” According to a report recorded by Eustathius, fourteen myriads of men were employed for eight years in building this city. It is here said, that it was of <span class="ital">three days’ journey; </span>and Diodorus asserts the same; that is, of three days’ journey in circuit, allowing twenty miles to each day. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jonah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-4 God employs Jonah again in his service. His making use of us is an evidence of his being at peace with us. Jonah was not disobedient, as he had been. He neither endeavoured to avoid hearing the command, nor declined to obey it. See here the nature of repentance; it is the change of our mind and way, and a return to our work and duty. Also, the benefit of affliction; it brings those back to their place who had deserted it. See the power of Divine grace, for affliction of itself would rather drive men from God, than draw them to him. God's servants must go where he sends them, come when he calls them, and do what he bids them; we must do whatever the word of the Lord commands. Jonah faithfully and boldly delivered his errand. Whether Jonah said more, to show the anger of God against them, or whether he only repeated these words again and again, is not certain, but this was the purport of his message. Forty days is a long time for a righteous God to delay judgments, yet it is but a little time for an unrighteous people to repent and reform in. And should it not awaken us to get ready for death, to consider that we cannot be so sure that we shall live forty days, as Nineveh then was that it should stand forty days? We should be alarmed if we were sure not to live a month, yet we are careless though we are not sure to live a day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the word of the Lord came a second time to Jonah - o "Jonah, delivered from the whale, doubtless went up to Jerusalem to pay his vows and thank God there. Perhaps he hoped that God would be content with this his punishment and repentance, and that He would not again send him to Nineveh." Anyway, he was in some settled home, perhaps again at Gath-hepher. For God bids him, "Arise, go" . "But one who is on his way, is not bidden to arise and go." God may have allowed an interval to elapse, in order that the tidings of so great a miracle might spread far and wide. But Jonah does not supply any of these incidents . He does not speak of himself , but only of his mission, as God taught him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Jon 3:1-10.

That in the day when I visit the transgressions of the house of Israel upon it, I shall visit it upon the altars of Bethel; and the horns of the altar will be cut off, and fall to the ground. <a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>. And I smite the winter-house over the summer-house, and the houses of ivory perish, and many houses vanish, is the saying of Jehovah." The words "Hear ye" cannot be addressed to the Israelites, fore they could not bear witness against the house of Israel, but must either refer to the prophets, as in <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a> ("publish ye"), or to the heathen, in which case they correspond to "assemble yourselves and behold" in <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>. The latter assumption is the only correct one, for the context does not assign a sufficient motive for an address to the prophets. On the other hand, as the heathen have been summoned to convince themselves by actual observation of the sins that prevail in Samaria, it is perfectly in keeping that they should now hear what is the punishment that God is about to inflict upon Israel in consequence, and that they should bear witness against Israel from what they have heard. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1491; &#1489;, to bear witness towards or against (not "in," as Baur supposes). The house of Jacob is the whole of Israel, of the twelve tribes, as in <a href="/amos/3-1.htm">Amos 3:1</a>; for Judah was also to learn a lesson from the destruction of Samaria. As the appeal to the heathen to bear witness against Israel indicates the greatness of the sins of the Israelites, so, on the other hand, does the accumulation of the names of God in <a href="/amos/3-13.htm">Amos 3:13</a> serve to strengthen the declaration made by the Lord, who possesses as God of hosts the power to execute His threats. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the substance of what is to be heard. The punishment of the sins of Israel is to extend even to the altars of Bethel, the seat of the idolatrous image-worship, the hearth and home of the religious and moral corruption of the ten tribes. The smiting off of the horns of the altar is the destruction of the altars themselves, the significance of which culminated in the horns (see at <a href="/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>). The singular hammizbe&#772;a&#774;ch (the altar) preceded by a plural is the singular of species (cf. Ges. 108, 1), and does not refer to any particular one - say, for example, to the principal altar. The destruction of the palaces and houses (<a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>) takes place in the capital. In the reference to the winter-house and summer-house, we have to think primarily of the royal palace (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a>); at the same time, wealthy noblemen may also have had them. &#1506;&#1500;, lit., over, so that the ruins of one house fall upon the top of another; then "together with," as in <a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1503;, ivory houses, houses the rooms of which are decorated by inlaid ivory. Ahab had a palace of this kind (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>, compare <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, not the large houses, but many houses; for the description is rounded off with these words. Along with the palaces, many houses will also fall to the ground. The fulfilment took place when Samaria was taken by Shalmanezer (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>). </body></html>
