His making use of us is an evidence of his being at peace with us. Jonah was not disobedient, as he had been. He neither endeavoured to avoid hearing the command, nor declined to obey it. See here the nature of repentance; it is the change of our mind and way, and a return to our work and duty. Also, the benefit of affliction; it brings those back to their place who had deserted it. See the power of Divine grace, for affliction of itself would rather drive men from God, than draw them to him. God's servants must go where he sends them, come when he calls them, and do what he bids them; we must do whatever the word of the Lord commands. Jonah faithfully and boldly delivered his errand. Whether Jonah said more, to show the anger of God against them, or whether he only repeated these words again and again, is not certain, but this was the purport of his message. Forty days is a long time for a righteous God to delay judgments, yet it is but a little time for an unrighteous people to repent and reform in. And should it not awaken us to get ready for death, to consider that we cannot be so sure that we shall live forty days, as Nineveh then was that it should stand forty days? We should be alarmed if we were sure not to live a month, yet we are careless though we are not sure to live a day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arise, go to Nineveh that great city, and preach (or cry) unto it - God says to Jonah the self-same words which He had said before; only perhaps He gives him an intimation of His purpose of mercy, in that he says no more, "cry against her," but "cry unto her." He might "cry against" one doomed to destruction; to "cry unto her," seems to imply that she had some interest in, and so some hope from, this cry. "The preaching that I bid thee." This is the only notice which Jonah relates that God took of his disobedience, in that He charged him to obey exactly what He commanded . "He does not say to him, why didst thou not what I commanded?" He had rebuked him in deed; He amended him and upbraided him not . "The rebuke of that shipwreck and the swallowing by the fish sufficed, so that he who had not felt the Lord commanding, might understand Him, delivering."<p>Jonah might have seemed unworthy to be again inspired by God. But "whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth;" whom He chasteneth, He loveth . "The hard discipline, the severity and length of the scourge, were the earnests of a great trust and a high destination." He knew him to be changed into another man, and, by one of His most special favors, gives him that same trust which he had before deserted . "As Christ, when risen, commended His sheep to Peter, wiser now and more fervent, so to Jonah risen He commends the conversion of Nineveh. For so did Christ risen bring about the conversion of the pagan, by sending His Apostles, each into large provinces, as Jonah was sent alone to a large city" . "He bids him declare not only the sentence of God, but in the same words; not to consider his own estimation or the ears of his hearers, nor to mingle soothing with severe words, and convey the message ingeniously, but with all freedom and severity to declare openly what was commanded him. This plainness, though, may be less acceptable to people or princes, is ofttimes more useful, always more approved by God. Nothing should be more sacred to the preacher of God's word, than truth and simplicity and inviolable sanctity in delivering it. Now alas, all this is changed into vain show at the will of the multitude and the breath of popular favor." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. preach &#8230; the preaching&#8212;literally, "proclaim the proclamation."

The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by His holiness: behold, days come upon you, that they drag you away with hooks, and your last one with fish-hooks. <a href="/amos/4-3.htm">Amos 4:3</a>. And ye will go out through breaches in the wall, every one before him, and be cast away to Harmon, is the saying of Jehovah." The commencement of this chapter is closely connected, so far as the contents are concerned, with the chapter immediately preceding. The prophet having there predicted, that when the kingdom was conquered by its enemies, the voluptuous grandees would perish, with the exception of a very few who would hardly succeed in saving their lives, turns now to the voluptuous women of Samaria, to predict in their case a shameful transportation into exile. The introduction, "Hear this word," does not point therefore to a new prophecy, but simply to a fresh stage in the prophecy, so that we cannot even agree with Ewald in taking <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1-3</a> as the conclusion of the previous prophecy (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-1.htm">Amos 3:1-15</a>). The cows of Bashan are well-fed, fat cows, &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, vaccae pingues (Symm., Jer.), as Bashan had fat pastures, and for that reason the tribes that were richest in flocks and herds had asked for it as their inheritance (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>). The fuller definitions which follow show very clearly that by the cows of Bashan, Amos meant the rich, voluptuous, and violent inhabitants of Samaria. It is doubtful, however, whether he meant the rich and wanton wives of the great, as most of the modern commentators follow Theodor., Theodoret, and others, in assuming; or "the rulers of Israel, and all the leading men of the ten tribes, who spent their time in pleasure and robbery" (Jerome); or "those rich, luxurious, and lascivious inhabitants of the palace of whom he had spoken in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9-10</a>" (Maurer), as the Chald., Luther, Calvin, and others suppose, and whom he calls cows, not oxen, to denote their effeminacy and their unbridled licentiousness. In support of the latter opinion we might adduce not only <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>, where Ephraim is compared to a young heifer, but also the circumstance that from <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a> onwards the prophecy refers to the Israelites as a whole. But neither of these arguments proves very much. The simile in <a href="/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a> applies to Ephraim as a kingdom of people, and the natural personification as a woman prepares the way for the comparison to an &#8219;egla&#770;h; whereas voluptuous and tyrannical grandees would be more likely to be compared to the bulls of Bashan (<a href="/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>). And so, again, the transition in <a href="/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a> to the Israelites as a whole furnishes no help in determining more precisely who are addressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1-3</a>. By the cows of Bashan, therefore, we understand the voluptuous women of Samaria, after the analogy of <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9-13</a>, more especially because it is only by forcing the last clause of <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> that it can be understood as referring to men. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, because the verb stands first (compare <a href="/isaiah/32-11.htm">Isaiah 32:11</a>). The mountain of Samaria is mentioned in the place of the city built upon the mountain (see at <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>). The sin of these women consisted in the tyrannical oppression of the poor, whilst they asked their lords, i.e., their husbands, to procure them the means of debauchery. For &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; and &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, compare <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3-4</a>, where the two words are already connected. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; stands in the singular, because every wife speaks in this way to her husband.<p>The announcement of the punishment for such conduct is introduced with a solemn oath, to make an impression, if possible, upon the hardened hearts. Jehovah swears by His holiness, i.e., as the Holy One, who cannot tolerate unrighteousness. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (for) before &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; introduces the oath. Hitzig takes &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; as a niphal, as in the similar formula in <a href="/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17</a>; but he takes it as a passive used impersonally with an accusative, after <a href="/genesis/35-26.htm">Genesis 35:26</a> and other passages (though not <a href="/exodus/13-7.htm">Exodus 13:7</a>). But as &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; unquestionably occurs as a piel in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>, it is more natural to take the same form as a piel in this instance also, and whilst interpreting it impersonally, to think of the enemy as understood. Tsinno&#772;th  equals  tsinn&#305;&#772;m, <a href="/proverbs/22-5.htm">Proverbs 22:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;  equals  &#1510;&#1468;&#1503;, thorns, hence hooks; so also s&#305;&#772;ro&#772;th  equals  s&#305;&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, thorns, <a href="/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>. Du&#772;ga&#770;h, fishery; hence s&#305;&#772;ro&#772;th du&#772;ga&#770;h, fish-hooks. 'Acha&#774;r&#305;&#772;th does not mean posterity, or the young brood that has grown up under the instruction and example of the parents (Hitzig), but simply "the end," the opposite of re&#772;'sh&#305;&#772;th, the beginning. It is "end," however, in different senses. Here it signifies the remnant (Chaldee), i.e., those who remain and are not dragged away with tsinno&#772;th; so that the thought expressed is "all, even to the very last" (compare Hengstenberg, Christology, i. p. 368). &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1503; has a feminine suffix, whereas masculine suffixes were used before (&#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;); the universal gender, out of which the feminine was first formed. The figure is not taken from animals, into whose noses hooks and rings are inserted to tame them, or from large fishes that are let down into the water again by nose-hooks; for the technical terms applied to these hooks are &#1495;&#1495;, &#1495;&#1493;&#1495;, and &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-2</a>); but from the catching of fishes, that are drawn out of the fish-pond with hooks. Thus shall the voluptuous, wanton women be violently torn away or carried off from the midst of the superfluity and debauchery in which they lived as in their proper element. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, to go out of rents in the wall, &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; being construed, as it frequently is, with the accusative of the place; we should say, "though rents in the wall," i.e., through breaches made in the wall at the taking of the city, not out at the gates, because they had been destroyed or choked up with rubbish at the storming of the city. "Every one before her," i.e., without looking round to the right or to the left (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>, <a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>). The words &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; are difficult, on account of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, and have not yet been satisfactorily explained. The form &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is probably chosen simply for the purpose of obtaining a resemblance in sound to &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, and is sustained by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is applied to thrusting into exile, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27</a>.<p>The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; with &#1492; htiw  loc. appears to indicate the place to which they were to be carried away or cast out. But the hiphil &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; does not suit this, and consequently nearly all the earlier translators have rendered it as a passive, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;-&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; (lxx), projiciemini (Jerome); so also the Syr. and Chald. &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, "men will carry them away captive." One Hebrew codex actually gives the hophal. And to this reading we must adhere; for the hiphil furnishes no sense at all, since the intransitive or reflective meaning, to plunge, or cast one's self, cannot be sustained, and is not supported at all by the passages quoted by Hitzig, viz., <a href="/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a> and <a href="/job/27-22.htm">Job 27:22</a>; and still less does haharmo&#772;na&#770;h denote the object cast away by the women when they go into captivity.<p>(Note: The Masoretic pointing probably originated in the idea that harmo&#772;na&#770;h, corresponding to the talmudic harma&#770;na&#770;', signifies royal power or dominion, and so Rashi interprets it: "ye will cast away the authority, i.e., the almost regal authority, or that pride and arrogance with which you bear yourselves to-day" (Ros.). This explanation would be admissible, if it were not that the use of a word which never occurs again in the old Hebrew for a thing so frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, rendered it very improbable. At any rate, it is more admissible than the different conjectures of the most recent commentators. Thus Hitzig, for example (Comm. ed. 3), would resolve haharmo&#772;na&#770;h into ha&#770;ha&#770;r and mo&#772;na&#770;h  equals  meo&#772;na&#770;h ("and ye will plunge headlong to the mountain as a place of refuge"). The objections to this are, (1) that hishl&#305;&#772;kh does not mean to plunge headlong; (2) the improbability of meo&#772;na&#770;h being contracted into mo&#772;na&#770;h, when Amos has meo&#772;na&#770;h in <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>; and lastly, the fact that meo&#772;na&#770;h means simply a dwelling, not a place of refuge. Ewald would read ha&#770;ha&#770;r rimmo&#772;na&#770;h after the lxx, and renders it, "ye will cast Rimmonah to the mountain," understanding by Rimmonah a female deity of the Syrians. But antiquity knows nothing of any such female deity; and from the reference to a deity called Rimmon in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>, you cannot possibly infer the existence of a goddess Rimmonah. The explanation given by Schlottmann (Hiob, p. 132) and Paul Btticher (Rudimenta mythologiae semit. 1848, p. 10) - namely, that harmo&#772;na&#770;h as the Phoenician goddess Chusarthis, called by the Greeks &#x391;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; - is still more untenable, since &#x391;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is no more derived from the talmudic harma&#770;n than this is from the Sanscrit prama&#772;na (Btticher, l.c. p. 40); on the contrary, harma&#770;n signifies loftiness, from the Semitic root &#1492;&#1512;&#1501;, to be high, and it cannot be shown that there was a goddess called Harman or Harmonia in the Phoenician worship. Lastly, the fanciful idea of Btticher, that harmo&#772;na&#770;h is contracted from ha&#770;har rimmo&#772;na&#770;h, and that the meaning is, "and then ye throw, i.e., remove, the mountain (your Samaria) to Rimmon, that ancient place of refuge for expelled tribes" (<a href="/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45</a>.), needs no refutation.)<p>The literal meaning of harmo&#772;na&#770;h or harmo&#772;n still remains uncertain. According to the etymology of &#1492;&#1512;&#1501;, to be high, it apparently denotes a high land: at the same time, it can neither be taken as an appellative, as Hesselberg and Maurer suppose, "the high land;" nor in the sense of 'armo&#772;n, a citadel or palace, as Kimchi and Gesenius maintain. The former interpretation is open to the objection, that we cannot possibly imagine why Amos should have formed a word of his own, and one which never occurs again in the Hebrew language, to express the simple idea of a mountain or high land; and the second to this objection, that "the citadel" would require something to designate it as a citadel or fortress in the land of the enemy. The unusual word certainly points to the name of a land or district, though we have no means of determining it more precisely.<p>(Note: Even the early translators have simply rendered haharmo&#772;na&#770;h according to the most uncertain conjectures. Thus lxx, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; (al. &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;); Aq., mons Armona; Theod., mons Mona; the Quinta: excelsus mons (according to Jerome); and Theodoret attributes to Theodot. &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The Chaldee paraphrases it thus: &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, "far beyond the mountains of Armenia." Symmachus also had Armenia, according to the statement of Theodoret and Jerome. But this explanation is probably merely an inference drawn from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>, and cannot be justified, as Bochart supposes, on the ground that mo&#772;na&#770;h or mo&#772;n is identical with minn&#305;&#772;.) </body></html>
