His making use of us is an evidence of his being at peace with us. Jonah was not disobedient, as he had been. He neither endeavoured to avoid hearing the command, nor declined to obey it. See here the nature of repentance; it is the change of our mind and way, and a return to our work and duty. Also, the benefit of affliction; it brings those back to their place who had deserted it. See the power of Divine grace, for affliction of itself would rather drive men from God, than draw them to him. God's servants must go where he sends them, come when he calls them, and do what he bids them; we must do whatever the word of the Lord commands. Jonah faithfully and boldly delivered his errand. Whether Jonah said more, to show the anger of God against them, or whether he only repeated these words again and again, is not certain, but this was the purport of his message. Forty days is a long time for a righteous God to delay judgments, yet it is but a little time for an unrighteous people to repent and reform in. And should it not awaken us to get ready for death, to consider that we cannot be so sure that we shall live forty days, as Nineveh then was that it should stand forty days? We should be alarmed if we were sure not to live a month, yet we are careless though we are not sure to live a day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Jonah arose and went unto Nineveh - , ready to obey, as before to disobey. Before, when God said those same words, "he arose and fled;" now, "he arose and went." True conversion shows the same energy in serving God, as the unconverted had before shown in serving self or error. Saul's spirit of fire, which persecuted Christ, gleamed in Paul like lightning through the world, to win souls to Him.<p>Nineveh was an exceeding great city - literally "great to God," i. e., what would not only appear great to man who admires things of no account, but what, being really great, is so in the judgment of God who cannot be deceived. God did account it great, Who says to Jonah, "Should not I spare Nineveh that great city, which hath more than six score thousand that cannot discern between their right hand and their left?" It is a different idiom from that, when Scripture speaks of "the mountains of God, the cedars of God." For of these it speaks, as having their firmness or their beauty from God as their Author.<p>Of three days' journey - , i. e., 60 miles in circumference. It was a great city. Jonah speaks of its greatness, under a name which he would only have used of real greatness. Varied accounts agree in ascribing this size to Nineveh . An Eastern city enclosing often, as did Babylon, ground under tillage, the only marvel is, that such a space was enclosed by walls. Yet this too is no marvel, when we know from inscriptions, what masses of human strength the great empires of old had at their command, or of the more than threescore pyramids of Egypt . In population it was far inferior to our metropolis, of which, as of the suburbs of Rome of old , "one would hesitate to say, where the city ended, where it began. The suburban parts are so joined on to the city itself and give the spectator the idea of boundless length."<p>An Eastern would the more naturally think of the circumference of a city, because of the broad places, similar to the boulevards of Paris, which encircles it, so that people could walk around it, within it . "The buildings," it is related of Babylon, "are not brought close to the walls, but are at about the distance of an acre from them. And not even the whole city did they occupy with houses; 80 furlongs are inhabited, and not even all these continuously, I suppose because it seemed safer to live scattered in several places. The rest they sow and till, that, if any foreign force threaten them, the besieged may be supplied with food from the soil of the city itself." Not Babylon alone was spoken of, of old, as  "having the circumference of a nation rather than of a city." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. arose and went&#8212;like the son who was at first disobedient to the father's command, "Go work in my vineyard," but who afterwards "repented and went" (Mt 21:28, 29). Jonah was thus the fittest instrument for proclaiming judgment, and yet hope of mercy on repentance to Nineveh, being himself a living exemplification of both&#8212;judgment in his entombment in the fish, mercy on repentance in his deliverance. Israel professing to obey, but not obeying, and so doomed to exile in the same Nineveh, answers to the son who said, "I go, sir, and went not." In Lu 11:30 it is said that Jonas was not only a sign to the men in Christ's time, but also "unto the Ninevites." On the latter occasion (Mt 16:1-4) when the Pharisees and Sadducees tempted Him, asking a sign from heaven, He answered, "No sign shall be given, but the sign of the prophet Jonas," Mt 12:39. Thus the sign had a twofold aspect, a direct bearing on the Ninevites, an indirect bearing on the Jews in Christ's time. To the Ninevites he was not merely a prophet, but himself a wonder in the earth, as one who had tasted of death, and yet had not seen corruption, but had now returned to witness among them for God. If the Ninevites had indulged in a captious spirit, they never would have inquired and so known Jonah's wonderful history; but being humbled by God's awful message, they learned from Jonah himself that it was the previous concealing in his bosom of the same message of their own doom that caused him to be entombed as an outcast from the living. Thus he was a "sign" to them of wrath on the one hand, and, on the other, of mercy. Guilty Jonah saved from the jaws of death gives a ray of hope to guilty Nineveh. Thus God, who brings good from evil, made Jonah in his fall, punishment, and restoration, a sign (an embodied lesson or living symbol) through which the Ninevites were roused to hear and repent, as they would not have been likely to do, had he gone on the first commission before his living entombment and resurrection. To do evil that good may come, is a policy which can only come from Satan; but from evil already done to extract an instrument against the kingdom of darkness, is a triumphant display of the grace and wisdom of God. To the Pharisees in Christ's time, who, not content with the many signs exhibited by Him, still demanded a sign from heaven, He gave a sign in the opposite quarter, namely, Jonah, who came "out of the belly of hell" (the unseen region). They looked for a Messiah gloriously coming in the clouds of heaven; the Messiah, on the contrary, is to pass through a like, though a deeper, humiliation than Jonah; He is to lie "in the heart of the earth." Jonah and his Antitype alike appeared low and friendless among their hearers; both victims to death for God's wrath against sin, both preaching repentance. Repentance derives all its efficacy from the death of Christ, just as Jonah's message derived its weight with the Ninevites from his entombment. The Jews stumbled at Christ's death, the very fact which ought to have led them to Him, as Jonah's entombment attracted the Ninevites to his message. As Jonah's restoration gave hope of God's placability to Nineveh, so Christ's resurrection assures us God is fully reconciled to man by Christ's death. But Jonah's entombment only had the effect of a moral suasive; Christ's death is an efficacious instrument of reconciliation between God and man [Fairbairn].<p>Nineveh was an exceeding great city&#8212;literally, "great to God," that is, before God. All greatness was in the Hebrew mind associated with God; hence arose the idiom (compare "great mountains," Margin, "mountains of God," Ps 36:6; "goodly cedars," Margin, "cedars of God," Ps 80:10; "a mighty hunter before the Lord," Ge 10:9).<p>three days' journey&#8212;that is, about sixty miles, allowing about twenty miles for a day's journey. Jonah's statement is confirmed by heathen writers, who describe Nineveh as four hundred eighty stadia in circumference [Diodorus Siculus, 2.3]. Herodotus defines a day's journey to be one hundred fifty stadia; so three days' journey will not be much below Diodorus' estimate. The parallelogram in Central Assyria covered with remains of buildings has Khorsabad northeast; Koyunjik and Nebbi Yunus near the Tigris, northwest; Nimroud, between the Tigris and the Zab, southwest; and Karamless, at a distance inward from the Zab, southeast. From Koyunjik to Nimroud is about eighteen miles; from Khorsabad to Karamless, the same; from Koyunjik to Khorsabad, thirteen or fourteen miles; from Nimroud to Karamless, fourteen miles. The length thus was greater than the breadth; compare Jon 3:4, "a day's journey," which is confirmed by heathen writers and by modern measurements. The walls were a hundred feet high, and broad enough to allow three chariots abreast, and had moreover fifteen hundred lofty towers. The space between, including large parks and arable ground, as well as houses, was Nineveh in its full extent. The oldest palaces are at Nimroud, which was probably the original site. Layard latterly has thought that the name Nineveh belonged originally to Koyunjik, rather than to Nimroud. Jonah (Jon 4:11) mentions the children as numbering one hundred twenty thousand, which would give about a million to the whole population. Existing ruins show that Nineveh acquired its greatest extent under the kings of the second dynasty, that is, the kings mentioned in Scripture; it was then that Jonah visited it, and the reports of its magnificence were carried to the west [Layard].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jonah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">So, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">And</span>; as God commands and directs, so Jonah with ready, resolved, and obedient mind sets about the work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh; </span> though it was a long journey, yet three weeks’ or three months’ travel by land is more eligible than three days in the belly of hell. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the word of the Lord; </span> every way complying with the command of God, speeding thither resolved to preach whatsoever sermon God should put into his head, encouraged with assurance that God who did send would be with him whithersoever he was sent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">An exceeding great city; </span> the greatest city of the known world at that day; it was then in its flourishing state greater than Babylon, whose compass was three hundred and sixty-five or three hundred and eighty-five furlongs, but Nineveh was in compass four hundred and eighty, her walls a hundred feet in height, and broad enough for three coaches to meet and safely pass by each other; it had fifteen hundred towers on its walls, and these towers two hundred feet high; and one million and four hundred thousand men employed continually for eight years to build it, if our author be not mistaken. There is some difference in accounting how this city was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">three days’</span> journey: if we account the length of it at one hundred and fifty furlongs, this will amount to eighteen miles and three quarters; this seems too little to be three days’ journey, unless it be supposed the prophet accounts his leisurely progress, and takes in the many stops that would necessarily and unavoidably retard him in his walking and preaching such strange news; if we consider this, it is not unlikely six miles would be as far as he could go in a day, preaching to all and discoursing with many. Others will account it three days’ journey to go through the streets and lanes of this city; but on the supposition it was eighteen miles in length, and eleven miles in breadth, it will be more than three days’ journey, or a week’s journey; for supposing in a mile’s breadth but eight streets, from end to end, through eighteen miles’ length, it will amount to four hundred and sixty-four miles. Others account by the compass of the walls sixty miles, and allow twenty miles to each day’s journey, too far for any one to walk, preach, dispute or reason, and account for himself: the first account seems most probable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jonah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord,....

This is observed to show the greatness of the city, which was the greatest in the whole world, as well as to lead on to the following account. <p>(m)  "magna Deo", Montanus, Vatablus, Tigurine version, Mercerus, Drusius, Cocceius.

Nothing, however, can safely be determined from the use of a tense in such cases. The clause “Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city,” &c., is evidently a part of the narrative, and prepares the way for <a href="/jonah/3-4.htm" title="And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.">Jonah 3:4</a>. It simply states what Nineveh was, and what Jonah found and saw it to be, when he visited it. It is not a historical note, like that which is introduced with reference to the building of Hebron, <a href="/numbers/13-22.htm" title="And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)">Numbers 13:22</a>. St John writes (<a href="/john/5-2.htm" title="Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.">John 5:2</a>) “Now there <span class="ital">is</span> at Jerusalem by the sheep-gate a pool.” It might be argued (as it has been) that because he uses the present tense, Jerusalem must have still been standing when he wrote his Gospel. Yet it might with equal force be concluded (and it is a proof of the unsatisfactory nature of this sort of criticism) that because he says that Bethany <span class="ital">was</span> nigh unto Jerusalem (<a href="/john/9-18.htm" title="But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.">John 9:18</a>), that “Jesus went forth with His disciples over the brook Kedron, where <span class="ital">was</span> a garden” (<a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a>), and that “in the place where He was crucified there <span class="ital">was</span> a garden” (<a href="/john/19-41.htm" title="Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.">John 19:41</a>), the city and its environs were already laid waste when he wrote.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">exceeding great</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">great to God</span>. The expressions of this kind which occur in the Bible may be divided into two classes. They all alike spring out of the devout habit of the Hebrew mind, which recognises God in everything, and sees Him specially in whatever is best and greatest upon earth. But this habit of mind finds expression in two somewhat different ways. Sometimes, at the contemplation of what is more than ordinarily grand or beautiful, the pious mind rises at once to God, and recognises Him in His works. A thing so great, so fair, must be the work of His hands. “By the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the Maker of them is seen.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Who made you glorious as the gates of Heaven<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Beneath the keen full moon?…<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God! let the torrents, like a shout of nations,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Answer! and let the ice-plains echo, God!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hence such expressions as “mountains of God,” <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>; “cedars of God,” <a href="/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>; “trees of Jehovah,” <a href="/psalms/104-16.htm" title="The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;">Psalm 104:16</a>; the explanation being added in the last of these instances (comp. <a href="/numbers/24-6.htm" title="As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD has planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.">Numbers 24:6</a>), “which He hath planted.” The other class of expressions are those in which the excellence of the object contemplated appears to suggest to the mind that it will bear the scrutiny of God’s judgment, that even before Him, or as referred to Him, it is what the writer asserts it to be. To this class the expression here belongs. “Nineveh was a city, great, not only to man’s thinking, but to God’s.” (Comp. ch. <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>.) In like manner we have, “a mighty hunter before the Lord,” <a href="/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.">Genesis 10:9</a>; “fair to God,” <a href="/acts/7-20.htm" title="In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:">Acts 7:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of three days’ journey</span>] The most probable and most generally received opinion is that these words refer to the <span class="ital">circuit</span> of Nineveh, and that the writer intends by them to say that the city was so large, that it would take a man, walking at the usual pace, three days to go round it. This would give about 60 miles for its circumference. See note B.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">NOTE B. NINEVEH<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span>It is evidently the design of the writer of this Book to give prominence to the vast size of Nineveh. when he speaks of it, it is with the constant addition, “<span class="ital">the great city</span>,” (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm" title="Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.">Jonah 1:2</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-2.htm" title="Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the preaching that I bid you.">Jonah 3:2</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>), and the addition is justified by the statements that it was “great to God,” that it was a city “of three days’ journey,” and that it contained “more than sixscore thousand persons unable to discern between their right hand and their left, and also much cattle” (<a href="/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>). In seeking to verify this description and to identify, with some reasonable degree of probability, the Nineveh of Jonah, we have first to determine what is meant by the expression “a city of three days’ journey.” It has been held that the “three days’ journey” describes the time that would be occupied in traversing the city from end to end; along “the ‘high street’ representing the greatest length or ‘the diameter’ of the town, which ran from one principal gate to the opposite extremity.” (Kalisch.) But unless we are prepared to regard the “figures given in the text” as “the natural hyperboles of a writer who lived long after the virtual destruction of the city, and who, moreover, was anxious to enhance the impressiveness of his story and lesson, by dwelling on the vastness of the population whose fate depended on their moral regeneration” (Ib.), we shall find it difficult to accept the gratuitous assumption that Nineveh is here described as a city “about fifty-five English miles in diameter,” with a “high street” fifty-five miles long. Nor is it more satisfactory to suppose that by a city of three days’ journey is meant a city which it would require three days to go all over. No intelligible idea of size could possibly be conveyed by such a definition. Adopting, then, the more reasonable view that the “three days’ journey” refers to the circumference of the city, and estimating a day’s journey at about twenty miles, we have Nineveh here described as comprising a circuit of about sixty miles. Whether this large area was inclosed by continuous walls we cannot certainly say. One ancient writer, indeed, (Diodorus Siculus) asserts that it was, and that the walls were “100 feet high, and broad enough for three chariots to drive abreast upon” (<span class="ital">Dict. of Bible</span>, Article <span class="ital">Nineveh</span>); and he, moreover, gives the dimensions of the city as an irregular quadrangle of about 60 miles in circuit. But without relying too much upon his testimony, which may be regarded as doubtful, we may conclude that an area such as has been described was sufficiently marked out to be known and spoken of as the city of Nineveh. This vast area was not, however, completely covered as in the case of our own cities, with streets and squares and buildings. That was a feature unusual, and almost unknown, in the ancient cities of the East. It was perhaps the feature which, belonging to Jerusalem by virtue of the deep ravines by which it was surrounded, and which “determined its natural boundaries,” and prevented its spreading abroad after the fashion of other oriental cities, called forth the surprise and admiration of the Jews after their return from Babylon. “Jerusalem,” they exclaim, “(unlike Babylon where we so long have dwelt) is built as a city which is compact together.” Like Babylon, Nineveh included not only parks and paradises, but fields under tillage and pastures for “much cattle” (<a href="/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>) in its wide embrace. The most probable site of the city thus defined will be seen by reference to the accompanying plan. It lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris in the fork formed by that river and the Ghazr Su and Great Zab, just above their confluence. The whole of this district abounds in heaps of ruins. Indeed, “they are found,” it is said, “in vast numbers throughout the whole region watered by the Tigris and Euphrates and their confluents, from the Taurus to the Persian Gulf.” “Such mounds,” it is added, “are especially numerous in the region to the east of the Tigris, in which Nineveh stood, and some of them must mark the ruins of the Assyrian capital.” (<span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>.) Four of these great masses of ruins, which will be found marked on the plan, Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamless, Khorsabad, form together an irregular parallelogram of very similar dimensions to those mentioned in the text. From Kouyunjik (lying opposite Mosul) on the Eastern bank of the Tigris, a line drawn in a S. E. direction, parallel to the course of the river, to Nimrud is about eighteen miles. From Nimrud, in a northerly direction, to Karamless is about twelve. The opposite sides of the parallelogram, from Karamless to the most northerly point Khorsabad, and from Khorsabad to Kouyunjik again, are about the same. These four vast piles of buildings, with the area included in the parallelogram which they form, are now generally identified with the site of the Nineveh which Jonah visited. For fuller particulars the reader is referred to Smith’s <span class="ital">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, Article <span class="ital">Nineveh</span>, and to the well-known works of Mr Layard and Professor Rawlingson.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arose, and went.</span> He was now as prompt to obey as formerly to flee. <span class="cmt_word">Was</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when Jonah visited it.

So Nimrod is called (<a href="/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>) "a mighty hunter before the Lord;" and Moses, in <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>, is said to have been" beautiful to God." The expression may also mean that God (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>, God as Governor of the world) regarded this city with interest, as intended in the Divine counsels to perform an important part. For he is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of three days' journey;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in circumference - about sixty miles (see note on Jonah 1:2). Or the writer may mean that it took Jonah three days to visit the various quarters of this huge place. The area of the vast quadrangle containing the remains of the four cities comprised under the name <span class="accented">Nineveh</span> is estimated by Professor Rawlinson at two hundred and sixteen square miles. We ought, however, to omit Khorsabad from this computation, as it was not founded till Sargon's time,  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Hear this word, ye cows of Bashan, that are upon the mountain of Samaria, that oppress there the humble and crush the poor, that say to their lords, Bring hither, that we may drink. <a href="/amos/4-2.htm">Amos 4:2</a>. The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by His holiness: behold, days come upon you, that they drag you away with hooks, and your last one with fish-hooks. <a href="/amos/4-3.htm">Amos 4:3</a>. And ye will go out through breaches in the wall, every one before him, and be cast away to Harmon, is the saying of Jehovah." The commencement of this chapter is closely connected, so far as the contents are concerned, with the chapter immediately preceding. The prophet having there predicted, that when the kingdom was conquered by its enemies, the voluptuous grandees would perish, with the exception of a very few who would hardly succeed in saving their lives, turns now to the voluptuous women of Samaria, to predict in their case a shameful transportation into exile. The introduction, "Hear this word," does not point therefore to a new prophecy, but simply to a fresh stage in the prophecy, so that we cannot even agree with Ewald in taking <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1-3</a> as the conclusion of the previous prophecy (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-1.htm">Amos 3:1-15</a>). The cows of Bashan are well-fed, fat cows, &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, vaccae pingues (Symm., Jer.), as Bashan had fat pastures, and for that reason the tribes that were richest in flocks and herds had asked for it as their inheritance (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>). The fuller definitions which follow show very clearly that by the cows of Bashan, Amos meant the rich, voluptuous, and violent inhabitants of Samaria. It is doubtful, however, whether he meant the rich and wanton wives of the great, as most of the modern commentators follow Theodor., Theodoret, and others, in assuming; or "the rulers of Israel, and all the leading men of the ten tribes, who spent their time in pleasure and robbery" (Jerome); or "those rich, luxurious, and lascivious inhabitants of the palace of whom he had spoken in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9-10</a>" (Maurer), as the Chald., Luther, Calvin, and others suppose, and whom he calls cows, not oxen, to denote their effeminacy and their unbridled licentiousness. In support of the latter opinion we might adduce not only <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>, where Ephraim is compared to a young heifer, but also the circumstance that from <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a> onwards the prophecy refers to the Israelites as a whole. But neither of these arguments proves very much. The simile in <a href="/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a> applies to Ephraim as a kingdom of people, and the natural personification as a woman prepares the way for the comparison to an &#8219;egla&#770;h; whereas voluptuous and tyrannical grandees would be more likely to be compared to the bulls of Bashan (<a href="/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>). And so, again, the transition in <a href="/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a> to the Israelites as a whole furnishes no help in determining more precisely who are addressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1-3</a>. By the cows of Bashan, therefore, we understand the voluptuous women of Samaria, after the analogy of <a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9-13</a>, more especially because it is only by forcing the last clause of <a href="/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> that it can be understood as referring to men. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, because the verb stands first (compare <a href="/isaiah/32-11.htm">Isaiah 32:11</a>). The mountain of Samaria is mentioned in the place of the city built upon the mountain (see at <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>). The sin of these women consisted in the tyrannical oppression of the poor, whilst they asked their lords, i.e., their husbands, to procure them the means of debauchery. For &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; and &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, compare <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3-4</a>, where the two words are already connected. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; stands in the singular, because every wife speaks in this way to her husband.<p>The announcement of the punishment for such conduct is introduced with a solemn oath, to make an impression, if possible, upon the hardened hearts. Jehovah swears by His holiness, i.e., as the Holy One, who cannot tolerate unrighteousness. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (for) before &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; introduces the oath. Hitzig takes &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; as a niphal, as in the similar formula in <a href="/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17</a>; but he takes it as a passive used impersonally with an accusative, after <a href="/genesis/35-26.htm">Genesis 35:26</a> and other passages (though not <a href="/exodus/13-7.htm">Exodus 13:7</a>). But as &#1504;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; unquestionably occurs as a piel in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>, it is more natural to take the same form as a piel in this instance also, and whilst interpreting it impersonally, to think of the enemy as understood. Tsinno&#772;th  equals  tsinn&#305;&#772;m, <a href="/proverbs/22-5.htm">Proverbs 22:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm">Job 5:5</a>, &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;  equals  &#1510;&#1468;&#1503;, thorns, hence hooks; so also s&#305;&#772;ro&#772;th  equals  s&#305;&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, thorns, <a href="/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>. Du&#772;ga&#770;h, fishery; hence s&#305;&#772;ro&#772;th du&#772;ga&#770;h, fish-hooks. 'Acha&#774;r&#305;&#772;th does not mean posterity, or the young brood that has grown up under the instruction and example of the parents (Hitzig), but simply "the end," the opposite of re&#772;'sh&#305;&#772;th, the beginning. It is "end," however, in different senses. Here it signifies the remnant (Chaldee), i.e., those who remain and are not dragged away with tsinno&#772;th; so that the thought expressed is "all, even to the very last" (compare Hengstenberg, Christology, i. p. 368). &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1503; has a feminine suffix, whereas masculine suffixes were used before (&#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;); the universal gender, out of which the feminine was first formed. The figure is not taken from animals, into whose noses hooks and rings are inserted to tame them, or from large fishes that are let down into the water again by nose-hooks; for the technical terms applied to these hooks are &#1495;&#1495;, &#1495;&#1493;&#1495;, and &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-2</a>); but from the catching of fishes, that are drawn out of the fish-pond with hooks. Thus shall the voluptuous, wanton women be violently torn away or carried off from the midst of the superfluity and debauchery in which they lived as in their proper element. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, to go out of rents in the wall, &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; being construed, as it frequently is, with the accusative of the place; we should say, "though rents in the wall," i.e., through breaches made in the wall at the taking of the city, not out at the gates, because they had been destroyed or choked up with rubbish at the storming of the city. "Every one before her," i.e., without looking round to the right or to the left (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>, <a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>). The words &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; are difficult, on account of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, and have not yet been satisfactorily explained. The form &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is probably chosen simply for the purpose of obtaining a resemblance in sound to &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, and is sustained by &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; in <a href="/genesis/31-6.htm">Genesis 31:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; is applied to thrusting into exile, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27</a>.<p>The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; with &#1492; htiw  loc. appears to indicate the place to which they were to be carried away or cast out. But the hiphil &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; does not suit this, and consequently nearly all the earlier translators have rendered it as a passive, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;-&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5; (lxx), projiciemini (Jerome); so also the Syr. and Chald. &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, "men will carry them away captive." One Hebrew codex actually gives the hophal. And to this reading we must adhere; for the hiphil furnishes no sense at all, since the intransitive or reflective meaning, to plunge, or cast one's self, cannot be sustained, and is not supported at all by the passages quoted by Hitzig, viz., <a href="/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a> and <a href="/job/27-22.htm">Job 27:22</a>; and still less does haharmo&#772;na&#770;h denote the object cast away by the women when they go into captivity.<p>(Note: The Masoretic pointing probably originated in the idea that harmo&#772;na&#770;h, corresponding to the talmudic harma&#770;na&#770;', signifies royal power or dominion, and so Rashi interprets it: "ye will cast away the authority, i.e., the almost regal authority, or that pride and arrogance with which you bear yourselves to-day" (Ros.). This explanation would be admissible, if it were not that the use of a word which never occurs again in the old Hebrew for a thing so frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, rendered it very improbable. At any rate, it is more admissible than the different conjectures of the most recent commentators. Thus Hitzig, for example (Comm. ed. 3), would resolve haharmo&#772;na&#770;h into ha&#770;ha&#770;r and mo&#772;na&#770;h  equals  meo&#772;na&#770;h ("and ye will plunge headlong to the mountain as a place of refuge"). The objections to this are, (1) that hishl&#305;&#772;kh does not mean to plunge headlong; (2) the improbability of meo&#772;na&#770;h being contracted into mo&#772;na&#770;h, when Amos has meo&#772;na&#770;h in <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>; and lastly, the fact that meo&#772;na&#770;h means simply a dwelling, not a place of refuge. Ewald would read ha&#770;ha&#770;r rimmo&#772;na&#770;h after the lxx, and renders it, "ye will cast Rimmonah to the mountain," understanding by Rimmonah a female deity of the Syrians. But antiquity knows nothing of any such female deity; and from the reference to a deity called Rimmon in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>, you cannot possibly infer the existence of a goddess Rimmonah. The explanation given by Schlottmann (Hiob, p. 132) and Paul Btticher (Rudimenta mythologiae semit. 1848, p. 10) - namely, that harmo&#772;na&#770;h as the Phoenician goddess Chusarthis, called by the Greeks &#x391;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; - is still more untenable, since &#x391;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is no more derived from the talmudic harma&#770;n than this is from the Sanscrit prama&#772;na (Btticher, l.c. p. 40); on the contrary, harma&#770;n signifies loftiness, from the Semitic root &#1492;&#1512;&#1501;, to be high, and it cannot be shown that there was a goddess called Harman or Harmonia in the Phoenician worship. Lastly, the fanciful idea of Btticher, that harmo&#772;na&#770;h is contracted from ha&#770;har rimmo&#772;na&#770;h, and that the meaning is, "and then ye throw, i.e., remove, the mountain (your Samaria) to Rimmon, that ancient place of refuge for expelled tribes" (<a href="/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45</a>.), needs no refutation.)<p>The literal meaning of harmo&#772;na&#770;h or harmo&#772;n still remains uncertain. According to the etymology of &#1492;&#1512;&#1501;, to be high, it apparently denotes a high land: at the same time, it can neither be taken as an appellative, as Hesselberg and Maurer suppose, "the high land;" nor in the sense of 'armo&#772;n, a citadel or palace, as Kimchi and Gesenius maintain. The former interpretation is open to the objection, that we cannot possibly imagine why Amos should have formed a word of his own, and one which never occurs again in the Hebrew language, to express the simple idea of a mountain or high land; and the second to this objection, that "the citadel" would require something to designate it as a citadel or fortress in the land of the enemy. The unusual word certainly points to the name of a land or district, though we have no means of determining it more precisely.<p>(Note: Even the early translators have simply rendered haharmo&#772;na&#770;h according to the most uncertain conjectures. Thus lxx, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd; (al. &#x3a1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;); Aq., mons Armona; Theod., mons Mona; the Quinta: excelsus mons (according to Jerome); and Theodoret attributes to Theodot. &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The Chaldee paraphrases it thus: &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, "far beyond the mountains of Armenia." Symmachus also had Armenia, according to the statement of Theodoret and Jerome. But this explanation is probably merely an inference drawn from <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>, and cannot be justified, as Bochart supposes, on the ground that mo&#772;na&#770;h or mo&#772;n is identical with minn&#305;&#772;.) </body></html>
