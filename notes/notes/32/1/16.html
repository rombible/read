but it is in vain to think of saving ourselves any other way than by destroying our sins. Even natural conscience cannot but dread blood-guiltiness. And when we are led by Providence God does what he pleases, and we ought to be satisfied, though it may not please us. Throwing Jonah into the sea put an end to the storm. God will not afflict for ever, He will only contend till we submit and turn from our sins. Surely these heathen mariners will rise up in judgment against many called Christians, who neither offer prayers when in distress, nor thanksgiving for signal deliverances. The Lord commands all creatures, and can make any of them serve his designs of mercy to his people. Let us see this salvation of the Lord, and admire his power, that he could thus save a drowning man, and his pity, that he would thus save one who was running from him, and had offended him. It was of the Lord's mercies that Jonah was not consumed. Jonah was alive in the fish three days and nights: to nature this was impossible, but to the God of nature all things are possible. Jonah, by this miraculous preservation, was made a type of Christ; as our blessed Lord himself declared, Mt 12:40.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the men feared the Lord with a great fear - because, from the tranquility of the sea and the ceasing of the tempest, they saw that the prophet's words were true. This great miracle completed the conversion of the mariners. God had removed all human cause of fear; and yet, in the same words as before, he says, "they feared a great fear;" but he adds, "the Lord." It was the great fear, with which even the disciples of Jesus feared, when they saw the miracles which He did, which made even Peter say, <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>. "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." Events full of wonder had thronged upon them; things beyond nature, and contrary to nature; tidings which betokened His presence, Who had all things in His hands. They had seen "wind and storm fulfilling His word" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>, and, forerunners of the fishermen of Galilee, knowing full well from their own experience that this was above nature, they felt a great awe of God. So He commanded His people, "Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>, for thy good always" <a href="/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>.<p>And offered a sacrifice - Doubtless, as it was a large decked vessel and bound on a long voyage, they had live creatures on board, which they could offer in sacrifice. But this was not enough for their thankfulness; "they vowed vows." They promised that they would do thereafter what they could not do then ; "that they would never depart from Him whom they had begun to worship." This was true love, not to be content with aught which they could do, but to stretch forward in thought to an abiding and enlarged obedience, as God should enable them. And so they were doubtless enrolled among the people of God, firstfruits from among the pagan, won to God Who overrules all things, through the disobedience and repentance of His prophet. Perhaps, they were the first preachers among the pagan, and their account of their own wonderful deliverance prepared the way for Jonah's mission to Nineveh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. offered a sacrifice&#8212;They offered some sacrifice of thanksgiving at once, and vowed more when they should land.

What was the final effect of this, and whether they were by it thoroughly turned to God, I inquire not now; it may best become our charity, that as Jonah’s casting overboard was type of Christ’s death, so the effect it had upon the mariners might be a type of the conversion of the heathen from idols to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Exceedingly; </span> their fear before was exceeding great, but that was a fear of the danger, and for themselves a natural fear; but now they do fear the Lord and his majesty and mercy, it is a religious fear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Offered a sacrifice; </span> what they had in the ship to offer to God, or how they could offer there, appears not to us, but the Scripture affirms they did sacrifice, not to idols, but to the true God: some suppose the words are to be interpreted that they would sacrifice at Jerusalem, where they now know that the God of Jonah was worshipped. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Made vows:</span> vows are a part of natural religion, and here these persons bind themselves by vows to recognize God’s goodness in their deliverance. It is not improbable that here is a trajection, as many times in Scripture, that placed last which in construction is to be first. They vowed vows and sacrificed, i.e. vowed they would do it, would be proselytes, and ever worship him Jonah preached to them, Creator of heaven and earth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jonah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly,.... This was not a natural fear, as before, but a religious one; and not a servile fear, or a fear of punishment, but a reverential godly fear; for they feared him, not only because they saw his power in raising and stilling the tempest, but his goodness to them in saving them: <p>and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord; a spiritual sacrifice; the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving for a safe deliverance from the storm; for other sort of sacrifice they seemed not to have materials for; since they had thrown overboard what they had in the ship to lighten it, unless there might be anything left fit for this purpose; but rather, if it is to be understood of a ceremonial sacrifice, it was offered when they went out of the ship, according to the gloss of Aben Ezra; or they solemnly declared they would, as soon as they came to land; to which sense is the Targum, <p>"and they said, they would offer a sacrifice:'' <p>and agreeably to this the words may be rendered, with what follows, thus, "and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord", that is, <p>and made vows; they vowed that they would offer a sacrifice (n) when arrived in their own country, or should return to Judea, and come to Jerusalem. So the Hebrew  "vau", is often used (o), as exegetical and explanative; though many interpreters understand the vows as distinct from the sacrifice; and that they vowed that the God of the Hebrews should be their God, and that they would for the future serve and worship him only; that they would become proselytes, as Jarchi; or give alms to the poor, as Kimchi; as an evidence of their sense of gratitude to God, the author of their mercies. If these men were truly converted, as it seems as if they were, they were great gainers by this providence; for though they lost their worldly goods, they found what was infinitely better, God to be their God and portion, and all spiritual good thing a with him; and it may be observed of the wise and wonderful providence of God, that though Jonah refused to go and preach to the Gentiles at Nineveh, for which he was corrected; yet God made this dispensation a means of converting other Gentiles. <p>(n) So Drusius.

The proud self-secure sinners would not hear such prophesying as this (compare <a href="/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a>; <a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>.). Amos therefore endeavours, before making any further announcement of the judgment of God, to establish his right and duty to prophesy, by a chain-like series of similes drawn from life. V. 3. "Do two walk together without having agreed? <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>. Does the lion roar in the forest, and he has no prey? does the young lion utter his cry out of his den, without having taken anything? <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>. Does the bird fall into the trap on the ground, when there is no snare for him? does the trap rise up from the earth without making a capture? <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>. Or is the trumpet blown in the city, and the people are not alarmed? or does misfortune happen in the city, and Jehovah has not done it? <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>. For the Lord Jehovah does nothing at all, without having revealed His secret to His servants the prophets. <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>. The lion has roared; who does not fear? the Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who must not prophesy?" The contents of these verses are not to be reduced to the general thought, that a prophet could no more speak without a divine impulse than any other effect could take place without a cause. There was certainly no need for a long series of examples, such as we have in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3-6</a>, to substantiate or illustrate the thought, which a reflecting hearer would hardly have disputed, that there was a connection between cause and effect. The examples are evidently selected with the view of showing that the utterances of the prophet originate with God. This is obvious enough in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>. The first clause, "Do two men walk together, without having agreed as to their meeting?" (no&#772;&#8219;Ad, to betake one's self to a place, to meet together at an appointed place or an appointed time; compare <a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-5.htm">Joshua 11:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a>; not merely to agree together), contains something more than the trivial truth, that two persons do not take a walk together without a previous arrangement. The two who walk together are Jehovah and the prophet (Cyril); not Jehovah and the nation, to which the judgment is predicted (Cocceius, Marck, and others). Amos went as prophet to Samaria or Bethel, because the Lord had sent him thither to preach judgment to the sinful kingdom. But God would not threaten judgment if He had not a nation ripe for judgment before Him. The lion which roars when it has the prey before it is Jehovah (cf. <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>, etc.). &#1496;&#1512;&#1507; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1493; is not to be interpreted according to the second clause, as signifying "without having got possession of its prey" (Hitzig), for the lion is accustomed to roar when it has the prey before it and there is no possibility of its escape, and before it actually seizes it (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>).<p>(Note: The most terrible feature in the roaring of a lion is that with this clarigatio, or, if you prefer it, with this classicum, it declares war. And after the roar there immediately follows both slaughter and laceration. For, as a rule, it only roars with that sharp roar when it has the prey in sight, upon which it immediately springs (Bochart, Hieroz. ii. 25ff., ed. Ros.).)<p>On the contrary, the perfect la&#770;kjad in the second clause is to be interpreted according to the first clause, not as relating to the roar of satisfaction with which the lion devours the prey in its den (Baur), but as a perfect used to describe a thing which was as certain as if it had already occurred. A lion has made a capture not merely when it has actually seized the prey and torn it in pieces, but when the prey has approached so near that it cannot possibly escape. Keph&#305;&#772;r is the young lion which already goes in pursuit of prey, and is to be distinguished from the young of the lion, gu&#772;r (catulus leonis), which cannot yet go in search of prey (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2-3</a>). The two similes have the same meaning. The second strengthens the first by the assertion that God not only has before Him the nation that is ripe for judgment, but that He has it in His power.<p>The similes in <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a> do not affirm the same as those in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>, but contain the new thought, that Israel has deserved the destruction which threatens it. Pach, a snare, and mo&#772;qe&#772;sh, a trap, are frequently used synonymously; but here they are distinguished, pach denoting a bird-net, and mo&#772;qe&#772;sh a springe, a snare which holds the bird fast. The earlier translators have taken mo&#772;qe&#772;sh in the sense of yo&#772;qe&#772;sh, and understand it as referring to the bird-catcher; and Baur proposes to alter the text accordingly. But there is no necessity for this; and it is evidently unsuitable, since it is not requisite for a bird-catcher to be at hand, in order that the bird should be taken in a snare. The suffix la&#770;h refers to tsippo&#772;r, and the thought is this: in order to catch a bird in the net, a springe (gin) must be laid for it. So far as the fact itself is concerned, mo&#772;qe&#772;sh is "evidently that which is necessarily followed by falling into the net; and in this instance it is sinfulness" (Hitzig); so that the meaning of the figure would be this: "Can destruction possibly overtake you, unless your sin draws you into it?" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-35.htm">Jeremiah 2:35</a>). In the second clause pach is the subject, and &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used for the ascent or springing up of the net. Hitzig has given the meaning of the words correctly: "As the net does not spring up without catching the bird, that has sent it up by flying upon it, can ye imagine that when the destruction passes by, ye will not be seized by it, but will escape without injury?" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). Jehovah, however, causes the evil to be foretold. As the trumpet, when blown in the city, frightens the people out of their self-security, so will the voice of the prophet, who proclaims the coming evil, excite a salutary alarm in the nation (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-1.htm">Ezekiel 33:1-5</a>). For the calamity which is bursting upon the city comes from Jehovah, is sent by Him as a punishment. This thought is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, and with this explanation the whole series of figurative sentences is made perfectly clear. The approaching evil, which comes from the Lord, is predicted by the prophet, because Jehovah does not carry out His purpose without having (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, for when, except when he has, as in <a href="/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a>) first of all revealed it to the prophets, that they may warn the people to repent and to reform. So&#772;d receives a more precise definition from the first clause of the verse, or a limitation to the purposes which God is about to fulfil upon His people. And since (this is the connection of <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>) the judgment with which the Lord is drawing near fills every one with fear, and Jehovah has spoken, i.e., has made known His counsel to the prophets, they cannot but prophesy. </body></html>
