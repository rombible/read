The figure of forcing the ship through the great wave wall is very striking.

They were convinced, by the account which Jonah gave of himself, that the God whom he worshipped, <a href="/jonah/1-9.htm" title="And he said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which has made the sea and the dry land.">Jonah 1:9</a>, had brought this tempest upon them; therefore they made their petitions to him. <span class="ital">Let us not perish for this man’s life — </span>For doing that to him which in all probability will prove his destruction. <span class="ital">And lay not upon us innocent blood —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Although this man has committed nothing against us worthy of death, according to human laws, and nevertheless we are about to take away his life; yet do not impute to us the crime of shedding innocent blood, inasmuch as we take it away through extreme necessity to save our own lives, and by his own desire. <span class="ital">For thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee</span> — “Who hast raised this storm manifestly extraordinarily, who hast caused the lot to fall upon Jonah, who hast compelled him to confess himself to be guilty, and the cause of this calamity.” — Grotius. Or, as Bishop Newcome expresses their meaning, “Punish us not as murderers of an innocent man: for we judge, from the whole transaction, that we are conforming ourselves to thy will.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:13-17 The mariners rowed against wind and tide, the wind of God's displeasure, the tide of his counsel; but it is in vain to think of saving ourselves any other way than by destroying our sins. Even natural conscience cannot but dread blood-guiltiness. And when we are led by Providence God does what he pleases, and we ought to be satisfied, though it may not please us. Throwing Jonah into the sea put an end to the storm. God will not afflict for ever, He will only contend till we submit and turn from our sins. Surely these heathen mariners will rise up in judgment against many called Christians, who neither offer prayers when in distress, nor thanksgiving for signal deliverances. The Lord commands all creatures, and can make any of them serve his designs of mercy to his people. Let us see this salvation of the Lord, and admire his power, that he could thus save a drowning man, and his pity, that he would thus save one who was running from him, and had offended him. It was of the Lord's mercies that Jonah was not consumed. Jonah was alive in the fish three days and nights: to nature this was impossible, but to the God of nature all things are possible. Jonah, by this miraculous preservation, was made a type of Christ; as our blessed Lord himself declared, Mt 12:40.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The men rowed hard - , literally "dug." The word, like our "plowed the main," describes the great efforts which they made. Amid the violence of the storm, they had furled their sails. These were worse than useless. The wind was off shore, since by rowing alpine they hoped to get back to it. They put their oars well and firmly in the sea, and turned up the water, as men turn up earth by digging. But in vain! God willed it not. The sea went on its way, as before. In the description of the deluge, it is repeated <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-17.htm">Genesis 7:17-18</a>, "the waters increased and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth; the waters increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters." The waters raged and swelled, drowned the whole world, yet only bore up the ark, as a steed bears its rider: man was still, the waters obeyed. In this tempest, on the contrary, man strove, but, instead of the peace of the ark, the burden is, the violence of the tempest; "the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them" . "The prophet had pronounced sentence against himself, but they would not lay hands upon him, striving hard to get back to land, and escape the risk of bloodshed, willing to lose life rather than cause its loss. O what a change was there. The people who had served God, said, Crucify Him, Crucify Him! These are bidden to put to death; the sea rageth; the tempest commandeth; and they are careless its to their own safety, while anxious about another's." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. they could not&#8212;(Pr 21:30).

And the courageous one among the heroes will flee away naked in that day, is the saying of Jehovah." The Lord threatens as a punishment a severe oppression, which no one will be able to escape. The allusion is to the force of war, under which even the bravest and most able heroes will succumb. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511;, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, Aramaean for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, to press, construed with tachath, in the sense of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;, downwards, to press down upon a person, i.e., to press him down (Winer, Ges., Ewald). This meaning is established by &#1506;&#1511;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-4.htm">Psalm 55:4</a>, and by &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a>; so that there is no necessity to resort to the Arabic, as Hitzig does, or to alterations of the text, or to follow Baur, who gives the word the meaning, "to feel one's self pressed under another," for which there is no foundation in the language, and which does not even yield a suitable sense. The comparison instituted here to the pressure of a cart filled with sheaves, does not warrant the conclusion that Jehovah must answer to the cart; the simile is not to be carried out to this extent. The object to &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511; is wanting, but may easily be supplied from the thought, namely, the ground over which the cart is driven. The &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; attached to &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; belongs to the latitude allowed in ordinary speech, and gives to &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; the reflective meaning, which is full in itself, has quite filled itself (cf. Ewald, 315, a). In <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-14.htm">Amos 2:14-16</a> the effects of this pressure are individualized. No one will escape from it. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;, flight is lost to the swift, i.e., the swift will not find time enough to flee. The allusion to heroes and bearers of the bow shows that the pressure is caused by war. &#1511;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; belong together: "He who is light in his feet." The swift-footed will no more save his life than the rider upon a horse. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; .esroh  in <a href="/amos/2-15.htm">Amos 2:15</a> belongs to both clauses. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, the strong in his heart, i.e., the hearty, courageous. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, naked, i.e., so as to leave behind him his garment, by which the enemy seizes him, like the young man in <a href="/mark/14-52.htm">Mark 14:52</a>. This threat, which implies that the kingdom will be destroyed, is carried out still further in the prophet's following addresses. </body></html>
