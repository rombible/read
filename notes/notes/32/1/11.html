For if it be lawful, and even praise worthy for one man, though guiltless, to sacrifice his life to save the lives of many; how much more may and ought a person to do this who knows that he is the cause of imminent danger, which threatens immediate destruction to many others.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-12 Jonah gave an account of his religion, for that was his business. We may hope that he told with sorrow and shame, justifying God, condemning himself, and explaining to the mariners what a great God Jehovah is. They said to him, Why hast thou done this? If thou fearest the God that made the sea and the dry land, why wast thou such a fool as to think thou couldst flee from his presence? If the professors of religion do wrong, they will hear it from those who make no such profession. When sin has raised a storm, and laid us under the tokens of God's displeasure, we must consider what is to be done to the sin that raised the storm. Jonah uses the language of true penitents, who desire that none but themselves may fare the worse for their sins and follies. Jonah sees this to be the punishment of his iniquity, he accepts it, and justifies God in it. When conscience is awakened, and a storm raised, nothing will turn it into a calm but parting with the sin that caused the disturbance. Parting with our money will not pacify the conscience, the Jonah must be thrown overboard.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What shall we do unto thee? - They knew him to be a prophet; they ask him the mind of his God. The lots had marked out Jonah as the cause of the storm; Jonah had himself admitted it, and that the storm was for "his" cause, and came from "his" God . "Great was he who fled, greater He who required him. They dare not give him up; they cannot conceal him. They blame the fault; they confess their fear; they ask "him" the remedy, who was the author of the sin. If it was faulty to receive thee, what can we do, that God should not be angered? It is thine to direct; ours, to obey."<p>The sea wrought and was tempestuous - , literally "was going and whirling." It was not only increasingly tempestuous, but, like a thing alive and obeying its Master's will, it was holding on its course, its wild waves tossing themselves, and marching on like battalions, marshalled, arrayed for the end for which they were sent, pursuing and demanding the runaway slave of God . "It was going, as it was bidden; it was going to avenge its Lord; it was going, pursuing the fugitive prophet. It was swelling every moment, and, as though the sailors were too tardy, was rising in yet greater surges, shewing that the vengeance of the Creator admitted not of delay." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Though, both by the lot and his own confession, they knew he was the guilty person; for whose sake this storm was; yet were unwilling to do anything to him without his will and consent, his counsel and advice; perceiving that he was a prophet of the God of the Hebrews, whom he had offended, and knew the mind and will of his God, and the nature of his offence against him, and what only would appease him they desire him to tell what they ought to do; fearing that, though they had found out the man, they should make a mistake in their manner of dealing with him, and so continue the distress they were in, or increase it; their great concern being to be rid of the storm: <p>that the sea may be calm unto us? or "silent" (h)? for the waves thereof made a hideous roaring, and lifted up themselves so high, as was terrible to behold; and dashed with such vehemence against the ship, as threatened it every moment with destruction: <p>(for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous); or, "it went and swelled" (i); it was agitated to and fro, and was in a great ferment, and grew more and more stormy and tempestuous. Jonah's confession of his sin, and true repentance for it, were not sufficient; more must be one to appease an angry God; and what that was the sailors desired to know. These words are inserted in a parenthesis with us, as if put by the writer of the book, pointing out the reason of the men's request; but, according to Kimchi: they are their own words, giving a reason why they were so pressing upon him to know what they should do with him, "seeing the sea was going and stormy" (k); or more and more stormy; which seems right. <p>(h) "ut sileat", Pagninus, Vatablus, Mercerus, Drusius; "et silebit", Montanus; "ut conticeseat", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Burkius.

At the same time it was only natural and reasonable that, having learned of him the cause, they should seek to know from him the cure of their trouble. “Since you are a worshipper of the most High and Almighty God, you ought to know how the anger of your God can be appeased.”—Rosenm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">may be calm unto us</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">may be quiet from upon us</span>, <span class="ital">i. e.</span> from pressing upon us and being hostile to us.

And the flight will be lost to the swift, and the strong one will not fortify his strength, and the hero will not deliver his soul. <a href="/amos/2-15.htm">Amos 2:15</a>.

And the courageous one among the heroes will flee away naked in that day, is the saying of Jehovah." The Lord threatens as a punishment a severe oppression, which no one will be able to escape. The allusion is to the force of war, under which even the bravest and most able heroes will succumb. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511;, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, Aramaean for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, to press, construed with tachath, in the sense of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;, downwards, to press down upon a person, i.e., to press him down (Winer, Ges., Ewald). This meaning is established by &#1506;&#1511;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-4.htm">Psalm 55:4</a>, and by &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a>; so that there is no necessity to resort to the Arabic, as Hitzig does, or to alterations of the text, or to follow Baur, who gives the word the meaning, "to feel one's self pressed under another," for which there is no foundation in the language, and which does not even yield a suitable sense. The comparison instituted here to the pressure of a cart filled with sheaves, does not warrant the conclusion that Jehovah must answer to the cart; the simile is not to be carried out to this extent. The object to &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511; is wanting, but may easily be supplied from the thought, namely, the ground over which the cart is driven. The &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; attached to &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; belongs to the latitude allowed in ordinary speech, and gives to &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; the reflective meaning, which is full in itself, has quite filled itself (cf. Ewald, 315, a). In <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-14.htm">Amos 2:14-16</a> the effects of this pressure are individualized. No one will escape from it. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;, flight is lost to the swift, i.e., the swift will not find time enough to flee. The allusion to heroes and bearers of the bow shows that the pressure is caused by war. &#1511;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; belong together: "He who is light in his feet." The swift-footed will no more save his life than the rider upon a horse. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; .esroh  in <a href="/amos/2-15.htm">Amos 2:15</a> belongs to both clauses. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, the strong in his heart, i.e., the hearty, courageous. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, naked, i.e., so as to leave behind him his garment, by which the enemy seizes him, like the young man in <a href="/mark/14-52.htm">Mark 14:52</a>. This threat, which implies that the kingdom will be destroyed, is carried out still further in the prophet's following addresses. </body></html>
