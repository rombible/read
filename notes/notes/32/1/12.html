We may hope that he told with sorrow and shame, justifying God, condemning himself, and explaining to the mariners what a great God Jehovah is. They said to him, Why hast thou done this? If thou fearest the God that made the sea and the dry land, why wast thou such a fool as to think thou couldst flee from his presence? If the professors of religion do wrong, they will hear it from those who make no such profession. When sin has raised a storm, and laid us under the tokens of God's displeasure, we must consider what is to be done to the sin that raised the storm. Jonah uses the language of true penitents, who desire that none but themselves may fare the worse for their sins and follies. Jonah sees this to be the punishment of his iniquity, he accepts it, and justifies God in it. When conscience is awakened, and a storm raised, nothing will turn it into a calm but parting with the sin that caused the disturbance. Parting with our money will not pacify the conscience, the Jonah must be thrown overboard.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take me up, and cast me into the sea - Neither might Jonah have said this, nor might the sailors have obeyed it, without the command of God. Jonah might will alone to perish, who had alone offended; but, without the command of God, the Giver of life, neither Jonah nor the sailors might dispose of the life of Jonah. But God willed that Jonah should be cast into the sea - where he had gone for refuge - that (Wisdom 11:16) wherewithal he had "sinned, by the same also he might be punished" as a man; and, as a prophet, that he might, in his three days' burial, prefigure Him who, after His Resurrection, should convert, not Nineveh, but the world, the cry of whose wickedness went up to God.<p>For I know that for my sake - o "In that he says, "I know," he marks that he had a revelation; in that he says, "this great storm," he marks the need which lay on those who cast him into the sea." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. cast me &#8230; into the sea&#8212;Herein Jonah is a type of Messiah, the one man who offered Himself to die, in order to allay the stormy flood of God's wrath (compare Ps 69:1, 2, as to Messiah), which otherwise must have engulfed all other men. So Caiaphas by the Spirit declared it expedient that one man should die, and that the whole nation should not perish (Joh 11:50). Jonah also herein is a specimen of true repentance, which leads the penitent to "accept the punishment of his iniquity" (Le 26:41, 43), and to be more indignant at his sin than at his suffering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jonah/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He said unto them; </span> he readily gives them advice for their safety. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Take me up:</span> this he spake as a prophet directed of God, and not, as some Jewish rabbi thinks, choosing to die rather than to go to Nineveh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cast me forth into the sea; </span> throw me overboard into the sea; no other way must you deal with me than this, and this way I not only direct as expedient, but from God I give you it as a command, and you must do it; thus my God will punish my disobedience and contempt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So shall the sea be calm unto you; </span> as a prophet I assure you the tempest shall cease, and you be safe, and by that you may know I being in the ship endangered you all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I know; </span> I am assured of this, and though I have been your danger, and this was my fault, yet it shall not be my fault if you be drowned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For my sake; </span> for my sin, which God will punish, but not by my own act, I must not leap overboard; it is a crime God will punish by that justice which is in this place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">This great tempest is upon you; </span> and will be, till you have executed God’s sentence on me, which I willingly submit to. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jonah/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them, take me up, and cast me forth into the sea,.... This he said not as choosing rather to die than to go to Nineveh; or as having overheard the men say that they would cast him into the sea, as Aben Ezra suggests, greatly to the prejudice of the prophet's character; but as being truly sensible of his sin, and that he righteously deserved to die such a death; and in love to the lives of innocent men, that they might be saved, and not perish, through his default; and as a prophet, knowing this to be the mind and will of God, he cheerfully and in faith submits to it, with a presence of mind and courage suitable to his character. It was not fit he should leap into the sea and destroy himself; but that he should die by the hand of justice, of which the shipmaster and the ship's crew were the proper executioners: <p>so shall the sea be calm unto you; or "silent", as before; it will cease from its roaring, and do no further hurt and damage: <p>for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you; for the sin he had committed in fleeing from God, this storm was raised and continued; nor could it go off till they had done what he had directed them to; there was no other way of being clear of it. In this Jonah was a type of Christ, who willingly gave himself to suffer and die, that he might appease divine wrath, satisfy justice, and save men; only with this difference, Jonah suffered for his own sins, Christ for the sins of others; Jonah to endured a storm he himself had raised by his sins, Christ to endure a storm others had raised by their sins. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jonah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jonah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">cast me forth into the sea</span>] “The question is raised whether Jonah ought of his own accord to have offered himself to death; for his doing so seems to be a sign of despair. He might, indeed, have surrendered himself to their will, but here he, as it were, incites them to the deed. <span class="ital">Cast me into the sea</span>, he says, for in no other way will you appease God, than by punishing me. He seems like a man in despair when he thus goes at his own instance to death. But without doubt Jonah recognised that he was divinely summoned to punishment. It is uncertain whether he then conceived a hope of preservation, whether, that is, with a present confidence, he rested on the grace of God; but, however that be, one may gather that he goes forth to death because he perceives and is assuredly persuaded that he is in a manner summoned by the clear voice of God. And so there is no doubt that he patiently undergoes the judgment which the Lord has brought against him.”—Calvin.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Jonah, brought to a better mind, perhaps divinely inspired, pronounces his own sentence. "I know," he says, "that the fault is mine, and deserves death, therefore take me up, and cast me forth into the sea." He will not he his own executioner, but will patiently bear a death righteously inflicted by others, whoso safety he was endangering by his continued presence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This base contempt of their covenant mercies the Lord would visit with a severe punishment. <a href="/amos/2-13.htm">Amos 2:13</a>. "Behold, I will press you down, as the cart presses that is filled with sheaves. <a href="/amos/2-14.htm">Amos 2:14</a>. And the flight will be lost to the swift, and the strong one will not fortify his strength, and the hero will not deliver his soul. <a href="/amos/2-15.htm">Amos 2:15</a>. And the carrier of the bow will not stand, and the swift-footed will not deliver, and the rider of the horse will not save his soul. <a href="/amos/2-16.htm">Amos 2:16</a>. And the courageous one among the heroes will flee away naked in that day, is the saying of Jehovah." The Lord threatens as a punishment a severe oppression, which no one will be able to escape. The allusion is to the force of war, under which even the bravest and most able heroes will succumb. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511;, from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, Aramaean for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, to press, construed with tachath, in the sense of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;, downwards, to press down upon a person, i.e., to press him down (Winer, Ges., Ewald). This meaning is established by &#1506;&#1511;&#1492; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/55-4.htm">Psalm 55:4</a>, and by &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492; in <a href="/psalms/66-11.htm">Psalm 66:11</a>; so that there is no necessity to resort to the Arabic, as Hitzig does, or to alterations of the text, or to follow Baur, who gives the word the meaning, "to feel one's self pressed under another," for which there is no foundation in the language, and which does not even yield a suitable sense. The comparison instituted here to the pressure of a cart filled with sheaves, does not warrant the conclusion that Jehovah must answer to the cart; the simile is not to be carried out to this extent. The object to &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511; is wanting, but may easily be supplied from the thought, namely, the ground over which the cart is driven. The &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; attached to &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; belongs to the latitude allowed in ordinary speech, and gives to &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; the reflective meaning, which is full in itself, has quite filled itself (cf. Ewald, 315, a). In <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-14.htm">Amos 2:14-16</a> the effects of this pressure are individualized. No one will escape from it. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1505;, flight is lost to the swift, i.e., the swift will not find time enough to flee. The allusion to heroes and bearers of the bow shows that the pressure is caused by war. &#1511;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; belong together: "He who is light in his feet." The swift-footed will no more save his life than the rider upon a horse. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; .esroh  in <a href="/amos/2-15.htm">Amos 2:15</a> belongs to both clauses. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, the strong in his heart, i.e., the hearty, courageous. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, naked, i.e., so as to leave behind him his garment, by which the enemy seizes him, like the young man in <a href="/mark/14-52.htm">Mark 14:52</a>. This threat, which implies that the kingdom will be destroyed, is carried out still further in the prophet's following addresses. </body></html>
