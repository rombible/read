Sin brings storms and tempests into the soul, into the family, into churches and nations; it is a disquieting, disturbing thing. Having called upon their gods for help, the sailors did what they could to help themselves. Oh that men would be thus wise for their souls, and would be willing to part with that wealth, pleasure, and honour, which they cannot keep without making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, and ruining their souls for ever! Jonah was fast asleep. Sin is stupifying, and we are to take heed lest at any time our hearts are hardened by the deceitfulness of it. What do men mean by sleeping on in sin, when the word of God and the convictions of their own consciences, warn them to arise and call on the Lord, if they would escape everlasting misery? Should not we warn each other to awake, to arise, to call upon our God, if so be he will deliver us? The sailors concluded the storm was a messenger of Divine justice sent to some one in that ship. Whatever evil is upon us at any time, there is a cause for it; and each must pray, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. The lot fell upon Jonah. God has many ways of bringing to light hidden sins and sinners, and making manifest that folly which was thought to be hid from the eyes of all living.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But (And) the Lord sent out - (literally 'cast along'). Jonah had done his all. Now God's part began. This He expresses by the word, "And." Jonah took "his" measures, "and" now God takes "His." He had let him have his way, as He often deals with those who rebel against Him. He lets them have their way up to a certain point. He waits, in the tranquility of His Almightiness, until they have completed their preparations; and then, when man has ended, He begins, that man may see the more that it is His doing . "He takes those who flee from Him in their flight, the wise in their counsels, sinners in their conceits and sins, and draws them back to Himself and compels them to return. Jonah thought to find rest in the sea, and lo! a tempest." Probably, God summoned back Jonah, as soon as he had completed all on his part, and sent the tempest, soon after he left the shore.<p>At least, such tempests often swept along that shore, and were known by their own special name, like the Euroclydon off Crete. Jonah too alone had gone down below deck to sleep, and, when the storm came, the mariners thought it possible to put back. Josephus says of that shore,  "Joppa having by nature no haven, for it ends in a rough shore, mostly abrupt, but for a short space having projections, i. e., deep rocks and cliffs advancing into the sea, inclining on either side toward each other (where the traces of the chains of Andromeda yet shown accredit the antiquity of the fable,) and the north wind beating right on the shore, and dashing the high waves against the rocks which receive them, makes the station there a harborless sea. As those from Joppa were tossing here, a strong wind (called by those who sail here, the black north wind) falls upon them at daybreak, dashing straightway some of the ships against each other, some against the rocks, and some, forcing their way against the waves to the open sea, (for they fear the rocky shore ...) the breakers towering above them, sank."<p>The ship was like - (literally 'thought') To be broken Perhaps Jonah means by this very vivid image to exhibit the more his own dullness. He ascribes, as it were, to the ship a sense of its own danger, as she heaved and rolled and creaked and quivered under the weight of the storm which lay on her, and her masts groaned, and her yard-arms shivered. To the awakened conscience everything seems to have been alive to God's displeasure, except itself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. sent out&#8212;literally, caused a wind to burst forth.

Winds are at the command of God, which he raises at his pleasure, and fulfil his will, and are servants of his that obey his orders: this here was sent in pursuit of Jonah, to stop him in his voyage, when he thought he had got clear off, and was safe enough. The Jews say (y) this was done when he had been one day's voyage: <p>and there was a great tempest in the sea; which caused the waves to rise and roar, and become very tumultuous: this wind was an extraordinary one, like that "laelaps" or storm of wind which came down into the sea when the disciples of Christ were on it in a ship; or like the "Euroclydon", in which the Apostle Paul was, <a href="/acts/27-14.htm">Acts 27:14</a>; <p>so that the ship was like to be broken; it was in danger of it; it seemed as if it would, the waves of the sea were so strong, and beat so hard upon it.

At the same time, he gives a fuller description of the sins of Israel, condemning first of all the prevailing crimes of injustice and oppression, of shameless immorality and daring contempt of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-8</a>); and secondly, its scornful contempt of the benefits conferred by the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9-12</a>), and threatening inevitable trouble in consequence (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-13.htm">Amos 2:13-16</a>). <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>. "Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I shall not reverse it, because they sell the righteous for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes. <a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>. They who pant after dust of the earth upon the head of the poor, and bend the way of the meek: and a man and his father go to the same girl, to desecrate my holy name. <a href="/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>. And they stretch themselves upon pawned clothes by every altar, and they drink the wine of the punished in the house of their God." The prophet condemns four kinds of crimes. The first is unjust treatment, or condemnation of the innocent in their administration of justice. Selling the righteous for silver, i.e., for money, refers to the judges, who were bribed to punish a man as guilty of the crime of which he was accused, when he was really tsadd&#305;&#772;q, i.e., righteous in a judicial, not in a moral sense, or innocent of any punishable crime. Bakkeseph, for money, i.e., either to obtain money, or for the money which they had already received, viz., from the accuser, for condemning the innocent. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, on account of, is not synonymous with &#1489; pretii; for they did not sell the poor man merely to get a pair of sandals for him, as the worst possible slave was certainly worth much more than this (cf. <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>); but the poor debtor who could not pay for a pair of shoes, i.e., for the merest trifle, the judge would give up to the creditor for a salve, on the strength of the law in <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a> (cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>).<p>As a second crime, Amos reproves in v. 7a their thirst for the oppression of the quiet in the land. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, and &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;. The address is carried on in participles, in the form of lively appeal, instead of quiet description, as is frequently the case in Amos (cf. <a href="/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>; <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>., 13, <a href="/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>), and also in other books (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>). In the present instance, the article before the participle points back to the suffix in &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501;, and the finite verb is not introduced till the second clause. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, to gasp, to pant, to long eagerly for earth-dust upon the head of the poor, i.e., to long to see the head of the poor covered with earth or dust, or to bring them into such a state of misery, that they scatter dust upon their head (cf. <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>). The explanation given by Hitzig is too far-fetched and unnatural, viz., that they grudge the man in distress even the handful of dust that he has strewn upon his head, and avariciously long for it themselves. To bend the way of the meek, i.e., to bring them into a trap, or cast them headlong into destruction by impediments and stumblingblocks laid in their path. The way is the way of life, their outward course. The idea that the way refers to the judgment or legal process is too contracted. The third crime is their profanation of the name of God by shameless immorality (<a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>); and the fourth, desecration of the sanctuary by drinking carousals (<a href="/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>). A man and his father, i.e., both son and father, go to the girl, i.e., to the prostitute. The meaning is, to one and the same girl; but 'achath is omitted, to preclude all possible misunderstanding, as though going to different prostitutes was allowed. This sin was tantamount to incest, which, according to the law, was to be punished with death (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-15.htm">Leviticus 18:15</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>). Temple girls (qede&#772;sho&#772;th) are not to be thought of here. The profanation of the name of God by such conduct as this does not indicate prostitution in the temple itself, such as was required by the licentious worship of Baal and Asherah (Ewald, Maurer, etc.), but consisted in a daring contempt of the commandments of God, as the original passage (<a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>) from which Amos took the words clearly shows (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/34-16.htm">Jeremiah 34:16</a>). By lema&#8219;an, in order that (not "so that"), the profanation of the holy name of God is represented as intentional, to bring out the daring character of the sin, and to show that it did not arise from weakness or ignorance, but was practised with studious contempt of the holy God. Bega&#770;d&#305;&#772;m cha&#774;bhul&#305;&#772;m, pawned clothes, i.e., upper garments, consisting of a large square piece of cloth, which was wrapt all around, and served the poor for a counterpane as well. If a poor man was obliged to pawn his upper garment, it was to be returned to him before night came on (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>), and a garment so pawned was not to be slept upon (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12-13</a>). But godless usurers kept such pledges, and used them as cloths upon which they stretched their limbs at feasts (yattu&#772;, hiphil, to stretch out, sc. the body or its limbs); and this they did by every altar, at sacrificial meals, without standing in awe of God. It is very evident that Amos is speaking of sacrificial feasting, from the reference in the second clause of the verse to the drinking of wine in the house of God. &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, punished in money, i.e., fined. Wine of the punished is wine purchased by the produce of the fines. Here again the emphasis rests upon the fact, that such drinking carousals were held in the house of God. 'Elo&#772;he&#772;hem, not their gods (idols), but their God; for Amos had in his mind the sacred places at Bethel and Dan, in which the Israelites worshipped Jehovah as their God under the symbol of an ox (calf). The expression col-mizbe&#772;a&#774;ch (every altar) is not at variance with this; for even if col pointed to a plurality of altars, these altars were still ba&#772;mo&#772;th, dedicated to Jehovah. If the prophet had also meant to condemn actual idolatry, i.e., the worship of heathen deities, he would have expressed this more clearly; to say nothing of the fact, that in the time of Jeroboam II there was no heathenish idolatry in the kingdom of the ten tribes, or, at any rate, it was not publicly maintained. </body></html>
