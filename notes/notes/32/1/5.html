Besides, when a resolution is once irrevocably (as we think) taken, conscience ceases to disturb with its wakeful warning, and the restlessness of remorse has not yet arrived.

Sin brings storms and tempests into the soul, into the family, into churches and nations; it is a disquieting, disturbing thing. Having called upon their gods for help, the sailors did what they could to help themselves. Oh that men would be thus wise for their souls, and would be willing to part with that wealth, pleasure, and honour, which they cannot keep without making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, and ruining their souls for ever! Jonah was fast asleep. Sin is stupifying, and we are to take heed lest at any time our hearts are hardened by the deceitfulness of it. What do men mean by sleeping on in sin, when the word of God and the convictions of their own consciences, warn them to arise and call on the Lord, if they would escape everlasting misery? Should not we warn each other to awake, to arise, to call upon our God, if so be he will deliver us? The sailors concluded the storm was a messenger of Divine justice sent to some one in that ship. Whatever evil is upon us at any time, there is a cause for it; and each must pray, Lord, show me wherefore thou contendest with me. The lot fell upon Jonah. God has many ways of bringing to light hidden sins and sinners, and making manifest that folly which was thought to be hid from the eyes of all living.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And cried, every man unto his God - They did what they could.  "Not knowing the truth, they yet know of a Providence, and, amid religious error, know that there is an Object of reverence." In ignorance they had received one who offended God. And now God, "whom they ignorantly worshiped" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, while they cried to the gods, who, they thought, disposed of them, heard them. They escaped with the loss of their wares, but God saved their lives and revealed Himself to them. God hears ignorant prayer, when ignorance is not willful and sin.<p>To lighten it of them - , literally "to lighten from against them, to lighten" what was so much "against them," what so oppressed them.  "They thought that the ship was weighed down by its wonted lading, and they knew not that the whole weight was that of the fugitive prophet."  "The sailors cast forth their wares," but the ship was not lightened. For the whole weight still remained, the body of the prophet, that heavy burden, not from the nature of the body, but from the burden of sin. For nothing is so onerous and heavy as sin and disobedience. Whence also Zechariah Zechariah 5:7 represented it under the image of lead. And David, describing its nature, said <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>, "my wickednesses are gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me." And Christ cried aloud to those who lived in many sins, <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>. "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will refresh you."<p>Jonah was gone down - , probably before the beginning of the storm, not simply before the lightening of the vessel. He could hardly have fallen asleep "then." A pagan ship was a strange place for a prophet of God, not as a prophet, but as a fugitive; and so, probably, ashamed of what he had completed, he had withdrawn from sight and notice. He did not embolden himself in his sin, but shrank into himself. The conscience most commonly awakes, when the sin is done. It stands aghast as itself; but Satan, if he can, cuts off its retreat. Jonah had no retreat now, unless God had made one.<p>And was fast asleep - The journey to Joppa had been long and hurried; he had "fled." Sorrow and remorse completed what fatigue began. Perhaps he had given himself up to sleep, to dull his conscience. For it is said, "he lay down and was fast asleep." Grief produces sleep; from where it is said of the apostles in the night before the Lord's Passion, when Jesus "rose up from prayer and was come to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow" <a href="/luke/22-45.htm">Luke 22:45</a> . "Jonah slept heavily. Deep was the sleep, but it was not of pleasure but of grief; not of heartlessness, but of heavy-heartedness. For well-disposed servants soon feel their sins, as did he. For when the sin has been done, then he knows its frightfulness. For such is sin. When born, it awakens pangs in the soul which bare it, contrary to the law of our nature. For so soon as we are born, we end the travail-pangs; but sin, so soon as born, rends with pangs the thoughts which conceived it." Jonah was in a deep sleep, a sleep by which he was fast held and bound;  a sleep as deep as that from which Sisera never woke.  Had God allowed the ship to sink, the memory of Jonah would have been that of the fugitive prophet. As it is, his deep sleep stands as an image of the lethargy of sin . "This most deep sleep of Jonah signifies a man torpid and slumbering in error, to whom it sufficed not to flee from the face of God, but his mind, drowned in a stupor and not knowing the displeasure of God, lies asleep, steeped in security." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. mariners were afraid&#8212;though used to storms; the danger therefore must have been extreme.<p>cried every man unto his god&#8212;The idols proved unable to save them, though each, according to Phœnician custom, called on his tutelary god.

How different was Jesus' sleep on the Sea of Galilee! (Mr 4:37-39). Guilty Jonah's indifference to fear contrasts with the unoffending mariners' alarm. The original therefore is in the nominative absolute: "But as for Jonah, he," &c.

Perceiving that the storm was not an ordinary, but a supernatural one; and that the ship and all in it were in extreme danger, and no probability of being saved. This shows that the storm must be very violent, to frighten such men who were used to the sea, and to storms, and were naturally bold and intrepid. The word used signifies "salters", so called from the salt sea they used, as they are by us "mariners", from "mare", the "sea"; though R. Japhet in Aben Ezra thinks the commodity they carried in their vessel was salt: <p>and cried every man to his god: to help them, and save them out of their distress. In the ship it seems were men of different nations, and who worshipped different gods. It was a notion of the Jews, and which Jarchi mentions as his own, that there were men of the seventy nations of the earth in it; and as each of them had a different god, they separately called upon them. The polytheism of the Pagans is to be condemned, and shows the great uncertainty of their religion; yet this appears to be agreeable to the light of nature that there is a God, and that God is to be prayed unto, and called upon, especially in time of trouble: <p>and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them; or, "the vessels" (c), a word the Hebrews use for all sorts of goods, utensils, &amp;c. it includes, with others, their military weapons they had to defend themselves, their provisions, the ship's stores or goods it was freighted with; finding their prayers to their gods were ineffectual, they betook themselves to this prudential method to lighten the ship, that they might be able to keep its head above water. So the Targum, <p>"when they saw there was no profit in them;'' <p>that is in the gods they called upon, then they did this; the other was a matter of religion this a point of prudence; such a step the mariners took that belonged to the ship in which the Apostle Paul was, <a href="/acts/27-18.htm">Acts 27:18</a>; <p>but Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; into one of its sides, into a cabin there; the lowest side, as the Targum: <p>and he lay, and was fast asleep; even snored, as some versions have it: it may seem strange he should when the wind was so strong and boisterous; the sea roaring; the waves beating; the ship rolling about; the mariners hurrying from place to place, and calling to each other to do their duty; and the passengers crying; and, above all, that he should fall into so sound a sleep, and continue in it, when he had such a guilty conscience. This shows that he was asleep in a spiritual as well as in a corporeal sense. <p>(c)  "vasa", V. L.

It may only mean the furniture of the ship, moveables, spare tackling, etc. In St Paul’s shipwreck a similar course was taken (<a href="/acts/27-19.htm" title="And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.">Acts 27:19</a>), but the cargo was not thrown overboard till a later period (<a href="/acts/27-38.htm" title="And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.">Acts 27:38</a>). Jonah’s ship may have been, like St Paul’s, a corn ship. The export of corn from Joppa was very considerable. See <a href="/1_kings/5-9.htm" title="My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.">1 Kings 5:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm" title="Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants: they traded in your market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.">Ezekiel 27:17</a>; <a href="/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to lighten it of them</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">to lighten</span> (the burden) <span class="bld">from upon them</span> (the mariners), i. e. to make matters easier for them. Comp. <a href="/exodus/18-22.htm" title="And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.">Exodus 18:22</a>, where the same Hebrew phrase is rendered “it shall be easier for thyself.” <span class="ital">Unto them</span>, R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the sides of the ship</span>] The Hebrew word is not the same as that rendered “ship” earlier in the verse. It occurs nowhere else in the O.T., but the verb from which it is derived signifies to ‘<span class="ital">cover</span>’ or ‘<span class="ital">board over</span>’ (<a href="/1_kings/7-3.htm" title="And it was covered with cedar above on the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.">1 Kings 7:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-7.htm" title="Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.">1 Kings 7:7</a>), so that it is probably used to denote that it was a <span class="ital">decked</span> vessel in which Jonah sailed, and that he had, as we should say, gone down below. The “sides of the ship” are what we should call the bottom of the ship, the part in which the two sides meet. The same expression is used of the innermost recess of a cave, the point of meeting of the two sides (<a href="/1_samuel/24-3.htm" title="And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.">1 Samuel 24:3</a>). <span class="ital">Innermost parts</span>, R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">was fast asleep</span>] Jonah had probably fallen asleep before the storm commenced, and slumbered too deeply to be roused by it, or by the commotion on board. Our Lord’s sleep amidst the storm on the lake (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm" title="And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, care you not that we perish?">Mark 4:38</a>) furnishes at once a comparison and a contrast. Kalisch quotes in illustration of the heavy sleep of sorrow the case of the disciples in the Garden; “He found them sleeping for sorrow,” <a href="/luke/22-45.htm" title="And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,">Luke 22:45</a>; and the words of Sallust, “primo cura, dein, uti ægrum animum solet, somnus cepit,” <span class="ital">Bell. Jug.</span> c.71.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">5, 6</span>. The conduct of the heathen mariners stands in striking and favourable contrast with that of the Jewish prophet. They call upon their gods and use every effort to save the ship. He, moody, miserable, and weary with mental conflict and bodily fatigue, is sunk in deep sleep, and has to be roused to consciousness and prayer by the reproaches of the heathen captain.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mariners</span> (<span class="accented">mallachim</span>).

The Hebrew word for "ship" (<span class="accented">sephinah</span>) is found nowhere else, and, probably from its derivation (<span class="accented">saphan</span>, "to cover"), implies that the vessel was decked. <span class="cmt_word">He lay, and was fast asleep;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>, "was asleep and snoring," (Septuagint); <span class="accented">dormiebat sopore gravi</span> (Vulgate). The word used implies a very deep sleep, as that of Sisera (<a href="/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>) or of the Assyrians (<a href="/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>). He was fatigued and worn out with mental anxiety, and now being, as he thought, secure, and longing for solitude, he lay down to sleep, unconscious of danger. Contrast this sleep in the storm with that of Christ (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>), and that of the apostles who slept for sorrow (<a href="/luke/22-45.htm">Luke 22:45</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this introduction, the prophet's address turns to Israel of the ten tribes, and in precisely the same form as in the case of the nations already mentioned, announces the judgment as irrevocable. At the same time, he gives a fuller description of the sins of Israel, condemning first of all the prevailing crimes of injustice and oppression, of shameless immorality and daring contempt of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-8</a>); and secondly, its scornful contempt of the benefits conferred by the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9-12</a>), and threatening inevitable trouble in consequence (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/2-13.htm">Amos 2:13-16</a>). <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>. "Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I shall not reverse it, because they sell the righteous for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes. <a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>. They who pant after dust of the earth upon the head of the poor, and bend the way of the meek: and a man and his father go to the same girl, to desecrate my holy name. <a href="/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>. And they stretch themselves upon pawned clothes by every altar, and they drink the wine of the punished in the house of their God." The prophet condemns four kinds of crimes. The first is unjust treatment, or condemnation of the innocent in their administration of justice. Selling the righteous for silver, i.e., for money, refers to the judges, who were bribed to punish a man as guilty of the crime of which he was accused, when he was really tsadd&#305;&#772;q, i.e., righteous in a judicial, not in a moral sense, or innocent of any punishable crime. Bakkeseph, for money, i.e., either to obtain money, or for the money which they had already received, viz., from the accuser, for condemning the innocent. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, on account of, is not synonymous with &#1489; pretii; for they did not sell the poor man merely to get a pair of sandals for him, as the worst possible slave was certainly worth much more than this (cf. <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>); but the poor debtor who could not pay for a pair of shoes, i.e., for the merest trifle, the judge would give up to the creditor for a salve, on the strength of the law in <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a> (cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>).<p>As a second crime, Amos reproves in v. 7a their thirst for the oppression of the quiet in the land. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;, and &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;. The address is carried on in participles, in the form of lively appeal, instead of quiet description, as is frequently the case in Amos (cf. <a href="/amos/5-7.htm">Amos 5:7</a>; <a href="/amos/6-3.htm">Amos 6:3</a>., 13, <a href="/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>), and also in other books (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>). In the present instance, the article before the participle points back to the suffix in &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501;, and the finite verb is not introduced till the second clause. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, to gasp, to pant, to long eagerly for earth-dust upon the head of the poor, i.e., to long to see the head of the poor covered with earth or dust, or to bring them into such a state of misery, that they scatter dust upon their head (cf. <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>). The explanation given by Hitzig is too far-fetched and unnatural, viz., that they grudge the man in distress even the handful of dust that he has strewn upon his head, and avariciously long for it themselves. To bend the way of the meek, i.e., to bring them into a trap, or cast them headlong into destruction by impediments and stumblingblocks laid in their path. The way is the way of life, their outward course. The idea that the way refers to the judgment or legal process is too contracted. The third crime is their profanation of the name of God by shameless immorality (<a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>); and the fourth, desecration of the sanctuary by drinking carousals (<a href="/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>). A man and his father, i.e., both son and father, go to the girl, i.e., to the prostitute. The meaning is, to one and the same girl; but 'achath is omitted, to preclude all possible misunderstanding, as though going to different prostitutes was allowed. This sin was tantamount to incest, which, according to the law, was to be punished with death (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-15.htm">Leviticus 18:15</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>). Temple girls (qede&#772;sho&#772;th) are not to be thought of here. The profanation of the name of God by such conduct as this does not indicate prostitution in the temple itself, such as was required by the licentious worship of Baal and Asherah (Ewald, Maurer, etc.), but consisted in a daring contempt of the commandments of God, as the original passage (<a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>) from which Amos took the words clearly shows (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/34-16.htm">Jeremiah 34:16</a>). By lema&#8219;an, in order that (not "so that"), the profanation of the holy name of God is represented as intentional, to bring out the daring character of the sin, and to show that it did not arise from weakness or ignorance, but was practised with studious contempt of the holy God. Bega&#770;d&#305;&#772;m cha&#774;bhul&#305;&#772;m, pawned clothes, i.e., upper garments, consisting of a large square piece of cloth, which was wrapt all around, and served the poor for a counterpane as well. If a poor man was obliged to pawn his upper garment, it was to be returned to him before night came on (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>), and a garment so pawned was not to be slept upon (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12-13</a>). But godless usurers kept such pledges, and used them as cloths upon which they stretched their limbs at feasts (yattu&#772;, hiphil, to stretch out, sc. the body or its limbs); and this they did by every altar, at sacrificial meals, without standing in awe of God. It is very evident that Amos is speaking of sacrificial feasting, from the reference in the second clause of the verse to the drinking of wine in the house of God. &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, punished in money, i.e., fined. Wine of the punished is wine purchased by the produce of the fines. Here again the emphasis rests upon the fact, that such drinking carousals were held in the house of God. 'Elo&#772;he&#772;hem, not their gods (idols), but their God; for Amos had in his mind the sacred places at Bethel and Dan, in which the Israelites worshipped Jehovah as their God under the symbol of an ox (calf). The expression col-mizbe&#772;a&#774;ch (every altar) is not at variance with this; for even if col pointed to a plurality of altars, these altars were still ba&#772;mo&#772;th, dedicated to Jehovah. If the prophet had also meant to condemn actual idolatry, i.e., the worship of heathen deities, he would have expressed this more clearly; to say nothing of the fact, that in the time of Jeroboam II there was no heathenish idolatry in the kingdom of the ten tribes, or, at any rate, it was not publicly maintained. </body></html>
