Even natural conscience cannot but dread blood-guiltiness. And when we are led by Providence God does what he pleases, and we ought to be satisfied, though it may not please us. Throwing Jonah into the sea put an end to the storm. God will not afflict for ever, He will only contend till we submit and turn from our sins. Surely these heathen mariners will rise up in judgment against many called Christians, who neither offer prayers when in distress, nor thanksgiving for signal deliverances. The Lord commands all creatures, and can make any of them serve his designs of mercy to his people. Let us see this salvation of the Lord, and admire his power, that he could thus save a drowning man, and his pity, that he would thus save one who was running from him, and had offended him. It was of the Lord's mercies that Jonah was not consumed. Jonah was alive in the fish three days and nights: to nature this was impossible, but to the God of nature all things are possible. Jonah, by this miraculous preservation, was made a type of Christ; as our blessed Lord himself declared, Mt 12:40.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They took up Jonah - o "He does not say, 'laid hold on him', nor 'came upon him' but 'lifted' him; as it were, bearing him with respect and honor, they cast him into the sea, not resisting, but yielding himself to their will."<p>The sea ceased (literally "stood") from his raging - Ordinarily, the waves still swell, when the wind has ceased. The sea, when it had received Jonah, was hushed at once, to show that God alone raised and quelled it. It "stood" still, like a servant, when it had accomplished its mission. God, who at all times saith to it <a href="//biblehub.com/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a>, "Hitherto shalt thou come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed," now unseen, as afterward in the flesh <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>, "rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm" . "If we consider the errors of the world before the Passion of Christ, and the conflicting blasts of diverse doctrines, and the vessel, and the whole race of man, i. e., the creature of the Lord, imperiled, and, after His Passion, the tranquility of faith and the peace of the world and the security of all things and the conversion to God, we shall see how, after Jonah was cast in, the sea stood from its raging" . "Jonah, in the sea, a fugitive, shipwrecked, dead, sayeth the tempest-tossed vessel; he sayeth the pagan, aforetime tossed to and fro by the error of the world into divers opinions. And Hosea, Amos, Isaiah, Joel, who prophesied at the same time, could not amend the people in Judaea; whence it appeared that the breakers could not be calmed, save by the death of (Him typified by) the fugitive." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. sea ceased &#8230; raging&#8212;so at Jesus' word (Lu 8:24).

The story the Jews (m) tell of his being let down into the sea to his knees, upon which the sea was calm, but became raging again upon his being taken up; and so, at the second time, to his navel; and the third time to his neck; is all fabulous; but he being wholly thrown in, it raged no more. <p>(m) Pirke Eliezer, c. 10. fol. 10. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jonah/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jonah/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">they took up</span>] With respect and reluctance, with no struggle on his part, or violence on theirs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">her raging</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">her anger</span>. “Maris ira,” Ovid. <span class="ital">Met.</span> I. 330, “iratum mare,” Hor. <span class="ital">Epod.</span> II. 5, 6, are quoted by the commentators.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - They took up, with a certain reverence. <span class="cmt_word">Ceased from her raging;</span> literally, <span class="accented">stood from its anger</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "stood from its tossing." The sudden cessation of the storm showed that it had been sent on Jonah's account, and that the crew had not sinned by executing the sentence upon him. Usually it takes some time for the swell to cease after the wind has sunk: here there was suddenly a great calm (<a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="/amos/3-1.htm">Amos 3:1</a> and <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a> contain the introduction and the leading thought of the whole of the prophetic proclamation. <a href="/amos/3-1.htm">Amos 3:1</a>. "Hear this word which Jehovah speaketh concerning you, O sons of Israel, concerning the whole family which I have brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying: <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>. You only have I acknowledge of all the families of the earth; therefore will I visit all your iniquities upon you." The word of the Lord is addressed to all the family of Israel, which God had brought up out of Egypt, that is to say, to all the twelve tribes of the covenant nation, although in what follows it is the ten tribes of Israel alone who are primarily threatened with the destruction of the kingdom, to indicate at the very outset that Judah might anticipate a similar fate if it did not turn to its God with sincerity. The threat is introduced by the thought that its divine election would not secure the sinful nation against punishment, but that, on the contrary, the relation of grace into which the Lord had entered with Israel demanded the punishment of all evil deeds. This cuts off the root of all false confidence in divine election. "To whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required. The greater the measure of grace, the greater also is the punishment if it is neglected or despised." This is the fundamental law of the kingdom of God. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; does not mean to know, to become acquainted with, or to take knowledge of a person (Hitzig), but acknowledge. Acknowledgment on the part of God is not merely taking notice, but is energetic, embracing man in his inmost being, embracing and penetrating with divine love; so that &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; not only includes the idea of love and care, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-5.htm">Hosea 13:5</a>, but expresses generally the gracious fellowship of the Lord with Israel, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>, and is practically equivalent to electing, including both the motive and the result of election. And because Jehovah had acknowledged, i.e., had singled out and chosen Israel as the nation best fitted to be the vehicle of His salvation, He must of necessity punish all its misdeeds, in order to purify it from the dross of sin, and make it a holy vessel of His saving grace. </body></html>
