The figure of overwhelming waters is a common one in Hebrew song to represent some crushing sorrow, but nowhere is the picture so vivid as here. At the same time the entire absence of any reference to the fish, which would, indeed, be altogether out of place in this picture of a drowning man entangled in seaweed, should be noticed.

When he was in trouble, under the tokens of God's displeasure against him for sin: when we are in affliction we must pray. Being kept alive by miracle, he prayed. A sense of God's good-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, opens the lips in prayer, which were closed with the dread of wrath. Also, where he prayed; in the belly of the fish. No place is amiss for prayer. Men may shut us from communion with one another, but not from communion with God. To whom he prayed; to the Lord his God. This encourages even backsliders to return. What his prayer was. This seems to relate his experience and reflections, then and afterwards, rather than to be the form or substance of his prayer. Jonah reflects on the earnestness of his prayer, and God's readiness to hear and answer. If we would get good by our troubles, we must notice the hand of God in them. He had wickedly fled from the presence of the Lord, who might justly take his Holy Spirit from him, never to visit him more. Those only are miserable, whom God will no longer own and favour. But though he was perplexed, yet not in despair. Jonah reflects on the favour of God to him, when he sought to God, and trusted in him in his distress. He warns others, and tells them to keep close to God. Those who forsake their own duty, forsake their own mercy; those who run away from the work of their place and day, run away from the comfort of it. As far as a believer copies those who observe lying vanities, he forsakes his own mercy, and lives below his privileges. But Jonah's experience encourages others, in all ages, to trust in God, as the God of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The waters compassed me about even to the soul - Words which to others were figures of distress (<a href="/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>. See the introduction to Jonah), "the waters have come even to the soul," were to Jonah realities. Sunk in the deep seas, the water strove to penetrate at every opening. To draw breath, which sustains life, to him would have been death. There was but a breath between him and death. "The deep encompassed me," encircling, meeting him wherever he turned, holding him imprisoned on every side, so that there was no escape, and, if there otherwise had been, he was bound motionless, "the weed was wrapped around my head, like a grave-band." "The weed" was the well known seaweed, which, even near the surface of the sea where man can struggle, twines round him, a peril even to the strong swimmer, entangling him often the more, the more he struggles to extricate himself from it. But to one below, powerless to struggle, it was as his winding sheet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. even to the soul&#8212;that is, threatening to extinguish the animal life.<p>weeds&#8212;He felt as if the seaweeds through which he was dragged were wrapped about his head.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jonah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The former part of this verse seems to be an ingeminating of what was said <span class="bld"><a href="/jonah/2-3.htm" title="For you had cast me into the deep, in the middle of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all your billows and your waves passed over me.">Jonah 2:3</a></span>, and bears the self-same meaning and interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The waters; </span> literally, the waters of the sea; metaphorically, afflictions; mystically, temptations; these last arising from his own guilt, and from the tokens of God’s displeasure against him in so unusual a manner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Compassed me about, even to the soul; </span> to the endangering his life, and were forerunners (as he apprehended) of worse miseries, the foretastes of an eternal damnation: it was a miracle of providence to preserve my life, it was no less wonder of free grace to save my soul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The depth closed me round about; </span> he was carried to the bottom of the sea, lay as in the deepest hole of the sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The weeds were wrapped about my head; </span> not immediately, as some conjecture, by the fish pulling them from the bottom of the sea and swallowing them down, where they wrapped Jonah’s head; but mediately, when the fish swam amidst these: or rather it is a comparative speech; I was no more likely to escape drowning, than a man in the depth of the sea, wrapped up in, and held fast down by, the weeds in the bottom of the sea. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jonah/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The waters compassed me about, even to the soul,....

"Make it heard over the palaces in Ashdod, and over the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumult in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the heart thereof. <a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>. And they know not to do the right, is the saying of Jehovah, who heap up violence and devastation in their palaces." The speaker is Jehovah (<a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>), and the prophets are addressed. Jehovah summons them to send out the cry over the palaces in Ashdod and Egypt (&#1506;&#1500; as in <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>), and to call the inhabitants of these palaces to hear, (1) that they may see the acts of violence, and the abominations in the palaces of Samaria; and (2) that they may be able to bear witness against Israel (<a href="/amos/3-13.htm">Amos 3:13</a>). This turn in the prophecy brings out to view the overflowing excess of the sins and abominations of Israel. The call of the prophets, however, is not to be uttered upon the palaces, so as to be heard far and wide (Baur and others), but over the palaces, to cause the inhabitants of them to draw near. It is they alone, and not the whole population of Ashdod and Egypt, who are to be called nigh; because only the inhabitants of the palace could pronounce a correct sentence as to the mode of life commonly adopted in the palaces of Samaria. Ashdod, one of the Philistian capitals, is mentioned by way of example, as a chief city of the uncircumcised, who were regarded by Israel as godless heathen; and Egypt is mentioned along with it, as the nation whose unrighteousness and ungodliness had once been experienced by Israel to satiety. If therefore such heathen as these are called to behold the unrighteous and dissolute conduct to be seen in the palaces, it must have been great indeed. The mountains of Samaria are not the mountains of the kingdom of Samaria, or the mountains upon which the city of Samaria was situated - for Samaria was not built upon a plurality of mountains, but upon one only (<a href="/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>; <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>) - but the mountains round about Samaria, from which you could look into the city, built upon one isolated hill. The city, built upon the hill of Semer, was situated in a mountain caldron or basin, about two yours in diameter, which was surrounded on all sides by lofty mountains (see at <a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>).<p>(Note: "As the mountains round the hill of Semer are loftier than this hill itself, the enemy might easily discover the internal state of besieged Samaria." V. de Velde, R. i. p. 282.)<p>Mehu&#772;ma&#770;h, noise, tumult, denotes a state of confusion, in which everything is topsy-turvy, and all justice and order are overthrown by open violence (Maurer, Baur). &#8219;Ashu&#772;q&#305;&#772;m, either the oppressed, or, taken as an abstract, the oppression of the poor (cf. <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>). In <a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a> the description is continued in the finite verb: they do not know how to do right; that is to say, injustice has become their nature; and they who heap up sins and violence in their palaces like treasures. </body></html>
