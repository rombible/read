When he was in trouble, under the tokens of God's displeasure against him for sin: when we are in affliction we must pray. Being kept alive by miracle, he prayed. A sense of God's good-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, opens the lips in prayer, which were closed with the dread of wrath. Also, where he prayed; in the belly of the fish. No place is amiss for prayer. Men may shut us from communion with one another, but not from communion with God. To whom he prayed; to the Lord his God. This encourages even backsliders to return. What his prayer was. This seems to relate his experience and reflections, then and afterwards, rather than to be the form or substance of his prayer. Jonah reflects on the earnestness of his prayer, and God's readiness to hear and answer. If we would get good by our troubles, we must notice the hand of God in them. He had wickedly fled from the presence of the Lord, who might justly take his Holy Spirit from him, never to visit him more. Those only are miserable, whom God will no longer own and favour. But though he was perplexed, yet not in despair. Jonah reflects on the favour of God to him, when he sought to God, and trusted in him in his distress. He warns others, and tells them to keep close to God. Those who forsake their own duty, forsake their own mercy; those who run away from the work of their place and day, run away from the comfort of it. As far as a believer copies those who observe lying vanities, he forsakes his own mercy, and lives below his privileges. But Jonah's experience encourages others, in all ages, to trust in God, as the God of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then - ("And") Jonah prayed, i. e., when the three days and nights were passed, he uttered this devotion. The word "prayed" includes thanksgiving, not petition only. It is said of Hannah that she "prayed" <a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>; but her canticle is all one thanksgiving without a single petition. In this thanksgiving Jonah says how his prayers had been heard, but prays no more. God had delivered him from the sea, and be thanks God, in the fish's belly, as undisturbed as in a Church or an oratory, secure that God, who had done so much, would fulfill the rest. He called God, "his" God, who had in so many ways shown Himself to be His, by His revelations, by His inspirations, by His chastisements, and now by His mercy .

Though Jonah had been a praying man, being a good man, and a prophet of the Lord, yet it seems he had not prayed for some time; being disobedient to the will of God, he restrained prayer before him; all the while he was going to Joppa he prayed not; and how indeed could he have the face to pray to him, from whose face he was fleeing? and as soon as he was in the ship he fell asleep, and there lay till he was waked by the shipmaster, who called upon him to arise, and pray to his God; but whether he did or no is not said; and though it is very probable he might, when convicted of his sin, and before he was cast into the sea, and as he was casting into it; his not recorded; but when he was in the fish's belly, "then he prayed"; where it is marvellous he should, or could; it was strange he should be able to breathe, and more strange to breathe spiritually; it was very wonderful he should have the exercise of his reason, and more that he should have the exercise of grace, as faith and hope, as it appears by the following prayer he had. Prayer may be performed any where, on a mountain, in a desert, in the caves and dens of the earth, and in a prison, as it has been; but this is the only time it ever was performed in such a place. Jonah is the only man that ever prayed in a fish's belly: and he prayed unto the Lord as "his God", not merely by creation, and as the God of nature and providence, the God of his life, and of his mercies; but as his covenant God and Father; for though he had sinned against the Lord, and had been sorely chastised by him, yet he did not take his lovingkindness from him, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail, or break his covenant with him; covenant interest and relation still continued; and Jonah had knowledge of it, and faith in it; and as this is an argument the Lord makes use of to engage backsliders to return unto him, it is a great encouragement to them so to do, <a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>. In this Jonah was a type of Christ, who, amidst his agonies, sorrows, and sufferings, prayed to his Father, and claimed his interest in him as his God, <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>. What follows contains the sam and substance of the prophet's thoughts, and the ejaculations of his mind, when in the fish's belly; but were not put up in this form, but were reduced by him into it after he was delivered; as many of David's psalms were put into the form and order they are after his deliverance from troubles, suitable to his thoughts of things when he was in them; and indeed the following account is an historical narration of facts, which were before and after his prayer, as well as of that itself. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/jonah/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> out of the fish's belly,</span><p>(a) Being now swallowed up by death, and seeing no remedy to escape, his faith broke out to the Lord, knowing that out of this very hell he was able to deliver him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/jonah/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1.</span> <span class="ital">Then Jonah prayed</span>] What follows, <span class="ital"><a href="/context/jonah/2-2.htm" title="And said, I cried by reason of my affliction to the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and you heard my voice....">Jonah 2:2-9</a></span>, is rather a thanksgiving than a prayer. The same, however, may be said of Hannah’s utterance (<a href="/context/1_samuel/2-1.htm" title="And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation....">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>), which is introduced by the same word (“Hannah <span class="ital">prayed</span>”).

It is simpler, however, to suppose, with the great majority of commentators, that Jonah had prayed to God in the prospect and the act of being cast into the sea, while he was being buffeted by the waves and sinking into the depths, and in the agony of being swallowed by the fish. During all this time, whether his lips spoke or not, his mind was fixed in that intent Godward attitude and posture which is the truest prayer. Now, however, when he finds himself alive and unharmed in that strange abode, he prays no longer, but offers thanksgivings for the measure of deliverance already granted him in answer to those former prayers, mingled with joyful anticipations of the yet further deliverance which the last verse of the chapter records. It seems probable that Jonah’s prayer was offered at the end of the three days and nights, and was followed immediately by his release. How the three days and nights were spent by him, whether in unconsciousness, as some have thought, or in godly sorrow and repentance, like Saul at Damascus, as others have held, we have no means of knowing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his God</span>] When Jonah flees in disobedience it is “from the presence of Jehovah;” when he prays in penitence, it is to “Jehovah <span class="ital">his God</span>.” Comp. “O Lord my God,” <span class="ital"><a href="/jonah/2-6.htm" title="I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet have you brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.">Jonah 2:6</a></span>, and “<span class="ital">my</span> God,” <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm" title="My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?">Psalm 22:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - Part I. JONAH'S PRAYER AND DELIVERANCE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - 1<span class="accented">. Jonah, in the belly of the fish, offers a prayer of thanksgiving for his rescue from death by drowning, in which he sees a pledge of further deliverance.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jonah prayed.</span> These were his feelings when he sank in the waters and while he lay in his mysterious prison; he may have put them into their metrical form after his deliverance. The grammatical arrangement, and especially the language of ver. 7, seem to speak of a deliverance already experienced rather than of one expected. As this "prayer" does not suit an allegory, and as no cue but Jonah could have known its substance, we have here an argument for his authorship. It is rather a thanksgiving than a prayer - like that of Hennas (<a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). When he realizes that he was saved from drowning, he uttered his gratitude, and saw that he might hope for further rescue. How he passed the three days we cannot tell; some have thought he was unconscious; but thin is, perhaps, hardly consistent with the notice of his praying, and with the action of his great Antitype, who, during his sojourn in the unseen world, "preached to the spirits in prison" (<a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His God.</span> He acknowledges Jehovah as his God. He had proved himself his by inspiration, by chastisement, and now by mercy (Pusey). The following prayer contains ample reminiscences of the Psalms, which would be familiar to a devout Israelite. Those quoted are mostly what have been considered to belong to David's time. if their date is really ascertained. But it is a matter of controversy, incapable of settlement, whether Jonah or the psalmist is the original. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/amos/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But this truth met with contradiction in the nation itself. The proud self-secure sinners would not hear such prophesying as this (compare <a href="/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a>; <a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>.). Amos therefore endeavours, before making any further announcement of the judgment of God, to establish his right and duty to prophesy, by a chain-like series of similes drawn from life. V. 3. "Do two walk together without having agreed? <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>. Does the lion roar in the forest, and he has no prey? does the young lion utter his cry out of his den, without having taken anything? <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>. Does the bird fall into the trap on the ground, when there is no snare for him? does the trap rise up from the earth without making a capture? <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>. Or is the trumpet blown in the city, and the people are not alarmed? or does misfortune happen in the city, and Jehovah has not done it? <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>. For the Lord Jehovah does nothing at all, without having revealed His secret to His servants the prophets. <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>. The lion has roared; who does not fear? the Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who must not prophesy?" The contents of these verses are not to be reduced to the general thought, that a prophet could no more speak without a divine impulse than any other effect could take place without a cause. There was certainly no need for a long series of examples, such as we have in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3-6</a>, to substantiate or illustrate the thought, which a reflecting hearer would hardly have disputed, that there was a connection between cause and effect. The examples are evidently selected with the view of showing that the utterances of the prophet originate with God. This is obvious enough in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>. The first clause, "Do two men walk together, without having agreed as to their meeting?" (no&#772;&#8219;Ad, to betake one's self to a place, to meet together at an appointed place or an appointed time; compare <a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-5.htm">Joshua 11:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a>; not merely to agree together), contains something more than the trivial truth, that two persons do not take a walk together without a previous arrangement. The two who walk together are Jehovah and the prophet (Cyril); not Jehovah and the nation, to which the judgment is predicted (Cocceius, Marck, and others). Amos went as prophet to Samaria or Bethel, because the Lord had sent him thither to preach judgment to the sinful kingdom. But God would not threaten judgment if He had not a nation ripe for judgment before Him. The lion which roars when it has the prey before it is Jehovah (cf. <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>, etc.). &#1496;&#1512;&#1507; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1493; is not to be interpreted according to the second clause, as signifying "without having got possession of its prey" (Hitzig), for the lion is accustomed to roar when it has the prey before it and there is no possibility of its escape, and before it actually seizes it (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>).<p>(Note: The most terrible feature in the roaring of a lion is that with this clarigatio, or, if you prefer it, with this classicum, it declares war. And after the roar there immediately follows both slaughter and laceration. For, as a rule, it only roars with that sharp roar when it has the prey in sight, upon which it immediately springs (Bochart, Hieroz. ii. 25ff., ed. Ros.).)<p>On the contrary, the perfect la&#770;kjad in the second clause is to be interpreted according to the first clause, not as relating to the roar of satisfaction with which the lion devours the prey in its den (Baur), but as a perfect used to describe a thing which was as certain as if it had already occurred. A lion has made a capture not merely when it has actually seized the prey and torn it in pieces, but when the prey has approached so near that it cannot possibly escape. Keph&#305;&#772;r is the young lion which already goes in pursuit of prey, and is to be distinguished from the young of the lion, gu&#772;r (catulus leonis), which cannot yet go in search of prey (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2-3</a>). The two similes have the same meaning. The second strengthens the first by the assertion that God not only has before Him the nation that is ripe for judgment, but that He has it in His power.<p>The similes in <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a> do not affirm the same as those in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>, but contain the new thought, that Israel has deserved the destruction which threatens it. Pach, a snare, and mo&#772;qe&#772;sh, a trap, are frequently used synonymously; but here they are distinguished, pach denoting a bird-net, and mo&#772;qe&#772;sh a springe, a snare which holds the bird fast. The earlier translators have taken mo&#772;qe&#772;sh in the sense of yo&#772;qe&#772;sh, and understand it as referring to the bird-catcher; and Baur proposes to alter the text accordingly. But there is no necessity for this; and it is evidently unsuitable, since it is not requisite for a bird-catcher to be at hand, in order that the bird should be taken in a snare. The suffix la&#770;h refers to tsippo&#772;r, and the thought is this: in order to catch a bird in the net, a springe (gin) must be laid for it. So far as the fact itself is concerned, mo&#772;qe&#772;sh is "evidently that which is necessarily followed by falling into the net; and in this instance it is sinfulness" (Hitzig); so that the meaning of the figure would be this: "Can destruction possibly overtake you, unless your sin draws you into it?" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-35.htm">Jeremiah 2:35</a>). In the second clause pach is the subject, and &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used for the ascent or springing up of the net. Hitzig has given the meaning of the words correctly: "As the net does not spring up without catching the bird, that has sent it up by flying upon it, can ye imagine that when the destruction passes by, ye will not be seized by it, but will escape without injury?" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). Jehovah, however, causes the evil to be foretold. As the trumpet, when blown in the city, frightens the people out of their self-security, so will the voice of the prophet, who proclaims the coming evil, excite a salutary alarm in the nation (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-1.htm">Ezekiel 33:1-5</a>). For the calamity which is bursting upon the city comes from Jehovah, is sent by Him as a punishment. This thought is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, and with this explanation the whole series of figurative sentences is made perfectly clear. The approaching evil, which comes from the Lord, is predicted by the prophet, because Jehovah does not carry out His purpose without having (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, for when, except when he has, as in <a href="/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a>) first of all revealed it to the prophets, that they may warn the people to repent and to reform. So&#772;d receives a more precise definition from the first clause of the verse, or a limitation to the purposes which God is about to fulfil upon His people. And since (this is the connection of <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>) the judgment with which the Lord is drawing near fills every one with fear, and Jehovah has spoken, i.e., has made known His counsel to the prophets, they cannot but prophesy. </body></html>
