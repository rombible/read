When he was in trouble, under the tokens of God's displeasure against him for sin: when we are in affliction we must pray. Being kept alive by miracle, he prayed. A sense of God's good-will to us, notwithstanding our offences, opens the lips in prayer, which were closed with the dread of wrath. Also, where he prayed; in the belly of the fish. No place is amiss for prayer. Men may shut us from communion with one another, but not from communion with God. To whom he prayed; to the Lord his God. This encourages even backsliders to return. What his prayer was. This seems to relate his experience and reflections, then and afterwards, rather than to be the form or substance of his prayer. Jonah reflects on the earnestness of his prayer, and God's readiness to hear and answer. If we would get good by our troubles, we must notice the hand of God in them. He had wickedly fled from the presence of the Lord, who might justly take his Holy Spirit from him, never to visit him more. Those only are miserable, whom God will no longer own and favour. But though he was perplexed, yet not in despair. Jonah reflects on the favour of God to him, when he sought to God, and trusted in him in his distress. He warns others, and tells them to keep close to God. Those who forsake their own duty, forsake their own mercy; those who run away from the work of their place and day, run away from the comfort of it. As far as a believer copies those who observe lying vanities, he forsakes his own mercy, and lives below his privileges. But Jonah's experience encourages others, in all ages, to trust in God, as the God of salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jonah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I cried by reason of mine affliction - , or, "out of affliction" which came "to me." So the Psalmist thanked God in the same words, though in a different order ; "To the Lord in trouble to me I called, and He heard me." He "called," and God heard and answered , "He does not say, I "call," but I "called"; he does not pray for the future, but gives thanks for the past." Strange cause of thankfulness this would seem to most faith, to be alive in such a grave; to abide there hour after hour, and day after day, in one unchanging darkness, carried to and fro helplessly, with no known escape from his fetid prison, except to death! Yet spiritual light shone on that depth of darkness. The voracious creature, which never opened his mouth save to destroy life, had swallowed him, to save it . "What looked like death, became safe-keeping," and so the prophet who had fled to avoid doing the will of God and to do his own, now willed to be carried about, he knew not where, at the will; as it seemed, of the huge animal in which he lay, but in truth, where God directed it, and he gave thanks. God had heard him. The first token of God's mercy was the earnest of the whole. God was dealing with him, was looking on him. It was enough.<p>Out of the belly of hell cried I.-- The deep waters were as a grave, and he was counted "among the dead" <a href="/psalms/88-4.htm">Psalm 88:4</a>. Death seemed so certain that it was all one as if he were in the womb of hell, not to be reborn to life until the last Day. So David said <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>, "The bands of death compassed me round about;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>, "Thou hast drawn my life out of hell." The waters choked his speech; but he cried with a loud cry to God Who knew the heart. "I cried; Thou heardest." The words vary only by a kindred letter . The real heart's cry to God according to the mind of God and His hearing are one, whether, for man's good, He seem at the time to hear or no.<p> "Not of the voice but of the heart is God the Hearer, as He is the Seer. Do the ears of God wait for sound? How then could the prayer of Jonah from the inmost belly of the whale, through the bowels of so great a creature, out of the very bottomless depths, through so great a mass of waters, make its way to heaven?"  "Loud crying to God is not with the voice but with the heart. Many, silent with their lips, have cried aloud with their heart; many, noisy with their lips, could, with heart turned away, obtain nothing. If then thou criest, cry within, where God heareth."  "Jonah cried aloud to God out of the fish's belly, out of the deep of the sea, out of the depths of disobedience; and his prayer reached to God, Who rescued him from the waves, brought him forth out of the vast creature, absolved him from the guilt. Let the sinner too cry aloud, whom, departing from God, the storm of desires overwhelmed, the malignant Enemy devoured, the waves of this present world sucked under! Let him own that he is in the depth, that so his prayer may reach to God." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jonah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. His prayer is partly descriptive and precatory, partly eucharistical. Jonah incorporates with his own language inspired utterances familiar to the Church long before in Jon 2:2, Ps 120:1; in Jon 2:3, Ps 42:7; in Jon 2:4, Ps 31:22; in Jon 2:5, Ps 69:1; in Jon 2:7, Ps 142:3; 18:6; in Jon 2:8, Ps 31:6; in Jon 2:9, Ps 116:17, 18, and 3:8. Jonah, an inspired man, thus attests both the antiquity and inspiration of the Psalms. It marks the spirit of faith, that Jonah identifies himself with the saints of old, appropriating their experiences as recorded in the Word of God (Ps 119:50). Affliction opens up the mine of Scripture, before seen only on the surface.<p>out of the belly of hell&#8212;Sheol, the unseen world, which the belly of the fish resembled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jonah/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And said:</span> the former verse was a general account that he prayed, this word in the front of this verse is a transition to a more full account of his prayer, what for substance, and somewhat of the words also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I cried; </span> not with a loud voice of the tongue, as it was not ordinarily feasible in so close a prison, so nor was it necessary he should, where none were to hear but his God, who heareth the strongest desires, and accounts them the strongest cries; so Jonah cried with his whole heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By reason of mine affliction; </span> distress, or straits with which he was encompasseth and close besieged; nor was there ever closer siege laid to any one, his body and mind both shut up, the one by the monstrous dungeon of the fish’s belly, and the other by the terrors of the Almighty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the Lord:</span> it was in many respects fit Jonah should petition God, for he was committed by his special warrant, and none either had power or authority to deliver him but God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He heard me:</span> though Jonah say not how God did hear, in what particular, yet he knew both how and in what; the support of his person, the exercise of his reason, the workings of his heart toward God, and a hope or assurance that lie should be delivered, were part of the mercy God gave, and he prayed for. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of the belly of hell cried I; </span> the grave, so <span class="ital">Sheol</span>; so it was as dark to Jonah, and had been as destructive too, if mercy had not prevented.

Not unto the Lord in prayer, but to others, to whom he communicated what passed between God and him in this time of distress; how he prayed to him, and was heard by him; what a condition he had been in, and how he was delivered out of it; what was his frame of mind while in it, sometimes despairing, and sometimes hoping; and how thankful he was for this salvation, and was determined to praise the Lord for it: <p>I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; or, "out of my strait" (a); being straitened in his body, and as it were in a prison in the fish's belly; and straitened in his soul, being between hope and despair, and under the apprehensions of the divine displeasure. A time of affliction is a time for prayer; it brings those to it that have disused it; it made Jonah cry to his God, if not with a loud voice, yet inwardly; and his cry was powerful and piercing, it reached the heavens, and entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts, though out of the depths, and out of the belly of a fish, in the midst of the sea: <p>out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice; or, "out of the belly of the grave" (b); out of the midst of it; that is, out of the belly of the fish, which was as a grave to him, as Jarchi observes; where he lay as out of the land of the living, as one dead, and being given up for dead: and it may also respect the frame of his mind, the horror and terror lie was in, arising from a sense of his sins, and the apprehensions he had of the wrath of God, which were as a hell in his conscience; and amidst all this he cried to God, and he heard him; and not only delivered him from he fish's belly, but from those dreadful apprehensions he had of his state and condition; and spoke peace and pardon to him. This is a proof that this prayer or thanksgiving be it called which it will, was composed, as to the form and order of it, after his deliverance; and these words are an appeal to God for the truth of what he had said in the preceding clause, and not a repetition of it in prayer; or expressing the same thing in different words. <p>(a) "ex angustia mea", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "ex arcto mihi", Cocceius.

The words of the Psalter, however, are not exactly and literally quoted, but its ideas and phrases are freely wrought into the prayer, as if drawn from the well-stored memory of a pious Israelite, familiar with its contents, and naturally giving vent to his feelings in the cherished forms, which were now instinct for him with new life and meaning. The manner in which our English literature (not only sacred, but secular and even profane and infidel) abounds in Scripture imagery and phraseology may help us to understand how coincidences of this kind may have arisen, without any deliberate intention on the part of a later writer to copy from an earlier, or even any direct consciousness that he was doing so.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by reason of mine affliction</span>] Rather, as in A.V. and R.V. margin, <span class="bld">out of mine affliction</span>, i.e. out of the midst of it, while it still compassed me about. The time referred to is when he was in the sea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first half of this verse is identical in the Heb. words, though not in their order, with <a href="/psalms/120-1.htm" title="In my distress I cried to the LORD, and he heard me.">Psalm 120:1</a>, except that in the Psalm we have “in,” instead of “from” or “out of” mine affliction, and a lengthened form of the word for affliction is used. The coincidence cannot, however, be properly said to affect the date of the Book of Jonah. The Psalm, it is true, belongs to a collection which “in its present form must have been made after the return from Babylon,” but it by no means follows that no ode of the collection had been composed before that time. Besides, the whole sentence is, both in language and idea, too commonplace, so to speak, to be safely insisted upon as a quotation at all. Two quite independent writers may easily have lighted on it. And moreover, if quoted at all, it may owe its origin no less probably to Psalms 18, between which and the prayer of Jonah the resemblance, though less exact in this particular verse, is as a whole more close and striking. Comp. <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm" title="In my distress I called on the LORD, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.">Psalm 18:6</a> (1st clause).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of hell</span>] <span class="bld">The unseen world</span>, the place of the dead, amongst whom, when cast into the sea, he seemed already to be numbered.

The proud self-secure sinners would not hear such prophesying as this (compare <a href="/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4</a>; <a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>.). Amos therefore endeavours, before making any further announcement of the judgment of God, to establish his right and duty to prophesy, by a chain-like series of similes drawn from life. V. 3. "Do two walk together without having agreed? <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>. Does the lion roar in the forest, and he has no prey? does the young lion utter his cry out of his den, without having taken anything? <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>. Does the bird fall into the trap on the ground, when there is no snare for him? does the trap rise up from the earth without making a capture? <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>. Or is the trumpet blown in the city, and the people are not alarmed? or does misfortune happen in the city, and Jehovah has not done it? <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>. For the Lord Jehovah does nothing at all, without having revealed His secret to His servants the prophets. <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>. The lion has roared; who does not fear? the Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who must not prophesy?" The contents of these verses are not to be reduced to the general thought, that a prophet could no more speak without a divine impulse than any other effect could take place without a cause. There was certainly no need for a long series of examples, such as we have in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3-6</a>, to substantiate or illustrate the thought, which a reflecting hearer would hardly have disputed, that there was a connection between cause and effect. The examples are evidently selected with the view of showing that the utterances of the prophet originate with God. This is obvious enough in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>. The first clause, "Do two men walk together, without having agreed as to their meeting?" (no&#772;&#8219;Ad, to betake one's self to a place, to meet together at an appointed place or an appointed time; compare <a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-5.htm">Joshua 11:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a>; not merely to agree together), contains something more than the trivial truth, that two persons do not take a walk together without a previous arrangement. The two who walk together are Jehovah and the prophet (Cyril); not Jehovah and the nation, to which the judgment is predicted (Cocceius, Marck, and others). Amos went as prophet to Samaria or Bethel, because the Lord had sent him thither to preach judgment to the sinful kingdom. But God would not threaten judgment if He had not a nation ripe for judgment before Him. The lion which roars when it has the prey before it is Jehovah (cf. <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/11-10.htm">Hosea 11:10</a>, etc.). &#1496;&#1512;&#1507; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1493; is not to be interpreted according to the second clause, as signifying "without having got possession of its prey" (Hitzig), for the lion is accustomed to roar when it has the prey before it and there is no possibility of its escape, and before it actually seizes it (cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>).<p>(Note: The most terrible feature in the roaring of a lion is that with this clarigatio, or, if you prefer it, with this classicum, it declares war. And after the roar there immediately follows both slaughter and laceration. For, as a rule, it only roars with that sharp roar when it has the prey in sight, upon which it immediately springs (Bochart, Hieroz. ii. 25ff., ed. Ros.).)<p>On the contrary, the perfect la&#770;kjad in the second clause is to be interpreted according to the first clause, not as relating to the roar of satisfaction with which the lion devours the prey in its den (Baur), but as a perfect used to describe a thing which was as certain as if it had already occurred. A lion has made a capture not merely when it has actually seized the prey and torn it in pieces, but when the prey has approached so near that it cannot possibly escape. Keph&#305;&#772;r is the young lion which already goes in pursuit of prey, and is to be distinguished from the young of the lion, gu&#772;r (catulus leonis), which cannot yet go in search of prey (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-2.htm">Ezekiel 19:2-3</a>). The two similes have the same meaning. The second strengthens the first by the assertion that God not only has before Him the nation that is ripe for judgment, but that He has it in His power.<p>The similes in <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a> do not affirm the same as those in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>, but contain the new thought, that Israel has deserved the destruction which threatens it. Pach, a snare, and mo&#772;qe&#772;sh, a trap, are frequently used synonymously; but here they are distinguished, pach denoting a bird-net, and mo&#772;qe&#772;sh a springe, a snare which holds the bird fast. The earlier translators have taken mo&#772;qe&#772;sh in the sense of yo&#772;qe&#772;sh, and understand it as referring to the bird-catcher; and Baur proposes to alter the text accordingly. But there is no necessity for this; and it is evidently unsuitable, since it is not requisite for a bird-catcher to be at hand, in order that the bird should be taken in a snare. The suffix la&#770;h refers to tsippo&#772;r, and the thought is this: in order to catch a bird in the net, a springe (gin) must be laid for it. So far as the fact itself is concerned, mo&#772;qe&#772;sh is "evidently that which is necessarily followed by falling into the net; and in this instance it is sinfulness" (Hitzig); so that the meaning of the figure would be this: "Can destruction possibly overtake you, unless your sin draws you into it?" (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/2-35.htm">Jeremiah 2:35</a>). In the second clause pach is the subject, and &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used for the ascent or springing up of the net. Hitzig has given the meaning of the words correctly: "As the net does not spring up without catching the bird, that has sent it up by flying upon it, can ye imagine that when the destruction passes by, ye will not be seized by it, but will escape without injury?" (cf. <a href="/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a>). Jehovah, however, causes the evil to be foretold. As the trumpet, when blown in the city, frightens the people out of their self-security, so will the voice of the prophet, who proclaims the coming evil, excite a salutary alarm in the nation (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-1.htm">Ezekiel 33:1-5</a>). For the calamity which is bursting upon the city comes from Jehovah, is sent by Him as a punishment. This thought is explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, and with this explanation the whole series of figurative sentences is made perfectly clear. The approaching evil, which comes from the Lord, is predicted by the prophet, because Jehovah does not carry out His purpose without having (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, for when, except when he has, as in <a href="/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a>) first of all revealed it to the prophets, that they may warn the people to repent and to reform. So&#772;d receives a more precise definition from the first clause of the verse, or a limitation to the purposes which God is about to fulfil upon His people. And since (this is the connection of <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>) the judgment with which the Lord is drawing near fills every one with fear, and Jehovah has spoken, i.e., has made known His counsel to the prophets, they cannot but prophesy. </body></html>
