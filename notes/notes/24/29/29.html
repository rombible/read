He does not act as Shemaiah wished him. At the most he only uses the letters as a threat, possibly to put the prophet on his guard against the machinations of his enemies, possibly also to induce him to moderate his tone. We are reminded of the like conduct of the Pharisees who reported Herod’s threats to our Lord, in <a href="/luke/13-31.htm" title="The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill you.">Luke 13:31</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:20-32 Jeremiah foretells judgments upon the false prophets, who deceived the Jews in Babylon. Lying was bad; lying to the people of the Lord, to delude them into a false hope, was worse; but pretending to rest their own lies upon the God of truth, was worst of all. They flattered others in their sins, because they could not reprove them without condemning themselves. The most secret sins are known to God; and there is a day coming when he will bring to light all the hidden works of darkness. Shemaiah urges the priests to persecute Jeremiah. Their hearts are wretchedly hardened who justify doing mischief by having power to do it. They were in a miserable thraldom for mocking the messengers of the Lord, and misusing his prophets; yet in their distress they trespass still more against the Lord. Afflictions will not of themselves cure men of their sins, unless the grace of God works with them. Those who slight the blessings, deserve to lose the benefit of God's word, like Shemaiah. The accusations against many active Christians in all ages, amount to no more than this, that they earnestly counsel men to attend to their true interest and duties, and to wait for the performance of God's promises in his appointed way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This captivity is long - Rather, It is long.

Zephaniah &#8230; read &#8230; in the ears of Jeremiah&#8212;He seems to have been less prejudiced against Jeremiah than the others; hence he reads the charge to the prophet, that he should not be condemned without a hearing. This accords with Shemaiah's imputation against Zephaniah for want of zeal against Jeremiah (Jer 29:26, 27). Hence the latter was chosen by King Zedekiah as one of the deputation to Jeremiah (Jer 21:1; 37:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is uncertain whether Zephaniah did this out of kindness to Jeremiah, for we read he was sent to Jeremiah upon messages, <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a> 37:3</span>, from the king, or because he would not apprehend him before he heard him, and let him know that he did nothing against him but upon information, &c. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/jeremiah/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter,....

"Thus saith Jahveh, the God of hosts, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy to you in my name falsely: Behold, I give them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, that he may smite them before your eyes. <a href="/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>. And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the exiles of Judah that are in Babylon, saying: Jahveh make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire, <a href="/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>. Because they have done folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken in my name lying words which I have not commanded them. But I know it and am witness, saith Jahveh." - Beyond what is here told, we know nothing of these two pseudo-prophets. The name &#1488;&#1495;&#1488;&#1489; is written in <a href="/jeremiah/29-20.htm">Jeremiah 29:20</a> without &#1488;; thus the Kametz comes to be under the &#1495;, and in consequence of this the Pathach is changed into a Seghol "Smite," i.e., slay. The manner of their death is called, probably with allusion to the name Kolaiah, &#1511;&#1500;&#1492;, roast, burn in a heated furnace; a mode of execution usual in Babylon, acc. to <a href="/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a>. This punishment is to fall on them because of two kinds of sin: 1. Because they have done folly in Israel, namely, committed adultery with their neighbours' wives; 2. Because they have prophesied falsely in the name of Jahveh. Except in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>, the phrase: commit folly in Israel, is always used of the grosser sins of uncleanness; see on <a href="/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a>. So here also. - The Chet. &#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is expounded in the Keri by &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, according to which there has been a transposition of the letters &#1493; and &#1497;, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-6.htm">Jeremiah 8:6</a>, etc. Still the article here is extraordinary, since &#1506;&#1491; has none. Therefore J. D. Mich., Ew., Hitz., Graf suppose we should read &#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, the &#1488; having been dropped from &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in scriptio continua, as it often is, especially after &#1497;, in &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; and other words, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-15.htm">Jeremiah 19:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-16.htm">Jeremiah 39:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>, etc. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is then the copula between subject and predicate, as in <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; cf. Ew. 297, b. </body></html>
