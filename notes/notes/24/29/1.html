Among these also, probably in connection with the projects which we have traced in the preceding chapter, there was a restless disquietude, fostered by false prophets, who urged the people to rebel against their conquerors. Against that policy Jeremiah, in accordance with the convictions on which he had all along acted, enters an earnest protest. The letter was sent by special messengers, of whom we read in <a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm" title="By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,">Jeremiah 29:3</a>, and shows that Jeremiah had been kept well informed of all that passed at Babylon. The spelling of the prophet’s name, in the Hebrew text, as Jeremiah, instead of the form Jeremia<span class= "ital">hu</span>, which is the more common form throughout the book, is probably an indication that the opening verse which introduces the letter was the work of a later hand. The date of the letter was probably early in the reign of Zedekiah, before the incidents of the previous chapter. It is brought before us as following in almost immediate sequel on the deportation mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm" title="(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)">Jeremiah 29:2</a>. The term “residue of the elders,” in connexion with “priests and prophets,” points to the fact that the whole body of counsellors, so named, had not been carried into exile, but only the more prominent members. Such “elders” we find in <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.">Ezekiel 20:1</a>. Ezekiel himself may be thought of as among the priests and prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/jeremiah/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/29-1.htm" title="Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;">Jeremiah 29:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now these are the words of the letter — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">דברי הספר</span>, <span class="ital">the words of the book, </span>or <span class="ital">writing, </span>as both the LXX. and the Vulgate translate it. Although this title announces but one, Blaney gives it as his opinion that this chapter undeniably contains the substance of two writings sent at different times, which, he says, “is evident from comparing <a href="/jeremiah/29-28.htm" title="For therefore he sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.">Jeremiah 29:28</a> with <a href="/context/jeremiah/29-4.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon;...">Jeremiah 29:4-5</a>, and that the distinction between them is at the end of <a href="/jeremiah/29-20.htm" title="Hear you therefore the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:">Jeremiah 29:20</a>. For in the first the prophet exhorts the captives to accommodate themselves to their present circumstances, under an assurance that their captivity would last to the end of seventy years; after which period, and not before, God would visit and restore them. And to prevent their listening to any false suggestions that might flatter them with hopes of a speedier return, he informs them of what would happen to their brethren that were left behind at Jerusalem, for whom a harder fate was reserved than for those that had been carried away. After this, finding, as it should seem, upon the return of the messengers, the little credit the first message had met with, he sends a second to the same persons, denouncing the divine judgments against three of their false prophets, by whose influence chiefly the people had been prevented from hearkening to his good advice.” The time when one or both of these written declarations of the divine will was sent to Babylon is not known, but it is thought to have been at the beginning of Zedekiah’s reign. By <span class="ital">the residue of the elders, </span>Lowth thinks that the remnant of the members of the Sanhedrim is intended, who were carried away captive in the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign, (<a href="/daniel/1-3.htm" title="And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;">Daniel 1:3</a>,) or in Jeconiah’s captivity, (see <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2 Kings 24:14</a>,) many of whom might die by the hardships they suffered in their transportation. These, being persons of authority, were more likely to influence the rest of the people, and induce them to hearken to the prophet’s advice. Houbigant, however, not content with this interpretation, renders it, <span class="ital">Unto the principal elders. </span>Instead <span class="ital">of prophets, </span>here the LXX. read <span class="greekheb">ψευδοπροφητας</span>, <span class="ital">false prophets: </span>but the Chaldee understands by the word the scribes or doctors of the law; while others again think that Ezekiel, (carried away with Jeconiah,) Daniel, and other prophets of the captivity, may be meant.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/jeremiah/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-7 The written word of God is as truly given by inspiration of God as his spoken word. The zealous servant of the Lord will use every means to profit those who are far off, as well as those who are near him. The art of writing is very profitable for this end; and by the art of printing it is rendered most beneficial for circulating the knowledge of the word of God. God's sending to the captives by this letter would show that he had not forsaken them, though he was displeased, and corrected them. If they live in the fear of God, they may live comfortably in Babylon. In all conditions of life, it is our wisdom and duty not to throw away the comfort of what we may have, because we have not all we would have. They are directed to seek the good of the country where they were captives. While the king of Babylon protected them, they must live quiet and peaceable lives under him, in all godliness and honesty; patiently leaving it to God to work deliverance for them in due time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/jeremiah/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The residue of the ciders - i. e., such of the elders as were still alive. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/jeremiah/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 29<p>Jer 29:1-32.

The argument and tenor, the sum and substance, of an epistle, which the prophet Jeremiah, being at Jerusalem, wrote, under the inspiration of God, to his countrymen abroad, afterwards described; so the prophets under the Old Testament instructed the people, sometimes by their sermons and discourses delivered by word of mouth to them, and sometimes by letters and epistles; as did the apostles of the New Testament; and they were both ways useful and profitable to men: <p>unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captive; some perhaps dying by the way, and others quickly after they came to Babylon; some were left, who had been rulers or civil magistrates in Judea, and perhaps of the great sanhedrim: <p>and to the priests, and to the prophets: false prophets, as the Syriac version; for we read only of one true prophet that was carried captive, and that was Ezekiel; but of false prophets several: <p>and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; which was eleven or twelve years before their last captivity thither.

Moreover, he and others consider the whole or the greater part of <span class="ital"><a href="/jeremiah/29-2.htm" title="(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)">Jeremiah 29:2</a></span> to be an expansion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The residue of the elders</span>; i.e. the surviving elders.

"Thus saith Jahveh: Yokes of wood hast thou broken, but hast made in place of them yokes of iron. <a href="/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a>. For thus saith Jahveh of hosts, the God of Israel: A yoke of iron I lay upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him; and the beasts of the field also have I given him." - When the prophet says: Yokes of wood hast thou broken, etc., we are not to understand him as speaking of the breaking of the wooden yoke Jeremiah had been wearing; he gives the deeper meaning of that occurrence. By breaking Jeremiah's wooden yoke, Hananiah has only signified that the yoke Nebuchadnezzar lays on the nations will not be so easily broken as a wooden one, but is of iron, i.e., not to be broken. The plural "yokes" is to be explained by the emblematical import of the words, and is not here to be identified, as it sometimes may be, with the singular, <a href="/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10</a>. <a href="/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a> shows in what sense Hananiah put an iron yoke in the place of the wooden one: Jahveh will lay iron yokes on all nations, that they may serve the king of Babel. Hananiah's breaking the wooden yoke does not alter the divine decree, but is made to contribute to its fuller revelation. With the last clause of <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a>, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>. - Hereupon Jeremiah forewarns the false prophets what is to be God's punishment on them for their false and audacious declarations. <a href="/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15</a>. "Hear now, Hananiah: Jahveh hath not sent thee, and thou hast made this people to believe a lie. <a href="/jeremiah/28-16.htm">Jeremiah 28:16</a>. Therefore thus saith Jahveh: Behold, I cast thee from off the face of the earth; this year shalt thou die, for thou hast spoken rebellion against Jahveh." "The year"  equals  this year, as in <a href="/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>. The words "for thou hast spoken," etc., recall <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>. They involve an application to Hananiah's case of the command there given to put such a prophet to death, and show how it can with justice be said that the Lord will cast him from off the face of the earth. The verb &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1498; is chosen for the sake of the play on &#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1498;. God has not sent him as prophet to His people, but will send him away from off the earth, i.e., cause him to die. - In <a href="/jeremiah/28-17.htm">Jeremiah 28:17</a> it is recorded that this saying was soon fulfilled. Hananiah died in the seventh month of that year, i.e., two months after his controversy with Jeremiah (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a>). </body></html>
